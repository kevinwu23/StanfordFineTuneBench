SEATTLE (AP) — Kumar Rocker’s debut in the majors finally arrived. It was a mixed bag for his highly anticipated first outing. 
Rocker threw four innings for the Texas Rangers on Thursday night in their series opener against the Seattle Mariners. It was the conclusion of a lengthy journey through the pro game for the one-time college phenom and the top pitching prospect in the Rangers organization. 
With his parents watching from the stands, Rocker endured a shaky start, giving up a single to Victor Robles on the first pitch of his career and a dribbling single to Julio Rodriguez. But he escaped the first without damage getting strikeouts of Cal Raleigh and Randy Arozarena, and a flyout to the warning track from Luke Raley.
He eventually struck out seven, at times leaving Seattle hitters guessing. Rocker missed a chance to leave with the lead after giving up the first run of his career on Justin Turner’s solo homer in the fourth, but watched as his teammates came back from a three-run deficit to claim a 5-4 win over the Mariners. 
Rocker was pulled after throwing 74 pitches. He allowed three hits and walked two to go along with the seven strikeouts. 
“We got him where we wanted him, around 75 pitches, and he’s got to feel good about that start,” manager Bruce Bochy said. “I’m sure he was nervous out there, and then the first two guys get hits, and, you know, he’s got runners in scoring position, nobody out, and he made pitches when he had to. So it says a lot about him.”


After being a dominant star in college at Vanderbilt, Rocker was the 10th overall pick by the Mets in 2021 amateur draft and went unsigned due to medical concerns. Texas drafted him third overall in 2022 and he has recovered from Tommy John surgery in May 2023 to earn the promotion leading to Thursday’s debut.
“It’s been an incredible journey,” Kumar Rocker’s mother, Lu Rocker said on the Rangers TV broadcast. “And he’s just come out just fighting, putting his head down, and just working hard.”
Rocker smiled when talking about having his parents in the stands for his first start in the big leagues.
“(It means) a lot. I’ve been blessed,” Rocker said. “And I also play for them. Everything I do is for them, from college to here, just trying to make them proud.”
Texas general manager Chris Young said it was a “fun weekend” for the Rangers with Rocker’s debut, followed by Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer scheduled to start Friday and Saturday. 
“Obviously we’re getting Max and Jacob back on subsequent days and then on top of that having our top draft pick from a couple of years ago make his debut. Someone who is not just making a September debut, someone who has really kind of flown through the minor leagues because of his performance who has now earned the opportunity to pitch in the big leagues,” Young said. 
The 24-year-old Rocker has a 1.96 ERA in 10 games for three different Rangers affiliates since July 5. In his final two starts for Triple-A Round Rock, he had 18 strikeouts over 10 innings, and finished with 47 strikeouts and four walks in 29 2/3 innings over seven starts combined for Double-A Frisco and Round Rock.
“I’m excited. I’ll say that. The fans should be. This is a big part of our future when you’re looking at Kumar and Jack (Leiter) and young guys that come up,” Bochy said. 
For Rocker, the key to bouncing back from his tough start to the game was to rely on his “favorites”— a sinker, and his wipeout slider that helped lead to 17 swings and misses from Seattle.
“That’s the beauty of that pitch,” Rocker said. “I’m glad I have it, glad I work on it, and things can be a little bit better once that (fastball) command comes back.”
Rocker’s dad, Tracy, is the defensive line coach for the Tennessee Titans. Tracy Rocker left the team following practice on Thursday to fly to see his son make his first start.
“Forget being a coach. Now he’s the happiest parent, you know, one of the happiest parents in the world,” Titans defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson said. “And to be able to go to see your son throw out the first pitch in a Major League Baseball game and your son has gone through the adversity he has and went through the minors to get to this point? Man, it’s a hell of a feeling.”
While the journey to get to the big leagues was long and winding, Rocker’s parents never had a doubt he’d get here.
“At 2 years old, I told my husband he’s going to be a pitcher,” Lu Rocker said.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A fire in a school dormitory in Kenya has killed 18 students and 27 others have been hospitalized, with 70 children unaccounted for, the country’s deputy president said Friday. 
President William Ruto declared three days of mourning during which flags will be flown at half-staff in honor of the children who died.
Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua said only 86 out of more than 150 children had been accounted for, and urged community members who may have sheltered some of them to help account for them.
Gachagua said that one more student had died at the hospital and that 37 pupils had been reunited with their parents so far.
The cause of the fire Thursday night at Hillside Endarasha Primary school in Nyeri County was being investigated, police spokesperson Resila Onyango said. The school serves children up to the age of 14.
Nyeri County Commissioner Pius Murugu and the education ministry reported that the dormitory that caught fire housed more than 150 boys between ages 10 and 14. Since most of the buildings are made from wooden planks, the fire spread quickly.
The mixed day and boarding private school, which has 824 students, is located 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi, in the country’s central highlands, where wooden structures are common.
Nyeri County Gov. Mutahi Kahiga told journalists that rescue efforts were hampered by muddy roads caused by rains in the area.


Anxious parents who had been unable to find their children among the survivors waited at the school, engulfed with grief.
The parents were overcome by emotions after they were allowed to view the scene of the fire.
John Rukwaro told journalists that his 11-year-old grandson was missing and he had checked with area hospitals without success.
The education ministry’s permanent secretary, Belio Kipsang, said that the government was working with the school administration to account for all the children in the boarding section.
“We are asking the parents who picked up their children and the community to support us as we consolidate the numbers to ensure that we account for every child who was boarding in this school,” he said.
Ruto called the news “devastating.” 
“I instruct relevant authorities to thoroughly investigate this horrific incident. Those responsible will be held to account,” he said in an X post.
His deputy, Rigathi Gachagua, urged school administrators to ensure that safety guidelines recommended by the education ministry for boarding schools are being followed.
School fires are common in Kenyan boarding schools, often caused by arson fueled by drug abuse and overcrowding, according to a recent education ministry report. Many students board because parents believe it gives them more time to study without long commutes.
Some fires have been started by students during protests over the workload or living conditions. In 2017, 10 high school students died in a school fire in Nairobi started by a student.
Kenya’s deadliest school fire in recent history was in 2001 when 67 students died in a dormitory fire in Machakos county.
The education ministry’s guidelines recommend that dormitories should be spacious enough and have two doors on each end, an emergency door in the middle and that windows aren’t fitted with grills in order to allow for escape in case of fire. Fully serviced fire extinguishers and fire alarms are required at easily accessible spots. 
It wasn’t immediately clear if these guidelines were followed at Hillside school and the area near the dormitory has remained cordoned off.",False

BERLIN (AP) — Rafael Nadal withdrew Thursday from next week’s Laver Cup in Berlin, leaving it unclear when the Spanish great will play again.
The Laver Cup — the tournament where Roger Federer retired in 2022 after teaming up with Nadal in doubles — would have been Nadal’s first event since the Paris Olympics and potentially one of his last ever.
“I’m really disappointed to share that I won’t be able to compete at the Laver Cup in Berlin next week,” the 38-year-old Nadal said. “This is a team competition and to really support Team Europe, I need to do what’s best for them and at this moment there are other players who can help the team deliver the win.”
The 22-time Grand Slam champion didn’t address his current fitness after a spate of injuries in recent years, or when he might play again.
Nadal withdrew last month from the U.S. Open, meaning he missed three of the four Grand Slam tournaments in 2024. He last played in reaching the men’s doubles quarterfinals at the Olympics, where he also lost in the second round of singles to Novak Djokovic.
The Laver Cup, to be held from Sept. 20-22, is an indoor hard-court men’s competition pitting Team Europe against Team World in a format reminiscent of golf’s Ryder Cup. No replacement for Nadal was immediately announced.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Kelsey Plum scored 29 points, A’ja Wilson had 24 points and 13 rebounds, and the Las Vegas Aces closed out the Seattle Storm 83-76 on Tuesday night to advance to the semifinals of the WNBA playoffs for the sixth consecutive season.
Las Vegas, which has won 11 straight home games in the playoffs, swept the best-of-three series to set up a rematch of the 2023 WNBA Finals against top-seeded New York starting Sunday. The Aces are trying to become the first team to win three titles in a row since Houston won four straight from 1997-2000 in the league’s first four seasons.
Wilson set a WNBA record by recording 20-plus points and at least 10 rebounds in 13 career playoff games, passing Tamika Catchings and Candace Parker. The WNBA MVP, who missed her first six shots in Game 1, went 5 of 7 from the field in the first quarter and finished 9 of 17.
After Seattle took its first lead of the game with 7:58 left in the fourth quarter, the Aces scored the next seven points for a 71-65 lead on Jackie Young’s fast-break layup.
The Storm had a chance to get within 78-74 with 2:22 left but Ezi Magbegor missed both free throws. Chelsea Gray answered at the other end with a jumper from the free-throw line for an eight-point lead. Tiffany Hayes sealed it with a layup in traffic with 46 seconds to play.
Gray had 12 points and nine assists for Las Vegas. Plum, who was held to only two points in Game 1, finished 11 of 15 from the field.


Gabby Williams scored 20 points and Nneka Ogwumike had 16 points and 10 rebounds for Seattle. Magbegor, who missed Game 1 due to a concussion, added 14 points, Skylar Diggins-Smith scored 13 and Jewell Loyd was held to nine points on 3-of-11 shooting. Seattle was 6 of 12 from 3-point range in the first half before finishing 8 of 23.
Las Vegas made nine straight shots in the first quarter to build an early double-digit lead. Wilson completed a three-point play and Gray sank a 3-pointer on the next possession as Las Vegas opened the game on a 15-4 run. Plum and Gray each added a 3-pointer on back-to-back possessions to extend it to 23-7. 
Wilson, Plum and Gray combined to score all of Las Vegas’ 28 first-quarter points.
Seattle went on a 9-0 run in the second quarter to get within 39-38 as Las Vegas went more than four minutes without making a field goal. But the Aces closed the half on a 6-0 run, capped by Wilson’s two free throws with 2.8 seconds left.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — It had probably been a minute since a businessman worth $4.1 billion dropped an F-bomb on live television. How many, though, had as good a reason as Phillies owner John Middleton to teeter on the profane after clinching the NL East championship?
Manager Rob Thomson finished a brief clubhouse pep talk to his Phillies team dressed in red “We Own the EAST” T-shirts, goggles strapped to their heads, a bottle of bubbly in each hand, when he welcomed Middleton to the floor.
With that, Middleton blurted, “I want my (expletive) trophy back.”
Middleton, Thomson and the rest of the Phillies would spend the night pickled in a broth of beer and booze and reeking from the smoky aroma from cigars puffed throughout the clubhouse.
The Phillies had reason to cut loose, after reaching the playoffs two straight seasons as a wild card, Bryce Harper, Kyle Schwarber, Trea Turner, Aaron Nola and the rest at last broke through to clinch a division title for the first time in 13 years.
It’s a start.
That trophy Middleton wants back in Philly?
Well, the Commissioner’s Trophy awarded each season to the World Series champion hasn’t called Philly home since 2008. The championship drought has stretched so long, 2008 stars Ryan Howard, Joe Blanton, Jamie Moyer and Shane Victorino have since all found a new team — the Savannah Bananas.
Barring a scenario of improbable results over the final five games, the Phillies are poised to open Game 1 of the NL Division Series on Oct. 5 at Citizens Bank Park.


Zack Wheeler, a leading Cy Young Award contender, is sure to get the start. But for Game 2? The Phillies could turn to the winning pitcher in Monday’s clincher, Nola. Or even Cristopher Sánchez. One reason to give the nod for a home start to Sánchez is this, he has a 2.05 ERA in Philly this season, compared to a whopping 5.02 ERA on the road.
The postseason party is underway. There’s still plenty at stake this week, both in the final two games of a home set against the Chicago Cubs before the Phillies end the season with three games in Washington.
The Phillies rely heavily on Harper, their $330 million franchise star who has keyed their run toward an NL East title. He’s battled wrist problems since May while he developed elbow issues down the stretch.
The two-time NL MVP’s power numbers suffered a significant dip since the All-Star break. He didn’t homer between Aug. 9 and Sept. 14 and has added just one more to his total, giving him 29.
“I feel like it’s getting better,” Harper said on the field, an hour or so after he partied shirtless in the clubhouse. “I feel like my swings are OK.”
Thomson said he wouldn’t risk his players’ health this week just to earn the No. 1 seed, but a break with the wild-card round bye could help all the banged-up Phillies.
“I think the bye’s going to help a lot of our team,” Harper said. “I think a lot of guys are kind of grinding through right now a lot of stuff. Kind of getting that reset, kind of hitting that pause for a minute.”
When Harper is healthy, he’s as feared as any slugger in the postseason. He batted .500 in the 2022 NLDS against Atlanta, followed with NLCS MVP honors against San Diego, and he lived up to his “Showman” nickname in last year’s NLDS against the Braves with two homers, two staredowns and four RBIs in a Game 3 win.
The Phillies knocked off St. Louis and the Miami Marlins in the Wild Card Series each of the last two seasons before they defeated the Braves in the Division Series each year in the next round.
Yes, the NL East champion Braves, who won 100-plus games each season and had the opening round off each time.
In fact, the teams with the five best regular-season records — the Braves, Baltimore (101 wins), Dodgers (100), Tampa Bay (99) and Milwaukee (92) — all failed last season to reach the LCS.
Could the short break derail Philadelphia’s championship run?
The Dodgers entered Tuesday at 93-63, just a half game ahead of Philadelphia’s 93-64 mark.
No. 1 would be fun but No. 2 is almost as good. The Phillies are almost assured of one of those positions, with the magic number for a top-two seed and a bye at two games over Milwaukee. Thanks to two clutch Matt Strahm strikeouts of Shohei Ohtani, the Phillies own the tiebreaker over the Dodgers, and would earn home-field advantage throughout the NL Championship Series if both teams had the same record.
Game 1 of the NL Wild Card Series is Oct. 1.
So let’s assume the Phillies get a No. 1 or No. 2 seed. Who’s next?
The wild-card race in the final week is a good one in the National League, with San Diego, Arizona and New York in the hunt, and with Atlanta making a late run at the Mets for the final spot.
The Phillies are 5-1 this season against the Padres; 3-4 against the Diamondbacks; 7-6 (including three losses last weekend in New York) against the Mets; and 6-7 against the Braves.
“Every time we walk out that door,” Schwarber said, “we expect to win a game.”
And maybe walk back in at the end of October with the coveted Commissioner’s Trophy, whether it starts with an F or not.

                Question: What is the value of the three-year contract that Klay Thompson signed with the Dallas Mavericks on October 1, 2024, in millions of dollars?

Publication date:2024-10-01 00:30:00

DALLAS (AP) — Kyrie Irving helped sell Klay Thompson on the idea that Dallas is a destination for a career revival.
Since Irving’s NBA rebirth helped carry the Mavericks to the NBA Finals last season, there’s little question what the addition of Thompson means for the club that lost to Boston in five games in June.
“I’m excited that he decided to come here,” Irving said at media day Monday. “And I feel like our dreams can be possible because he’s here now. He’s added some great value to our championship aspirations.”
Luka Doncic is still at the center of everything the Mavs do to build a contender around their 25-year-old superstar. Once again, the biggest move involves a veteran at a crossroads in an illustrious career.
That was Irving a year and a half ago in a trade deadline deal that plucked the eight-time All-Star from a tumultuous situation in Brooklyn.
Thompson hadn’t fallen nearly that far at the end of 13 seasons with the Golden State Warriors, who drafted him and won four championships with him and fellow Splash Brother Stephen Curry.
The 34-year-old sensed a change of scenery was the right play after a play-in tournament loss, and Dallas believes the presence of one of the game’s best shooters will make life easier for Doncic and Irving.
If nothing else, the aftermath of Doncic’s first trip to the finals is filled with talk of going that far again.


The conversation wasn’t quite the same when the Mavs made a surprising run to the Western Conference finals in 2022, losing to Thompson and the Warriors before Golden State’s fourth title.
“I love it because it means we did something great, something good,” Doncic said, correcting himself after earlier saying losing in the finals wasn’t good enough. “I think for the whole team, that should give us motivation.”
Thompson watched the Mavericks shoot 29% from 3-point range in their four losses to the Celtics in the finals. A 3-point threat — and third scoring threat — was clearly the biggest offseason priority.
“I think I’ll help space the floor for guys like Luka and Kyrie to do their thing,” Thompson said. “That’s why I was here in the first place, because I saw how close they were to winning a championship. The opportunity to do that again, I don’t take for granted, and I’m going to work my hardest to try to get us back there.”
The Mavericks missed the playoffs after the run to the West finals, despite adding Irving to a club that just never found a rhythm.
The first full season for Doncic and Irving led to the franchise’s first trip to the finals since its only championship in 2011.
There were plenty of questions along the way about Doncic and Irving getting their games to mesh, particularly during an injury-filled first two months together to finish a 2022-23 season that ended with the tanking of two games to protect a draft pick.
“Now, it’ll just be about Klay,” coach Jason Kidd said. “So that’s kind of cool that it’s just about one person.”
But not the only change to the roster.
Thompson joined the Mavericks in a sign-and-trade deal involving six teams and a $50 million, three-year contract for the five-time All-Star.
Dallas also added free agent forward Naji Marshall on a $27 million, three-year deal and acquired Quentin Grimes from Detroit in a trade that sent Tim Hardaway Jr. and three second-round picks to the Pistons.
The center tandem of second-year budding star Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford was an important part of the playoff run and will be something to watch alongside incorporating Thompson in the lineup.
“We have two superstars in Luka and Kyrie,” Thompson said. “But what I tell everyone on the squad, I’m like, ‘Guys, every championship experience I’ve had, it’s been a deep, talented roster.”
And the expectation will be a title.
“Expectations are extremely high, and I think everyone’s comfortable with that,” Kidd said. “We’re not going to run from expectations.”

Follow AP’s live coverage of Helene and the 2024 hurricane season.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — An enormous Hurricane Helene swamped parts of Mexico on Wednesday as it churned on a path forecasters said would take it to Florida as a potentially catastrophic storm with a surge that could swallow entire homes, a chilling warning that sent residents scrambling for higher ground, closed schools, and led to states of emergency throughout the Southeast.
Helene’s center was about 430 miles (735 kilometers) southwest of Tampa, Florida, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, and the hurricane was expected to intensify and accelerate as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico toward the Big Bend area of Florida’s northwestern coast. Landfall was expected sometime Thursday evening, and the hurricane center said by then it could be a major Category 4 storm with winds above 129 mph (208 kph). 
Tropical storm conditions were expected in southern Florida Wednesday night, spreading northward and encompassing the rest of Florida as well as Georgia and South Carolina through Thursday night. The storm was moving north at 12 mph (19 kph) with top sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) Wednesday evening. 


Helene could create a life-threatening storm surge as high as 20 feet (6.1 meters) in parts of the Big Bend region, forecasters said. Its tropical storm-force winds extended as far as 345 miles (555 kilometers) from its center.
The fast-moving storm’s wind and rain also could penetrate far inland: The hurricane center posted hurricane warnings well into Georgia and tropical storm warnings as far north as North Carolina, and it warned that much of the Southeast could experience prolonged power outages, toppled trees and dangerous flooding.


“Just hope and pray that everybody’s safe,” said Connie Dillard, of Tallahassee, as she shopped at a grocery store with thinning shelves of water and bread before hitting the highway out of town. “That’s all you can do.”
One insurance firm, Gallagher Re, is expecting billions of dollars in damage in the U.S. Around 18,000 linemen from out of state staged in Florida, ready to help restore power. Airports in St. Petersburg, Tallahassee and Tampa were planning to close on Thursday, and 62 hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities evacuated their residents Wednesday.
Georgia activated 250 National Guard soldiers for rapid deployment. State game wardens, foresters and Department of Correction teams will help provide swift-water rescues and other emergency responses.
State meteorologist Will Lanxton said tropical storm-force winds are expected throughout Georgia. Lanxton said metro Atlanta hasn’t seen sustained tropical storm winds since Hurricane Irma in 2017.
“I think we’re going to see some significant power outages, probably nothing like we’ve seen, because it’s 159 counties wide,” said James Stallings, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency.
In Tallahassee, where stations started to run out of gas, 19-year-old Florida A&M student Kameron Benjamin filled sandbags with his roommate to protect their apartment before evacuating. Their school and Florida State shut down.
Florida and Georgia are preparing for what could be a Category 3 hurricane. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.
“This hurricane is heading straight to Tallahassee, so I really don’t know what to expect,” Benjamin said. 
As Big Bend residents battened down their homes, many saw the ghost of 2018’s Hurricane Michael. That storm rapidly intensified and crashed ashore as a Category 5 that laid waste to Panama City and parts of the rural Panhandle. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service posted an urgent warning for residents along Apalachee Bay:
“There is a danger of catastrophic and unsurvivable storm surge for Apalachee Bay,” it said. “Storm surge may begin to arrive as early as late Wednesday night ahead of the winds. This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay. Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!”
“People are taking heed and hightailing it out of there for higher ground,” said Kristin Korinko, a Tallahassee resident who serves as the commodore of the Shell Point Sailboard Club, on the Gulf Coast about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Tallahassee.
For toughened Floridians who are used to hurricanes, Robbie Berg, a national warning coordinator for the hurricane center, advised: “Please do not compare it to other storms you may have experienced over the past year or two.”
Helene is forecast to be one of the largest storms in breadth in years to hit the region, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. He said since 1988, only three Gulf hurricanes were bigger than Helene’s predicted size: 2017’s Irma, 2005’s Wilma and 1995’s Opal.
Areas 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Georgia-Florida line can expect hurricane conditions. More than half of Georgia’s public school districts and several universities canceled classes. 
And for Atlanta, which is under a tropical storm watch, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd.
“It’s going to be a lot like Hugo in Charlotte,” Shepherd said of the 1989 storm that struck the North Carolina city, knocking out power to 85% of customers as winds gusted above hurricane force. 
Landslides were possible in southern Appalachia, with catastrophic flooding predicted in the Carolinas and Georgia, where all three governors declared emergencies. Rainfall is possible as far away as Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana.
Parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula were under hurricane warnings as Helene wound between it and the western tip of Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm formed Tuesday in the Caribbean, and it flooded streets and toppled trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort city of Cancun. 
In Cuba, authorities moved cattle to higher ground and medical brigades went to communities often cut off by storms. The government preventively shut off power in some communities as waves as high as 16 feet (5 meters) slammed Cortes Bay. In the Cayman Islands, schools remained closed as residents pumped water from flooded homes.
In the U.S., federal authorities positioned generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams. 
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that Helene could be as strong as a Category 4 hurricane when it makes landfall. The state was providing buses to evacuate people in the Big Bend region and taking them to shelters in Tallahassee. 
But near Florida’s center, outside Orlando, Walt Disney World said its only closures Thursday would be the Typhoon Lagoon water park and its miniature golf courses.
Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.
The Atlantic’s ninth named storm of the season Tropical Storm Isaac formed Wednesday night in the Atlantic Ocean. It was expected to strengthen as it moves eastward, possibly becoming a hurricane by the end of the week, forecasters said, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
In the Pacific, former Hurricane John reformed Wednesday as a tropical storm and was strengthening as it threatened areas of Mexico’s western coast. Officials posted hurricane warnings for southwestern Mexico.
John hit the country’s southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing at least two people, triggering mudslides, and damaging homes and trees. It grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours and made landfall east of Acapulco. It reemerged over the ocean after weakening inland.

GENOA, Italy (AP) — Genoa’s Serie A home match against Juventus will be played behind closed doors on Saturday, three days after crowd trouble before and after the Italian Cup derby.
Friday’s decision came after violent clashes between Genoa and Sampdoria fans that saw more than 50 people injured, including 41 police officers who were attempting to control the fiery crowds.
Most of the trouble happened after the match, which Serie B side Sampdoria won on penalties.
As punishment, no fans will be allowed into Genoa’s stadium on Saturday.
Sampdoria is expected to face a similar punishment for its next home match, against Juve Stabia on Oct. 4.

BEIRUT (AP) — The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings. 
At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon’s health ministry said. It was the biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year and appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.
The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams comb through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.
After the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel’s intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue — further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire. 
News of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing. 


Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings.
The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut’s Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon’s national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Beirut.
Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.
Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used, but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000-pound, American-made “Bunker Buster” guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets. 
Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb. 
Israel’s air forces followed with a new set of strikes early Saturday, also in the southern suburbs, shortly after warning residents of three buildings to evacuate. It said they were being used by Hezbollah to hide weapons, including anti-ship missiles. 
Israel’s military announced additional attacks on Beqaa in eastern Lebanon and Tyre in the south.
To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel spent the week pushing to eliminate Hezbollah’s senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah — successful or not — would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes. 
Nasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations. 
The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollah’s main headquarters, though it is located in the group’s “security quarters,” a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals.
Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was “in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.” 
The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman sustained mild shrapnel wounds.
Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said. 
The United Nations said the fighting has displaced 211,000 people, including 85,000 now staying in public schools and other shelters. Airstrikes have forced 20 primary health care centers to shut down and disrupted access to clean water for nearly 300,000 people. 
The scope of Israel’s operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.
At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to “continue degrading Hezbollah” until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal.
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border.
An Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the military’s goals are much narrower.
In Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas’ military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border — “not a high bar like Gaza” in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.
In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women — 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan — from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike. 
“That’s Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,” one man cried out as her body emerged.
Israel says its accelerated strikes have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah’s weapons capabilities and its fighters. A strike Tuesday in southern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy, Israel’s military said Saturday. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.
But Hezbollah boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities are unknown.
Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands gathered in another part of Beirut’s suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group’s drone unit, Mohammed Surour. 
People in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, “We will never accept humiliation,” as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group’s yellow flag. 
Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah’s top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza.
“We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,” Fadlallah said. “There is no place for neutrality in this battle.”

MOUNTAIN HOME VILLAGE, Calif. (AP) — As a raging wildfire continues to spread east of Los Angeles, driven by days of triple-digit temperatures, a teacher in an evacuation zone is planning to keep instructing online at his home in a Southern California mountain town.
Stephen Richardson, whose 1930s wooden cabin in the unincorporated community of Mountain Home Village is in the path of the Line Fire, said Monday he installed more fire-resistant siding to the structure and trimmed some branches away from his house.
“That’s about all I can do, aside from standing on the top of the roof with my garden hose, but that’s not in the plans,” said Richardson, a math and physics instructor at Platt College who planned to meet with his students online before deciding whether to leave the community where he was born and raised.
“If we’re seeing flames and the air gets bad, we’re probably going to head down,” he said.
Southern California mountain community residents like Richardson are mulling whether to stay and protect their homes or leave. Cal Fire spokesperson Rick Carhart said the fire led at least 6,000 people to evacuate.
“We’re dealing with triple-digit temperatures and hard-to-reach steep areas where there has not been fire in decades, or in recorded history, so all that vegetation has led to significant fuel loads,” Carhart said. 
Mara Rodriguez, a spokesperson with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, which issues evacuation orders, said nearly 5,000 homes fell under the existing orders and nearly 17,000 more were under evacuation warnings. 


The blaze threatened thousands of home and commercial structures as it burned along the edge of the San Bernardino National Forest, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Los Angeles. As of Monday evening, the blaze had charred about 37 square miles (96 square kilometers) of grass and brush and blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke. It was 5% contained. 
Meanwhile, firefighters were using bulldozers, helicopters and airplanes Monday to control another rapidly spreading blaze that broke out near a remote-controlled airplane airport in Orange County southeast of Los Angeles. The fire spread to about 3 square miles (7.8 square kilometers) in only a few hours.
In Northern California, a fire measuring less than a square mile (2.6 square kilometers) started Sunday and burned at least 30 homes and commercial buildings and destroyed 40 to 50 vehicles in Clearlake City, 110 miles (117 kilometers) north of San Francisco, officials said. Roughly 4,000 people were forced to evacuate by the Boyles Fire, which was about 40% contained Monday afternoon.
The fires are among the most dangerous of the many burning in various parts of California. 
About 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) outside Reno, Nevada, the uncontained Davis Fire grew to about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) after igniting Sunday afternoon. It originated in the Davis Creek Regional Park in the Washoe Valley and was burning in heavy timber and brush, firefighters said. 
An emergency declaration issued for Washoe County by Gov. Joe Lombardo on Sunday noted that about 20,000 people were evacuated from neighborhoods, businesses, parks and campgrounds. Parts of south Reno remained under the evacuation notice on Monday, firefighters said, and some homes, businesses and traffic signals in the area were without power.
The Southern California blaze burned so hot Saturday that it created its own thunderstorm-like weather systems of pyroculumus clouds, which can create more challenging conditions such as gusty winds and lightning strikes, according to the National Weather Service. 
The Reno fire is roughly 480 miles (770 kilometers) to the northeast of the blaze in the San Bernardino National Forest, where firefighters worked in steep terrain in temperatures above 100 degrees (38 Celsius), limiting their ability to control the blaze, officials said. State firefighters said three firefighters had been injured. 
Evacuations were ordered Saturday evening for Running Springs, Arrowbear Lake, areas east of Highway 330 and other regions. 
Running Springs resident Steven Michael King said he had planned to stay to fight the fire and help his neighbors until Sunday morning, when the fire escalated. He had prepped his house to prevent fire damage but decided to leave out of fear smoke could keep him from finding a way out later. 
“It came down to, which is worse, being trapped or being in a shelter?” King said outside an evacuation center Sunday. “When conditions changed, I had to make a quick decision, just a couple of packs and it all fits in a shopping cart.”
The affected area is near small mountain towns in the San Bernardino National Forest where Southern California residents ski in the winter and mountain bike in the summer. Running Springs is on the route to the popular ski resort town of Big Bear.
Redlands Unified School District cancelled Monday classes for roughly 20,000 students, and Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency for San Bernardino County. 
On Sunday, another blaze sparked amid searing heat in Southern California’s Angeles National Forest. The blaze burning north of the city of Glendora, in Los Angeles County, was about 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) and zero percent contained Monday evening. 
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department ordered visitors at a campground and residents of an adjacent river community to evacuate, the U.S. Forest Service said.
Wildfires were burning across the West, including in Idaho where fire managers were prepared for an active day, with warm, dry and windy conditions and even more challenging conditions Tuesday. The Boulder and the Lava Fires are burning in western Idaho.
In central Oregon, firefighters were dealing with a number of blazes that prompted evacuation warnings, including one west of Mount Bachelor on the Deschutes National Forest that was estimated around 80 acres (32.4 hectares) in size.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s governing party on Friday picked former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba as its leader, setting him up to become prime minister next week.
The party leadership is a ticket to the top job because the Liberal Democratic Party’s governing coalition controls parliament.
Considered a defense policy expert, Ishiba secured a come-from-behind win against Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who hoped to become the country’s first female prime minister.
AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on a new leader for Japan’s ruling party.
The LDP, which has enjoyed nearly unbroken rule since World War II, may have seen Ishiba’s more centrist views as crucial in pushing back challenges by the liberal-leaning opposition and winning voter support as the party reels from corruption scandals that drove down outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s popularity. 
After his victory was announced, Ishiba stood up, waved and bowed repeatedly and pledged to “devote all my body and soul” to regain public trust.

“We must be a party that allows members to discuss the truth freely, a party that is fair and impartial and a party that is humble,” he told a news conference later Friday. 
He stressed Japan needs to reinforce its security, noting recent violations of Japanese airspace by Russian and Chinese warplanes and repeated missile launches by North Korea.
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024
He pledged to continue Kishida’s economic policy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and achieving real salary increases, while tackling challenges such as Japan’s declining birthrate and population, as well as resilience in one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.


“I will achieve a society in which women and young people can have hope, hard-working people feel rewarded, and anyone can excel,” Ishiba said. 
He is expected to call a general election within weeks to capitalize on his win, but it is unclear when. He only said that he would seek the public’s mandate at an appropriate time after forming his new administration.
Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance, and said Friday that the idea is to form “an organic connection” of existing U.S.-led defense networks such as the ANZUS alliance with Australia and New Zealand and its alliances with South Korea and the Philippines. “We have to think how we can achieve peace and stability in this region,” he said.
He also suggested a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, and said having Japanese Self Defense Forces training bases in the United States would “contribute to the strengthening of the Japan-U.S. security alliance,” though he did not elaborate. 
He is a supporter of Taiwan’ s democracy. He also advocates the establishment of a disaster management agency in one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.
Ishiba, first elected to parliament in 1986, has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and was LDP secretary general under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

But he has long been viewed with wariness by powerful conservatives in his party. The 67-year-old former banker was running in the party leadership race for a fifth time and had said this was going to be his “final battle.” 
A hawk on defense issues, Ishiba has riled some party leaders by supporting measures to improve gaps between men and women and legalizing same-sex marriage. 
A record nine lawmakers, including two women, ran in the vote decided by LDP members of parliament and about 1 million dues-paying party members. That’s only 1% of the country’s eligible voters. 
Some experts believe that party turmoil could mean that Japan will return to an era similar to the early 2000s, which saw “revolving door” leadership changes and political instability.
A succession of short-lived governments hurts Japanese prime ministers’ ability to set up long-term policy goals or develop trusted relations with other leaders. 
On Tuesday, Kishida and his Cabinet ministers will resign. Ishiba, after being formally elected in a parliamentary vote, will then form a new Cabinet later in the day, he said.

Kishida congratulated Ishiba on his victory and said his election is the first step for a new LDP.
“The LDP will be reborn and will live up to the people’s expectations and achieve results,” he said. As Japan faces security tensions in the region and elsewhere, Japan must step up its own defense power and its ties with the United States, he said. 
South Korea, which has substantially improved ties with Japan over the past year in the face of an increasingly assertive China, said in a Foreign Ministry statement that it was looking forward to “continuing active exchanges with the new prime minister.” 
The main opposition group, the liberal-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, has struggled to build momentum despite the LDP scandals. Experts say its newly elected leader, centrist former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, is pushing a conservative shift for the party to attract swing voters.
Voters expressed hope that Ishiba would bring a positive change to politics.

“I think the LDP made a wise decision,” said Takeshi Irita, a 64-year-old engineer. “He is among the most realistic and stable ones and his mindset is relatively closer to the public.”
Hideko Arakawa, an 84-year-old retiree, said she has high expectations because of Ishiba’s expertise as a veteran lawmaker. “I hope he strives to make changes in Japan,” she said.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — San Francisco All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey missed the season opener against the New York Jets because of a sore calf and Achilles tendon that has hampered him all summer.
McCaffrey got hurt early in training camp and missed four weeks of practice before returning to the field last week. He was listed as questionable and said he expected to play Monday night. But he was a surprise scratch for the game.
“He didn’t have a setback. It was it was on and off throughout the week,” coach Kyle Shanahan said. “He was able to practice throughout the week. Just, it was always bothered him to a degree. Sometimes it goes away, sometimes it comes back. Today it was bothering a little too much to where we didn’t feel good about it.” 
Jordan Mason replaced McCaffrey and delivered 147 yards rushing and a touchdown on 28 carries in San Francisco’s 32-19 win.
Mason said in a television interview after the game that he was told on Friday he would start even though McCaffrey was listed as questionable for the game. But Shanahan said the decision wasn’t made until Monday.
Regardless, Mason made sure that McCaffrey’s absence wouldn’t prove costly.
“Not having Christian is huge, but we got a team that really commits to running the ball,” Shanahan said. “We got 10 guys out there who block for whoever the running back is. We got some running backs and some receivers who know how to lower their pads and run the ball too.”


McCaffrey led the NFL last season with 2,023 yards from scrimmage and was tied for the league lead with 21 touchdowns, winning AP Offensive Player of the Year.

San Francisco also activated All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams to the 53-man roster after his lengthy contract holdout. Brandon Parker was released to make room.
The Niners also promoted defensive end Sam Okuayinonu and safety Tracy Walker from the practice squad to play against the Jets. 
The other inactive players for San Francisco were defensive end Yetur Gross Matos (knee), safety Talanoa Hufanga (knee), linebacker Dee Winters (ankle), offensive lineman Ben Bartch and cornerback Darrell Luter. Joshua Dobbs was the emergency third quarterback. 
The Jets also made several roster moves Monday. They signed offensive lineman Jake Hanson and linebacker Sam Eguavoen to the active roster and placed linebacker Zaire Barnes on injured reserve. Tight end Anthony Firkser and defensive lineman Jalyn Holmes were promoted from the practice squad for the game. New York also signed running back Kene Nwangwu to the practice squad.
The inactive players for the Jets were offensive lineman Max Mitchell, running back Israel Abanikanda, tackler Carter Warren, tight end Brenden Bates, defensive lineman Eric Watts, defensive lineman Leonard Taylor and cornerback Jarrick Bernard-Converse.

Federal agents on Wednesday took devices from Adams’ police commissioner, his schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and several other advisers.
None of the officials involved have been charged with a crime, but the wave of searches added to a cloud of suspicion around Adams, a former city police captain who has fashioned himself as a champion of law and order.
They’ve also raised questions internally about the administration’s ability to stay focused on serving the nation’s largest city.
In a private call Friday with senior staff, the city’s Emergency Management Commissioner, Zach Iscol, offered a blunt assessment of the impact of the investigations on public safety.
“This is not good,” he said, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by The Associated Press. “There’s a lot going on in the city and the thing that I’m most concerned about is city leadership being distracted.“
The agency, which is responsible for the city’s emergency procedures, falls under the portfolio of Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Philip Banks, whose home was visited by law enforcement Wednesday. Iscol said on the call that he had not spoken to City Hall leadership as of Friday morning.


The FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment and it was not immediately clear whether federal authorities were seeking information linked to one investigation or several.
In addition to Banks, federal agents on Wednesday seized devices from Police Commissioner Edward Caban; First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright; Banks’ brother, David Banks, the city’s schools chancellor; and Timothy Pearson, a top mayoral adviser and former high-ranking New York Police Department official.
The seizures came nearly a year after federal agents seized Adams’ phones and iPad as he was leaving an event in Manhattan. Investigators also searched the homes of a top Adams campaign fundraiser and a member of his administration’s international affairs office.
In February, federal authorities searched two properties belonging to his director of Asian affairs as part of a separate investigation overseen by the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn.
Then earlier this summer, Adams, his campaign and City Hall all received subpoenas from federal prosecutors requesting information about the mayor’s overseas travel and potential connections to the Turkish government.
The most recent round of searches appear to be unrelated to the Turkey inquiry and the investigation by Brooklyn federal prosecutors, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose information about the investigations.
“There is a stench of corruption around the mayor,” said Douglas Muzzio, a retired political science professor at Baruch College with deep knowledge of New York politics. “You’ve got to believe that at some point, the feeling that the government is not working is going to start pervading the public consciousness.” 
Federal investigators appear to have been interested in Adams’ inner circle as far back as this winter. John Scola, an attorney representing four city employees who have accused Pearson of sexual harassment, said three of his clients received visits in February from FBI agents, who wanted to know about Pearson and his work with City Hall.
Pearson previously worked alongside Phil Banks before he was assigned to lead a new mayoral unit tasked with overseeing city agencies.
Those who worked with Pearson said he had an unusual suite of responsibilities that gave him wide latitude over police promotions, pandemic recovery efforts and certain homeless shelters for migrants. He is currently facing a separate city investigation for his role in a brawl at one of those shelters.
Throughout the various FBI activities, Adams has forcefully maintained that he has followed the law and that he would continue to focus on his duties as mayor.
Asked repeatedly at news conferences about the investigations, Adams has said his mantra is to “stay focused, no distractions and grind.”
Fabien Levy, a spokesperson for the mayor, said nothing would hamper the administration’s ability to govern.
“For the better part of a year, the mayor has been absolutely clear that, as a former member of law enforcement, he will always follow the law, and in the same time he has stayed focused on delivering for the people of the city,” Levy said in a statement Friday, pointing to recent drops in crime and increases in job numbers and other city initiatives. 
Since the Wednesday morning searches, the mayor has personally visited a tunnel emergency, held a public event about the first day of school, and met with residents concerned about e-bikes. On Friday, he held his regularly scheduled senior staff call at 8 a.m., then met with the mayor of Lisbon, Levy said. 
In a statement, Schools Chancellor David Banks said: “I remain focused on ensuring they have safe, academically rigorous, and a joyful school year. I am confirming that I am cooperating with a federal inquiry. At this time, I cannot comment any further on that matter.”
Benjamin Brafman, an attorney for Philip Banks, confirmed that a search was conducted, but otherwise declined to comment. The NYPD’s media relations office also confirmed a federal investigation involving members of the department, but declined to make Caban available for comment. A phone message left for Pearson’s attorney was not returned.
But news of the latest investigations has provided Adams’ foes with fresh and potent lines of attack ahead of what is expected to be a heavily contested primary election season for the Democratic mayor. 
Brad Lander, a Democrat who serves as the city’s comptroller and is one of a handful of challengers to Adams in next year’s primary, said the fact that investigations are swirling around much of the mayor’s top staff could create “a level of both distraction and anxiety about trustworthiness and consequences for all New Yorkers.”
“New Yorkers want to know their leaders are focused on their problems and not their own problems, and the staff of agencies also need focused leadership helping them confront the challenges New Yorkers have,” Lander said. 
Scott Stringer, a former city comptroller who is expected to run against Adams next year, said the investigations are becoming a serious impediment to the day-to-day process of governing. 
“We New Yorkers are not stupid,” he said. “We know that this government is paralyzed by the investigation. I think the mayor needs to step up and tell New Yorkers, in a real way, everything he knows about what’s going on.”",False

Publication date:2024-09-13 07:00:00

Russia on Friday accused six British diplomats of spying and said it decided to expel them. The U.K. said the “completely baseless” move came weeks ago and was linked to its action in May to revoke the credentials of an attaché at the Russian Embassy and limit Moscow’s diplomatic activities in London.
The latest East-West tensions unfolded as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits Washington for talks that will include Ukraine’s request to use Western-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia. President Vladimir Putin has warned that Kyiv’s use of long-range weapons would put NATO at war with Moscow.
Russia’s Federal Security Service said in an online statement that the Foreign Ministry withdrew the British envoys’ accreditations, and Russian TV quoted an FSB official as saying it was decided to expel them.
The FSB said it received documents indicating the diplomats were sent to Russia by a division of the U.K.'s Foreign Office “whose main task is to inflict a strategic defeat on our country,” and that they were involved in “intelligence-gathering and subversive activities.” It did not identify the six diplomats.
The FSB warned that if other diplomats are found to be carrying out “similar actions,” it “will demand early termination of their missions” to Russia.
Russian TV said the six diplomats had met with independent media and rights groups that have been declared “foreign agents” — a label Russian authorities have actively used against organizations and individuals critical of the Kremlin.


Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in a statement that the diplomats were carrying out “subversive actions aimed at causing harm to our people.”
“We fully agree with the assessments of the activities of the British so-called diplomats expressed by the Russian FSB,” she added in an online statement. “The British Embassy has gone far beyond the limits outlined by the Vienna Conventions.”
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said breaking off diplomatic relations with the U.K. was not on the table right now. 
In calling the Russian allegations “completely baseless,” the U.K. Foreign Office said the expulsions happened weeks ago, linking them to Britain’s decision in May to revoke the credentials of an attaché at Moscow’s London embassy and to impose a five-year time limit on all Russian diplomats in Britain. 
“The Russian authorities revoked the diplomatic accreditation of six U.K. diplomats in Russia last month, following action taken by the U.K. government in response to Russian state-directed activity across Europe and in the U.K.,” the Foreign Office said in a statement. “We are unapologetic about protecting our national interests.”
In May, the U.K. expelled Russia’s defense attaché in London, alleging he was an undeclared intelligence officer, and it closed several Russian diplomatic properties in Britain that it said were being used for spying. About a week later, Russia reciprocated and expelled Britain’s defense attaché. 
Expulsions of diplomats — both Western envoys working in Russia and Russians in the West — have become increasingly common since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 
Last year, the Russian news outlet RBC counted that Western countries and Japan expelled a total 670 Russian diplomats between the start of 2022 and October 2023, while Moscow responded by expelling 346 diplomats. According to RBC, that was more than in the previous 20 years combined.
On his way to visit the U.S., Starmer said Britain does not “seek any conflict with Russia.”
“Russia started this conflict. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine. Russia could end this conflict straight away,” he told reporters.
“Ukraine has the right to self-defense and we’ve obviously been absolutely fully supportive of Ukraine’s right to self-defense — we’re providing training capability, as you know. But we don’t seek any conflict with Russia — that’s not our intention in the slightest,” he said.
Ukraine wants approval to use some weapons to strike deeper into Russia and there are signs that President Joe Biden might shift U.S. policy in response.
While the issue is expected to be at the top of the agenda for their meeting, it appeared unlikely that Biden and Starmer would announce any policy changes at this time, according to two U.S. officials familiar with planning for the talks. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private deliberations.
Ukrainian officials renewed their pleas to use Western-provided long-range missiles against targets deeper inside Russia during this week’s visit to Kyiv by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy. 
Blinken said he had “no doubt” that Biden and Starmer would discuss the matter during their visit, noting the U.S. has adapted and “will adjust as necessary” as Russia’s battlefield strategy has changed.

Publication date:2024-09-01 07:00:00

NEW YORK (AP) — A point away from losing the second set with his opponent serving, Frances Tiafoe looked at a positive.
At least, he figured, he would be able to change out of his sweaty shirt and sneakers.
A couple minutes later, he hadn’t changed his clothes. He had changed around the match.
Tiafoe rallied to steal the second set and went on to earn his way back to the U.S. Open quarterfinals for the third straight year, beating Alexei Popyrin 6-4, 7-6 (3), 2-6, 6-3 on Sunday night.
“I think the second set was a huge, huge win for me,” Tiafoe said. “You know, 5-3, 40-love, him serving, how good he serves, that was really, really big. To break there and then to win that set was huge.”
The No. 20 seed will attempt to match the best Grand Slam result of his career when he faces No. 9 Grigor Dimitrov on Tuesday for a berth in the semifinals. 
Tiafoe lost to eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz in that round in 2022, and was eliminated last year in the quarterfinals by Ben Shelton.
Tiafoe is the first American man to reach three consecutive U.S. Open quarterfinals since Andy Roddick from 2006-08. Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi are the only other American men since 2000 to reach the final eight in New York three straight times. 
All that after what had been a pretty poor first half of the season before Tiafoe heated up on the hard-court swing leading into the U.S. Open.


“Everything is happening when it’s meant to happen,” Tiafoe said. “I’m glad it’s happening now because this is the most important time for me.”
He turned the match late in the second set, when Popyrin was serving with a 5-3 lead and a chance to even it at a set apiece. Tiafoe won the next five points to break, and quickly took control of the tiebreaker by jumping to a 4-1 lead. 
Popyrin, the No. 28 seed from Australia, upset defending champion Novak Djokovic on Friday to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time. But he believed he might have gone further had he put away the second set.
“Definitely a lost opportunity,” Popyrin said. “I’ve been saying all week that I think against these top players you have to take your chances when you have them. Obviously 5-3, 40-Love up serving, it’s a really big choke from my end.”
No. 12 seed Taylor Fritz won earlier Sunday and another American, Tommy Paul, will play No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner of Italy in the fourth round Monday. Should Paul win that, he would join Tiafoe and Fritz to give the U.S. three men in the quarterfinals at Flushing Meadows for the second consecutive year.
The last time there were that many players from the host country in the U.S. Open men’s quarterfinals twice in a row was in 2001 and 2002.

Publication date:2024-09-30 22:33:00

BOSTON (AP) — Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre filed a lawsuit Monday against a U.S. Senate committee that pursued contempt charges against him for failing to appear before the panel despite being issued a subpoena. 
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, named nearly all members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who chairs the committee which has investigated Steward’s bankruptcy. 
The lawsuit claims that the lawmakers are unlawfully violating de la Torre’s constitutional rights.
It alleges that the members of the committee, by trying to compel de la Torre to answer questions about Steward’s bankruptcy, are “collectively undertaking a concerted effort to punish Dr. de la Torre for invoking his Fifth Amendment right not to ‘be compelled . . . to be a witness against himself.’”
De la Torre is asking the court to declare that all actions related to enforcement of the subpoena are invalid and unconstitutional — including the vote of the committee on Sept. 19 approving the criminal contempt resolution and its decision to present the resolution to the full Senate for a vote. 
The Senate approved the resolution last week.
“No one can be compelled to testify when they exercise this right under these circumstances. Nor does the Constitution permit Congress to punish and intimidate him, or any other American, for exercising these rights,” William “Bill” Burck, a lawyer for de la Torre, said in a statement.


Anna Bahr, communications director for Sanders, dismissed the lawsuit.
“Democrats and Republicans on the HELP Committee came together and unanimously voted to hold Dr. de la Torre in contempt of Congress, as did the entire U.S. Senate,” she said in a statement. “This case has no merit.”
The lawsuit comes a day before de la Torre is set to step down as CEO of Steward.
De la Torre has overseen Steward’s network of some 30 hospitals around the country. The Texas-based company’s troubled recent history has drawn scrutiny from elected officials in New England, where some of its hospitals are located.
A spokesperson for de la Torre said Saturday that he “has amicably separated from Steward on mutually agreeable terms” and “will continue to be a tireless advocate for the improvement of reimbursement rates for the underprivileged patient population.”
Sanders said earlier this month that Congress “will hold Dr. de la Torre accountable for his greed and for the damage he has caused to hospitals and patients throughout America.” 
Steward has shut down pediatric wards in Massachusetts and Louisiana, closed neonatal units in Florida and Texas, and eliminated maternity services at a hospital in Florida.
Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts said that over the past decade, Steward, led by de la Torre, and its corporate enablers, “looted hospitals across the country for profit, and got rich through their greedy schemes.”
Alexander Merton, an attorney for de la Torre, has said the fault instead lies with “the systemic failures in Massachusetts’ health care system” and that the committee was trying to frame de la Torre as a criminal scapegoat. Merton has also said that de la Torre would agree to testify at a later date.
On Friday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey announced her administration had formally seized a hospital through eminent domain to help keep it open and transition to a new owner. St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Boston was one of a group run by Steward. Operations will be transferred to Boston Medical Center.

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — At least 14 people have died and 176 others injured in Vietnam after Typhoon Yagi slammed the country’s north, state media said Sunday, as officials warned of heavy downpours despite its waning power. 
Described by Vietnamese officials as one of the most powerful typhoons to hit the region over the last decade, Yagi left more than 3 million people without electricity in northern Vietnam. It also damaged vital agricultural land, nearly 116,192 hectares where rice and fruits are mostly grown. Hundreds of flights were canceled after four airports were closed. 
The typhoon made landfall in Vietnam’s northern coastal provinces of Quang Ninh and Haiphong with wind speeds of up to 149 kilometers per hour (92 miles per hour) on Saturday afternoon. It raged for roughly 15 hours before gradually weakening into a tropical depression early Sunday morning. Vietnam’s meteorological department predicted heavy rain in northern and central provinces and warned of floods in low-lying areas, flash floods in streams and landslides on steep slopes.
Municipal workers along with army and police forces were busy in the capital, Hanoi, clearing uprooted trees, fallen billboards, toppled electricity poles and rooftops that were swept away, while assessing damaged buildings.
Yagi was still a storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people dead and 26 others missing mostly in landslides and widespread flooding in the acrchipelago nation. It then made its way to China, killing three people and injuring nearly a hundred others, before landing in Vietnam. 
Storms like Typhoon Yagi were “getting stronger due to climate change, primarily because warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel the storms, leading to increased wind speeds and heavier rainfall,” said Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.",False

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A small boat carrying migrants from nearby Turkey sank Monday in wind-tossed waters in the eastern Aegean Sea just off the island of Samos, killing at least four people, Greek authorities said.
The bodies of three women and a girl were found in the water. The coast guard said five others were rescued from the sea, and another 26 who safely made it to shore were later found on land.
A large search and rescue operation by air, land and sea remained in effect because survivors said it was possible one or two people might still be missing.
Authorities were initially alerted by a local resident who heard screams and cries for help from the sea, local officials said. 
It wasn’t immediately known how the boat, believed to have been a small dinghy, sank, and there was no immediate information on the identities or nationalities of the survivors and the dead.
Sonia Balleron, the head of the Greece mission for the international medical charity Doctors Without Borders, said the group was “shocked and outraged” by the sinking and was providing emergency support to the survivors.
“These deaths are the tragic consequence of inhumane migration policies,” Balleron said in a statement. Human rights groups accuse European authorities of failing to provide legal migration paths for people seeking a better life on the continent.
Greece lies along one of the most popular routes into the European Union for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Despite a crackdown by Greek authorities along the land and sea border with Turkey, thousands of people make it across, often from the Turkish coast to Greek islands using flimsy inflatable dinghies.
In recent months, smugglers have also increasingly turned to ferrying migrants in powerful speedboats.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard showed his teammates what he was all about with an early scramble and a subsequent slide that drew a first-quarter targeting penalty on Texas A&M defensive back Dalton Brooks last weekend.
Leonard got up, dusted himself off and went right back to work — a business-as-usual moment that struck a chord on the Fighting Irish sideline.
“Taking a hit like he did, the targeting penalty, a lot of people would have been shaken up by that,” wide receiver Beaux Collins said. “They would have been rattled and thrown off. I felt he was poised the whole game. I didn’t see any type of worry, no type of doubt in his eyes.”
Neither did anyone else, which was a key reason coach Marcus Freeman pursued Leonard when he entered the transfer portal.
That decision already is paying dividends at Notre Dame, which moved up two spots to No. 5 in the AP Top 25 after a 23-13 victory over the then-No. 20 Aggies. Leonard threw 18 of 30 for 158 yards and ran 12 times for 63 yards.
On Saturday, he gets to do it all over again when the Irish (1-0) face Mid-American Conference opponent Northern Illinois (1-0). And after being a two-year starter at Duke, the veteran doesn’t expect any butterflies when he plays in one of college football’s most revered venues, Notre Dame Stadium.
“As the game builds up, I become more and more emotionless, because I’m more confident,” Leonard said. “Nerves come with lack of preparation. Everybody that comes to Notre Dame has a goal and a legitimate chance to go to the NFL. Everybody here is like, ‘Hey, can we watch film; hey, what do you think about this?’”


The 6-foot-4, 216-pound former Alabama prep star certainly knows about the mystique of Irish football, everything from Knute Rockne to “Rudy.” And he was part of a new chapter last season when he suffered a high sprain of his right ankle late in Duke’s 21-14 loss to Notre Dame.
Irish quarterback Sam Hartman, who played previously at Wake Forest, waited outside the injury tent after the game ended to check on Leonard. Leonard emerged on crutches, and the two briefly chatted.
Whether that influenced Leonard’s eventual decision to join the Irish this season isn’t clear. Leonard has said he chose Notre Dame because of the camaraderie he found among the players. The last few months have only confirmed his initial impression.
“We’ll be sitting in the locker room drawing up plays,” Leonard said. “When you see somebody in the facility late at night, watching film, that’s just going to drive you to go later than him and watch more film than him. That’s the atmosphere and the culture here.”
It shows with the dual-threat quarterback’s unusual leadership style.
“He’s kind of like a chill dude at all times throughout the game,” Collins said. “I didn’t know what to expect from him. He’s definitely the leader that we needed.”
Leonard brings an experienced hand, too.
He was 250 of 392 passing with 2,967 yards, 20 TDs and six interceptions during his first season as Duke’s starter but was limited by injuries last season. He threw 95 of 165 for 1,102 yards and three TDs while rushing 124 times for 699 yards and 13 scores before a season-ending left toe injury in late October.
But it’s not just what he does on the field that makes him special.
His penchant for learning has helped him thrive in Notre Dame’s offensive system and lead the team in front of a rocking, raucous 107,000 fans at Texas A&M, too.
“He picks things up fast,” Notre Dame offensive coordinator Mike Denbrock said. “I think he’s a guy who seeks details. He wants detailed information. He wants detailed feedback, whether that’s positive or negative, so he can go and learn as a player.”
But as gritty as Leonard’s start was last weekend, his finishing kick also turned heads around South Bend, giving the Irish and their fans a glimpse of how promising this season could be with Leonard behind center.
“To finish the fourth quarter with an eight-play, 85-yard TD drive that was the difference,” Freeman said. “That’s really the moment where we were able to say: ‘We have this. We’ve got the game.’”

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea announced plans Thursday to compensate farmers and others in the country’s dwindling dog meat industry before a formal ban goes into effect in 2027, a move that is drawing opposition from both farmers and some animal rights activists. 
South Korea’s parliament passed a landmark bill in January that will ban slaughtering, breeding or selling dog meat for human consumption after a three-year grace period. It will be punishable by 2-3 years in prison. 
The Agriculture Ministry said that farmers would receive compensation starting from 225,000 won ($170), and rising up to 600,000 won ($450) per dog if they agree to shut down their businesses early.
An association of farmers rejected the offer, saying in a statement that they cannot relinquish their dogs for such low prices. Farmers earlier called for 2 million won ($1,505) per dog. They’ve said the ban infringes on their right to choose their own jobs and will aggravate their economic difficulties.
The association said that farmers will keep fighting even if they end up being jailed. Earlier in the week, they called for the law to be amended to extend the grace period and add appropriate compensation plans.
Sangkyung Lee, a campaign manager at the Korean office of the anti-animal cruelty group Humane Society International, called the South Korean announcement “an important milestone in this historic ban that will see the ban through to completion and end our country’s dog meat era for good.” 


But Lee said his office is disappointed at the South Korean plan because it would pay farmers based on the number of dogs they have, “potentially increasing dog breeding to get more money from the scheme and more puppies being born into suffering.” 
The Korean Animal Welfare Association, a Seoul-based animal rights group, said that local governments must strictly monitor farms to prevent them from increasing their number of dogs through breeding. It praised the government for trying to take reasonable steps to phase out the industry but criticized farmers for seeking excessive compensation. 
Dog meat consumption is a centuries-old practice on the Korean Peninsula. It’s also eaten in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and some African countries. But South Korea’s dog meat industry has drawn more attention because of the country’s reputation as a cultural and economic powerhouse. It’s also the only nation with industrial-scale dog farms.

South Korea’s anti-dog meat campaign received a big boost from the country’s first lady, Kim Keon Hee, who repeatedly expressed her support for a prohibition. She was subjected to withering criticism and crude insults during demonstrations by farmers.
Surveys have found that around one in three South Koreans opposes the ban, though most people now don’t eat dog meat.
Vice Agriculture Minister Park Beomsu told reporters that government studies found that about 466,000 dogs are currently being raised for food across South Korea. He said officials will try to convince farmers to voluntarily phase out dog breeding ahead of the ban. 
After the ban comes into force, Park said, the government plans to facilitate adoptions for the remaining dogs or move them to care facilities rather than euthanize them. 
The agriculture ministry said butchers will also be compensated, while local authorities will be responsible for dismantling dog farms and slaughterhouses. Former farmers and butchers will also get low-interests loans if they pivot to other agricultural businesses. 
The ministry said authorities will also offer financial assistance to traders and restaurant owners to shut down their businesses and find new jobs.",False

HALLE, Belgium (AP) — The congregation at the Don Bosco church solemnly took the holy host after it was blessed during a Sunday service by Nancy Speeckaert — a woman. Only a week earlier, to equal excitement, she had also blessed a wedding. 
On both occasions, the humble neighborhood church was filled to near capacity with generations of joyous faithful. And if a key tenet of Catholic doctrine was breached by a woman celebrating the sacrament, it was all covered by a coat of religious love. 
Two miles southwest, in the center of the same town of 44,000 near Brussels, less than half of Halle’s big Saint Martin’s Basilica was filled for Sunday’s main Mass, where within minutes of the liturgy starting, words about guilt and calls of “go away, Satan” echoed among the stone pillars. 
Pope Francis will be visiting Belgium from Thursday to Sunday, facing a flock ravaged by countless scandals of priest sexual abuse and dwindling in the face of modernity, where women and gay people insist on an equal role and rights. 
For years now, progressive Don Bosco had increasingly sought its own way and in March, the Flemish Brabant Mechelen vicarship said it could no longer function as a Catholic parish “partly because of the different views on the celebration of the sacraments.” The Catholic leadership, however, allowed the Don Bosco community to continue its activities in the church as it prepares to become “an independent religious community.”
“They were coloring outside the lines,” admonished the Rev. Guy De Keersmaecker, the Catholic priest working beyond retirement age to take on the more orthodox but dwindling Saint Martin’s parish. “Come on. In our church, we do have something like a constitution.” 


At Don Bosco, the community feels it needs fixing, countered Speeckaert. “We have a lawyer in our group who said a constitution may have been written once, but we always must consider whether it needs change to improve society and the world,” she said.
Coming off a trip to sweltering Southeast Asia, where churches are full and Francis drew record-setting crowds, a European homecoming in this once overwhelmingly Catholic nation, where some churches have now turned into sports clubs or fashion shops, might feel a lot colder for Francis. 
In the back of Don Bosco, retired priest Rik Deville is still a regular in the parish he molded, decades after he decried the Catholic Church in his 1992 book “The Last Dictatorship.” 
With his call for “a parish without a pope” he reaped a whirlwind of criticism from bishops, right up to the Vatican. To his amazement though, he had broken through another barrier. People started calling him up, and broke down over the phone reliving long-suppressed memories of sexual abuse and rape by priests and clergy. “One person after another, and then another — and then another,” he remembers. 
He became a torchbearer for those victims. What had often been rumors of rampant abuse gained credibility in a groundswell of scandal that engulfed priests, bishops the nation’s cardinal who was once tipped as a papal candidate. Each time the abuse and cover-up proved more deep-seated than previously thought, a pattern seen across many of Europe’s most devout nations like Ireland, Spain and Poland. 
Within his Human Rights in the Church group alone, “we wrote around the year 2000 that we had a lot of files — 84 — and I thought it was a lot. Now we are running up to 2,000, some 1,950 children that have been abused in this little speck of land,” he said. 
“At first, I went to the cardinal,” said Deville. “Nothing happened. He knew nothing. Could do nothing. Or wrote: ‘I prayed for you.’” 
When Bruges Bishop Roger Vangheluwe admitted with little apparent remorse in 2010 that he had sexually abused his nephew, the Vatican imposed no stern punishment. Pope Francis only defrocked him earlier this year — 14 years later — in a move widely seen as a bid to stem criticism ahead of his visit.
The pope will be meeting with abuse victims in private during his trip. But Deville said he has seen how a small number are being handpicked, expecting they will not cause a stir. “The pope has been in so many nations where there has been a clamor over sexual abuse — Ireland, Canada and others. Each time, here too, he will address victims, a tap on the shoulder. We will pray for you. A rosary as gift,” Deville said. “The pope will get on the plane and the file will remain as is.” 
During all those years, church attendance sank throughout most of Europe and Belgium — certainly in Saint Martin’s, where a decades-long renovation restored the splendor of stone but hardly filled the pews. Priest De Keersmaecker knows what is wrong. 
“The situation is totally changed now. We have had the whole sexual abuse scandal and the Vangheluwe case,” he said. “It has left deep scars in our church.” 
Yet, unlike Deville, he is sticking with the Vatican, Pope Francis and with Mass celebrations that easily fill pensioners with memories of their youth. “The pope is someone who doesn’t let go of the core of our religion. So, yes, careful — careful he is as the captain of the ship of the church which is going through rough waters.” 
These days only 8.9% of Belgians go to Mass at least once a month. No figures for weekly attendance, so long the standard, were immediately available. 
De Keersmaecker said he would like to see more progressive elements, including for women, but Europe is held back by others. 
“It is something that needs to be looked at. We are within a global church and there are regions and continents where it is still not thought possible,” he said, calling for “loyalty with the wider Catholic community,” which Don Bosco refused to show. 
Speeckaert was only drawn into an ever bigger role at Don Bosco because when Deville retired in 2009, there simply was no one to replace him. Since the days when every parish had its priest, Belgium is increasingly hard-pressed to find men who want to be priests. In a nation of 11 million, only 9 were ordained as priests in 2022. 
Don Bosco took it step by step, literally putting on paper how it wanted to celebrate Mass. “We practiced behind closed doors how to do it all,” said Speeckaert. And gradually, commitments and involvement grew until suddenly it included women celebrating the sacraments. 
“I never had the feeling that I was passing over a threshold because it all came gradually,” she said. 
For church authorities, action came late, long after they seemed to accommodate the wayward parish. Speeckaert said they might have brought on their own expulsion when they started confronting church authorities. “We felt a more strict line was coming and that a number of things amounted to infringements on human rights.” 
With the expulsion as a parish, which is to be complete by the end of next year, Don Bosco said it will miss out on 60,000 euros of funds a year while it remains unclear exactly what they can do with the church building. 
Speeckaert hoped it could have been different. “I am rather naive and believe in the kindness of people and thought: Come on, they will dare to do it! And they didn’t,” she said. “It hit me hard.”
There will be a service in Don Bosco — with a woman presiding — at the very minute Pope Francis holds mass for 35,000 at the King Baudouin stadium Sept. 29. If the pope draws some faithful away, Speeckaert won’t mind. “It is not because people think more conservatively that we cannot deal with it.”
“Everyone can do their own thing in their own way.”",False

SYDNEY (AP) — Football Australia has appointed former Asian Champions League winning manager Tony Popovic as the new head coach of the Australian men’s team until the end of the 2026 World Cup. 
Popovic, 51, replaces Graham Arnold, who stepped down last week after an indifferent start to the Socceroos’ World Cup qualification in the Asia zone.
“I am extremely honoured to be given this opportunity to lead the Socceroos as head coach,” Popovic said in a statement on Monday. “It’s a role that comes with great responsibility, and I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity.
“To be entrusted with guiding our national team is a privilege that I do not take lightly.
Popovic is best known for guiding the Western Sydney Wanderers to the Asian Champions League title in 2014, and has also had successful stints with the Perth Glory and Melbourne Victory in Australia’s A-League.
Earlier in his career, Popovic had stints as an assistant at Crystal Palace and coached at clubs in Turkey and Greece.
Popovic, who won 58 caps for Australia as a defender, decided not to renew his contract with the Victory for the upcoming A-League season making his immediate appointment to the Socceroos post possible and timely with vital home World Cup qualifiers against China on Oct. 10, followed by a trip to Japan five days later.
Australia are winless through their first two games of the third stage of qualifiers, after a shock loss to Bahrain at home and a dour 0-0 draw away to Indonesia.


“We have moved swiftly to secure the best possible candidate for this crucial role,” said FA chief executive James Johnson. “Our prompt action reflects our commitment to maintaining the momentum and success of the Socceroos program, especially as we are at the beginning of the critical third round of AFC Asian qualifiers.”

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A powerful typhoon was lashing the northernmost islands of the Philippines Monday, prompting officials to evacuate villagers, shut down schools and inter-island ferries and warn of “potentially very destructive” damage to coastal villages.
Typhoon Krathon was last tracked over the coastal waters of Balintang island off the provinces of Cagayan and Batanes with sustained winds of up to 175 kph (109 mph) and gusts of up to 215 kph (133 mph), according to government forecasters.
The slow-moving Krathon was blowing westward and could strengthen into a super typhoon when it veers northeastward Tuesday toward Taiwan, they said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage
Guilmar Cabejo, a police officer on the island of Sabtang in typhoon-prone Batanes, said the streets were deserted in the town of more than 1,800 people as the ferocious wind rattled roofs, walls and trees.
“There’s nobody outside, zero, because the wind is so strong,” Cabejo told The Associated Press by cellphone. “Nobody could stand normally outside in this wind, it will force anybody down to the ground.”
Residents, locally renowned for their resilience against seasonal storms, strengthened their roofs with ropes, covered windows with wooden boards and secured their fishing boats away from the sea two days before the typhoon hit, he said.
The weather agency warned of “moderate to high risk of life-threatening storm surge” in the next 48 hours in the coastal villages of Batanes, the nearby Babuyan islands and Cagayan province and said fierce winds could rip off roofs, topple trees, damage farmlands and whip up high waves.


“The situation is potentially very destructive to the community,” it said.
Hundreds of villagers were evacuated away from the coast and flood-prone communities in Cagayan province, where power outages were reported. Classes in all levels were suspended Monday in several northern provinces as a precaution, officials said.

Sea voyages were also halted in northern towns and provinces being battered or threatened by the typhoon, locally called Julian, officials said.
About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago also lies in the “Pacific Ring of Fire,” a region along most of the Pacific Ocean rim where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur, making the Southeast Asian nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone.
In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in the world, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.",False

NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Tennessee coach Josh Heupel won in his return to Oklahoma — the same school he quarterbacked to a national championship in 2000 and fired him as offensive coordinator after the 2014 season — as Nico Iamaleava passed for 194 yards to help the sixth-ranked Volunteers defeat the Sooners 25-15 on Saturday night.
Iamaleava took the game ball to Heupel shortly after the game ended.
“I know it meant a lot to him,” Iamaleava said. “He didn’t show it as much during the week, but we know what it meant to him and what it meant to us.”
Heupel downplayed the circumstances, instead focusing on his team’s success.
“This game was never about me coming back here, not for this football team,” he said. “And I say all that — they also understood that this one was a little bit different for me personally too, but that’s not what it was about. But I do appreciate their recognition of that and wanting that for me.”
Oklahoma coach Brent Venables was the defensive coordinator on the team Heupel led to the national title. He said it was a tough loss. 
“I’m disappointed in our team tonight,” Venables said. “It’s not one of those moments where you’re happy for him (Heupel) because you’re not. But that just kind of comes with the territory.”
Dylan Sampson ran for 92 yards and a touchdown, Dont’e Thornton Jr. had a 66-yard touchdown reception and Bru McCoy had four catches for 92 yards for the Volunteers.


Tennessee (4-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) held No. 15 Oklahoma to 222 yards in the Sooners’ first-ever SEC game.
It wasn’t the up-tempo style one might expect from a Heupel-coached team. Tennessee had the ball for nearly 36 minutes and rode its defense.
“Your team forms its own identity each year, and it’s my responsibility to put them in a position to play a complete game together and find the best way to win,” he said. “And tonight, that’s how the game unfolded.”
Jovantae Barnes ran for a score and caught a touchdown pass for Oklahoma (3-1, 0-1). Michael Hawkins Jr. passed for 132 yards in relief of starter Jackson Arnold for the Sooners, who was benched late in the second quarter after completing 7 of 16 passes for 54 yards and an interception.
Venables said Hawkins and Arnold will compete for the starting job heading into Saturday’s game at Auburn. He said Hawkins, a freshman, handled the situation well.
“Mike is — he’s confident,” Venables said. “He’s loose in the right way. The moment’s not going to overwhelm him, even though he’s a young guy.” 
Oklahoma defensive back Kendel Dolby was carted off in the second quarter after a gruesome injury to his lower right leg. Venables said it was a dislocated ankle, and Dolby soon will have surgery. 
All wasn’t bad for Oklahoma. The Sooners actually recovered fumbles by Iamaleava twice in the second quarter, only to have Arnold fumble the ball back to Tennessee on the next play both times. Oklahoma gained minus-20 yards in the second quarter as Tennessee took a 19-3 lead at the break.
Tennessee led 22-3 when Hawkins led the Sooners down the field and found Barnes for a 2-yard touchdown pass. The extra point failed after a personal foul penalty turned it into a 35-yard kick. That ended Tennessee’s run of 19 consecutive quarters without allowing a touchdown, dating back to last season.
The Volunteers closed it out and earned a quality road win to start league play.
“We’ve got a good football team,” Heupel said. “We’ve got high expectations. And they continue to compete extremely hard every day to grow, to become better. This was our first road test in the league. Tonight was about this ’24 football team, and I’m really proud of how they performed.”
Tennessee: The offense was solid, despite struggling with injuries to starting offensive tackles Lance Heard and John Campbell Jr. Heard didn’t play and Campbell suffered a leg injury early in the game and was limited. The Volunteers didn’t put up the crazy numbers they had in their first three games — they were averaging 63.7 points — but they did enough.
Oklahoma: The Sooners could not block the Volunteers, so their quarterbacks were under duress all night. Add in-game injuries to receiver Nic Anderson and running back Taylor Tatum, and it all snowballed.
Venables said Anderson re-injured a quad and he’s not sure what his status will be next week. The Sooners’ top returning receiver missed the first three games with an undisclosed injury. 
The Sooners held the Volunteers to six points and 141 yards in the second half. 
“I think we kind of did everything we could,” linebacker Danny Stutsman said. “I mean, obviously, defense didn’t play perfectly. We made a ton of mistakes, myself included. Really, they shouldn’t score any points and we’ll win every game.”
Tennessee: Visits Arkansas on Oct. 5.
Oklahoma: Visits Auburn on Saturday.

ATLANTA (AP) — Max Fried pitched three-hit ball over 8 2/3 innings to lead the Atlanta Braves to a 3-0 victory over Kansas City on Friday night, but the Royals still got a chance to pop the corks on their first postseason berth since 2015. 
Kansas City locked up an American League wild card when Minnesota lost to Baltimore 7-2, setting off a delayed but raucous celebration in the visitors’ clubhouse at Truist Park.
“We’re just so proud of everyone,” Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. said. “This is just the beginning of something special.”
It was a big night, too, for the Braves, who now hold a National League wild-card spot after the Mets and Diamondbacks both lost.
Sean Murphy hit a two-run homer for the Braves and Marcell Ozuna trotted home on a throwing error after his first stolen base since 2022.
The Braves and Mets are set to play a doubleheader Monday in Atlanta — a day after the scheduled end of the regular season — to make up two games between the NL East rivals that were washed out this week by torrential rain from Hurricane Helene.
“This is a big game, obviously. Every game counts,” Fried said. “Knowing that this potentially could be the last game that I pitched this season, I just wanted to do everything I could to leave everything out there and try to win.”
The Royals came in with their magic number at one to clinch their first playoff appearance since winning the 2015 World Series. They failed to take care of business themselves, holding off their celebration until the game in Minneapolis was completed.


Fried (11-10) came within one out of a shutout, giving way to Raisel Iglesias when the Royals put runners at second and third. Iglesias retired Salvador Perez on a flyout for his 33rd save.
It was Fried’s first career start against the Royals. 
“We knew it was (going to be) tough, watching him and seeing him over the years,” Royals manager Matt Quatraro said. “He’s got multiple pitches that are plus pitches. He uses them all. He very rarely falls into any sort of patterns. ... That was masterful pitching.”
Fried threw 98 pitches, 63 for strikes. He walked two and struck out nine.
“You know exactly what you need to do,” Fried said. “We had to win this game and I just left everything out there.”
Royals starter Brady Singer (9-13) allowed two runs on four hits with three walks and five strikeouts. Murphy homered on an 0-2 sweeper that caught the middle of the zone in the fourth.
“I’m obviously trying to get that off the plate a little bit more there,” Singer said. “I kept it in the zone and he put a good swing on it. If I could just get that ball further off the plate I like my chances a little bit more.”
Ozuna tacked on an unlikely insurance run in the eighth by stealing third. Caught off guard, Perez threw the ball into left field, allowing Ozuna to make it home to a giddy celebration in the Atlanta dugout.
“They gave him the base,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said with a smile.
Fried has spent his entire career with the Braves, but he’s set to become a free agent after the World Series.
The left-hander recognized the significance of the moment as he walked off the field to a huge cheer from the crowd at Truist Park. Depending on how the season plays out, it could’ve been his final home game in a Braves uniform.
“Walking off and hearing that, it was emotional,” Fried said. “I am extremely thankful and very, very grateful.”
There has been no indication that the Braves are pursuing a new long-term contract with Fried, a two-time All-Star who is 73-36 over eight seasons with Atlanta.
“I don’t know what the future holds, but this is really all I know,” Fried said. “I do love it.”
Royals: 1B Vinnie Pasquantino (broken right thumb) was on the field during batting practice and will take simulated at-bats against reliever Will Smith on Saturday.
Braves: RHP Reynaldo López (shoulder inflammation) threw his second side session Thursday, felt good and will be activated to start Saturday, Snitker said.
RHP Seth Lugo (16-9, 3.03 ERA) will start for the Royals in the second game of the series. López (8-5, 2.03) will make his first appearance since a start at Washington on Sept. 10. He lasted only one inning because of shoulder pain that sent him to the 15-day injured list. Lugo allowed two runs on three hits over seven innings in his last outing, a 2-0 loss to the Giants on Sept. 22.

Vaughn Grissom reached base four times, scored once and drove in a run as the Red Sox won their fourth straight.
Boston trailed 3-0 after six innings, scored two in the seventh and tied it in the eighth.
“It’s just a testament to who we are as a group, that we’re never out of a fight,” Grissom said. “That’s what you need. The best teams are never out of the fight. That’s huge.”
Story went 2 for 5 with two doubles. He gave Boston its first lead with his one-out two-bagger off Tommy Nance (0-3) that began a three-run 10th.
“He got a slider in the zone and put a great swing on it,” Cora said.
Pinch-hitter Connor Wong drove in a run with a grounder and Grissom added an RBI single.
Chris Martin (3-1) worked a scoreless ninth.
Toronto lost its fifth straight. The Blue Jays are 19-30 in one-run games.
Leo Jiménez cut it to 6-4 in the bottom of the 10th with an RBI double off Zach Penrod, who exited after walking Nathan Lukes.
Chase Shugart got Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to fly out, walked Spencer Horwitz to load the bases, then walked Alejandro Kirk to force in a run. Shugart then ended it by getting Addison Barger to pop up. The save was the first of his career.


The Blue Jays have lost all five home meetings with Boston this season.
Guerrero opened the scoring with a two-run double off Brayan Bello in the third. He has 102 RBIs this season.
Lukes made it 3-0 with a sacrifice fly in the sixth.
Ceddanne Rafaela started Boston’s comeback with a two-run single off Ryan Burr in the seventh. Rafaela has 61 RBIs from the ninth spot in the order this season.
Boston tied it against Génesis Cabrera in the eighth. Romy Gonzalez led off with a single, advanced to third on a hit by Triston Casas and scored on Masataka Yoshida’s grounder.
In his final start of the season, Toronto’s Bowden Francis pitched five scoreless innings. He allowed three hits, walked one and struck out four.
“Just another outstanding effort,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. “You can’t really say enough about how he finished up the season.”
Francis went 4-2 with a 1.33 ERA over his final eight starts, twice taking no-hit bids into the ninth inning.
Blue Jays: Toronto optioned RHP Zach Pop to its spring training facility and recalled LHP Easton Lucas from Triple-A Buffalo. ... INF Orelvis Martinez was reinstated from the suspended list and optioned to the spring facility. To make room on the 40-man roster, OF Daulton Varsho was transferred to the 60-day injured list. Varsho had shoulder surgery on Monday.
Toronto RHP Kevin Gausman (13-11, 3.91 ERA) is scheduled to make his final start of the season in Wednesday’s series finale. Red Sox RHP Richard Fitts (0-0, 0.00) is set for his fourth career start.

NEWCASTLE, Northern Ireland (AP) — Rory McIlroy birdied his final three holes to shoot 3-under 68 and sit two strokes off the first-round lead at the Irish Open on Thursday.
The No. 3-ranked McIlroy is attempting to win his home tournament for the second time — eight years after the first — and is playing at Royal County Down Golf Club, a course that is a short drive from his childhood home of Holywood in Northern Ireland and where he used to play with his friends.
“It’s a major championship-caliber golf course,” McIlroy said. “It’s just unfortunate that we don’t have the infrastructure around the golf course to host something like an Open because if we did, it definitely would be able to host an Open Championship.”
Tough winds and some rain made for difficult conditions and No. 291-ranked Todd Clements of England dealt with it the best, making five birdies and a 15-footer for eagle at the 18th — his ninth hole — for a 66 and a one-stroke lead.
“I said to my caddie walking off, ‘That’s one of the best rounds I’ve played in my life,” Clements said. ”It’s a hard course and yeah, delighted how it panned out.”
Sami Valimaki of Finland and Alejandro Del Rey of Spain were in a tie for second after 67s. McIlroy was in a five-man group a further stroke back — but only after a strong finish, just as his round looked like derailing after bogeys at Nos. 14 and 15 dropped him to level par.


A tap-in for birdie at the drivable 16th was followed by a 12-footer for birdie at the 17th. He reached the green in two at the par-15 18th and two-putted from 50 feet for three in a row.
“I felt like I controlled my ball flight well,” McIlroy said. “I’ve been working a little bit on my swing these last couple of weeks. I’ve probably struggled a lot in left-to-right winds this year, so to sort of control my ball flight a bit and test it out there today was good to see that, you know, I was able to do it when I needed to.”
McIlroy, who openly admits to struggling when playing in front of expectant home crowds, is back in Europe after the end of the PGA Tour season. So is Robert MacIntyre, the No. 16-ranked Scot who is looking to become the first player ever to win the Scottish and Irish Opens in the same season.
MacIntyre opened with an even-par 71 while fellow Ryder Cup players Shane Lowry and Nicolai Hojgaard both shot 72.

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The Arizona Cardinals were in serious need of a franchise reset when coach Jonathan Gannon and general manager Monti Ossenfort were hired two seasons ago.
There was an understanding it might take some time to turn things around.
But 21 games into their tenure, patience is getting a little thin.
The Cardinals (1-3) suffered a crushing 42-14 loss to the Washington Commanders on Sunday — perhaps the most discouraging of the new regime’s tenure. Arizona took a 7-0 lead on the opening drive after a 2-yard touchdown pass from Kyler Murray and rookie Marvin Harrison Jr., but were outplayed in virtually every facet from that point forward.
“Just trying to process what just happened,” Murray said on Sunday.
The loss was made even worse by the fact that the Commanders’ offense was led by Kliff Kingsbury, the former Cardinals head coach for four seasons who was fired in 2022. That’s what started this whole rebuild in the first place.
Now the Commanders and their offense are the talk of the NFL. 
The Cardinals are the same ol’ Cardinals. They’re 5-16 since Gannon and Ossenfort took over.
“This league’s very humbling and we got humbled today, so we’ll get back to it,” Gannon said. “The positive will be what we get out of this tape tomorrow, the adjustments that we make, the corrections that we make and we’ll get better from it.”
Murray has — usually — taken the recent losing in stride since his return from a knee injury midway through last season. But the quarterback was understandably frustrated after Sunday’s game. He completed 16 of 22 passes for 142 yards and a touchdown, but was also sacked four times and didn’t have the usual magic with his scrambling ability.


“Something’s got to change,” Murray said. “We weren’t good enough today and they exploited our weaknesses.”

James Conner bounced back from his worst game of the season, rushing for 104 yards against the Commanders. The veteran provided his usual, bruising presence throughout the game. 
The Cardinals’ pass rush was basically nonexistent, finishing the day with no sacks and one quarterback hurry. Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels was good at throwing the ball quickly, but Arizona has to find a way to make opposing quarterbacks uncomfortable.
Cornerback Garrett Williams had a spectacular interception in the first half, leaping to grab a pass from Daniels before tumbling to the grass while managing to hold onto the football. The Cardinals have lacked big-time playmakers on the defense, particularly at corner, for the past few seasons. Williams — now in his second season — appears to be getting better.
Gannon and the coaching staff. The second-year coach has brought a youthful, yet no-nonsense, demeanor to the franchise that’s been mostly well received. But the vibes are wearing out in a hurry. The Cardinals players — particularly Murray — are going to want to start winning some games soon.
“We’ve got to adapt a little bit and that starts with me,” Gannon said. “We can’t look like that, because we didn’t give ourselves a chance to win the game, so we’ll get back at it.”
One silver lining for the Cardinals is they came out of Sunday’s game fairly healthy. Rookie DL Darius Robinson (calf) is eligible to come off injured reserve this week, but it’s unclear if he’ll be ready. TE Trey McBride missed Sunday’s game with a concussion but Gannon was optimistic that he might return.
4-8 — That’s the record for the Cardinals since Murray returned midway through last season. He was out roughly 11 months because of a torn ACL suffered in 2022.
The Cardinals go back on the road against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.

LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) — Hinano Rodrigues remembers being 4 or 5 years old, carrying a bucket across a highway to the ocean in the Maui community where he still lives.

At dawn, he would accompany his grandmother to a reef at low tide, where she plucked black snails, spiny lobsters and spiky sea urchins from the craggy rock. In Hawaiian, she would instruct him to break off a branch of kiawe, a type of mesquite, to tease out an octopus hiding in a hole.

It taught Rodrigues, 71, the value of ahupuaa, a Native Hawaiian system for dividing land from the mountains down to the ocean, with the residents of each section living off the land and waters within it.

But now the section where he lives and where his ancestors have always lived — the Olowalu ahupuaa — is also home to a temporary landfill being used to store debris from the deadly wildfire that decimated the historic nearby town of Lahaina last summer, destroying thousands of buildings and killing 102 people. It’s enough refuse to cover five football fields five stories high, including soil contaminated with lead and arsenic.

A controversy over whether that site is truly temporary — and over where the debris might finally wind up — has sparked a fierce legal fight with tens of millions of dollars at stake, not to mention a priceless ecosystem rich with coral, manta rays and other sea life just offshore.

“Why would you go put opala like this in a place that’s clean?” Rodrigues asked, using a Hawaiian word for trash.



Handling debris after large wildfires is always a logistical challenge. After the 2018 Camp Fire killed 85 people and burned down most of the town of Paradise, California, more than 300,000 truck loads were required to transport the debris to three different landfills, said Cole Glenwright, the deputy incident commander of the debris removal operation. The whole process took about a year.

It’s taking much longer on Maui, given environmental concerns, how long it has taken to clear destroyed lots, worries about Native Hawaiian cultural sites, and tussling over the ownership of a potential permanent site for the debris.

The temporary landfill in Olowalu is a former quarry on state-owned land and close to Lahaina, which made it a convenient choice for quickly storing the debris being cleared away so the town can rebuild. Officials believe its arid climate will reduce the risk of contamination spreading, and they say they’ve taken many precautions, including using thick liner and stormwater controls to contain runoff.

Officials have analyzed samples of soil, groundwater and surface water and found no traces of contamination being released, according to a quarterly report released in July.

But the site is just uphill from a coral reef, and some locals fear an ecological catastrophe if pollution does reach the water. 

The operation of the site also threatens sacred Hawaiian shrines and altars and desecrates ancient Hawaiian burial sites, according to a lawsuit filed by two people who don’t want the debris in Olowalu. One of the plaintiffs is Manoa Ka’io Martin, whose ancestors are among those buried nearby. The other is farmer Eddy Garcia, who worries about contamination of the food he grows, including taro, bananas, pineapples and starfruit.

Amid demands to remove the debris from Olowalu, Maui County is seeking to seize a privately owned former quarry near the Central Maui Landfill across the island to use as a permanent dump site.

That’s prompted another legal fight. The company that owns the land, Komar Maui Properties, doesn’t want to give it up.

Komar bought the land in 2015 with plans to build a private landfill, but it says permitting issues have stalled development. It is contesting the county’s effort to take the property by eminent domain — a process by which governments can seize private land for public use, with fair compensation for the owner. A federal judge has prevented the county from taking immediate possession while the lawsuit plays out.

Andy Naden, general counsel and executive vice president of Komar Investments, the parent company of Komar Maui Properties, says the county moved to seize its land only after learning the Federal Emergency Management Agency would pay “tipping fees” associated with disposing of the Lahaina debris — fees typically paid by weight to landfill owners. Maui County charges a tipping fee of nearly $110 per ton for municipal solid waste.

“FEMA is going to dump 400,000 tons into this hole,” Naden said. “That equates to $44 million that the federal government is going to give to whoever has the hole.”

Shayne Agawa, director of Maui’s Department of Environmental Management, disputed that. He said his department has long been interested in acquiring the land as part of plans to expand the adjacent public landfill.

Agawa, who lives in Olowalu, said the county doesn’t want the debris to remain at the temporary site. But it has yet to come up with a backup plan in case the court blocks the county from seizing Komar’s land. Officials are looking at other nearby parcels, he said.

To respond to cultural concerns, Maui officials consulted with the county’s archaeologist, Janet Six, and FEMA had one of its historic advisors assess the site. Six told The Associated Press she could not rule out the presence of ancient cultural sites or burial grounds, but noted that the area was previously disturbed by mining. FEMA found that no historic properties would be affected.

The lawsuit filed by Garcia and Martin asserted that the construction and operation of the temporary dump has in fact damaged or desecrated such sites by exposing them to toxic material, in violation of Martin’s spiritual practices.

Garcia said he feels uneasy as rumbling trucks haul debris up the road next to his farm. He worries one heavy bout of rain will cause toxins from the debris to contaminate the food he grows.

The pair dropped their lawsuit after the county announced plans for the permanent site in central Maui, but their lawyer is considering their next legal steps while the debris sits in Olowalu.

“I have a feeling they’re going to try to make it permanent and just say, ‘Sorry, we can’t move it to the other site,’” Garcia said.

Further complicating the issue is that the ashes or bones of some fire victims might be mingled in the debris. Raenelle Stewart’s 97-year-old grandmother died in the fire. Stewart often wonders if the ashes the family received contained all her remains. The fire debris should be kept nearby, she said.

“I think they should designate a spot in Lahaina for it,” she said. “I don’t think it’s so toxic that the earth can’t handle.”

Randy Awo, a retired administrator in the state Department of Land and Natural Resources, is a Native Hawaiian resident of Maui. He’d prefer to have the debris shipped out of state — an option officials rejected as too expensive.

Awo called the concerns about remains “a sacred topic” and said he does not want to be insensitive to families who lost loved ones. But, he added, the community must also protect Maui’s finite amount of land.

“When our environment is subjected to toxins that threaten life itself,” Awo said, “we have to start making decisions that weigh both.”",True

Arizona (2-1, 0-0 Big 12) at No. 10 Utah (4-0, 1-0), Saturday, 10:15 p.m. ET (ESPN)
BetMGM College Football Odds: Utah by 12 1/2.
Series record: Utah 26-20-2.
Following a bye week, Arizona officially opens Big 12 play against fellow league newcomer Utah. The Wildcats routed the Utes 42-18 a year ago to snap a six-game losing streak in the series. Utah looked impressive in a 22-19 win over Oklahoma State and is eager to dish out revenge. Arizona could use an upset win to resolve questions about its offense following a 31-7 loss to Kansas State two weeks earlier.
Can Arizona’s front seven stop Utah’s resurgent rushing attack? The Utes piled up a season-high 249 yards on the ground against Oklahoma State. Micah Bernard led the way with a career-best 182 yards on a career-high 25 carries. The Wildcats have allowed 222.5 rushing yards per game against FBS opponents this season.
Arizona: Moving the chains against Utah will come down to how much Tetairoa McMillan is involved in the offense. McMillan tallied 116 yards and a touchdown on eight catches versus the Utes a year ago. He has nine career games with 100 or more receiving yards and leads the Big 12 with 151.0 receiving yards per game.
Utah: Will Bernard make it four in a row? Bernard is the first Utah running back since Ty Jordan in 2020 to put up three straight 100-yard rushing games after having just two 100-games in his career entering the season. He leads the Big 12 with 456 total rushing yards while averaging 6.9 yards per carry.


Utah leads the Big 12 with 3.0 sacks per game. Utes defensive end Van Fillinger tops the league with 5.5 sacks through four games. … Arizona QB Noah Fifita needs three touchdown passes to pass Matt Scott for 12th place in the school’s career passing touchdowns list. … Utah leads the Big 12 and ranks fourth nationally in time of possession (36:21). … Arizona’s last road win against Utah came in 2014. … Utah is one of three Big 12 teams – along with UCF and Kansas State – rushing for at least 200 yards per game while holding opponents under 100. The Utes average 206.3 rushing yards and allow 93.8 yards on the ground per contest.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek opposition leader Stefanos Kasselakis was ousted by his party’s central committee Sunday via a motion of no confidence, just a year after his election to the post by party cadres who accused him of being an authoritarian and not fully ideologically aligned with the party. 
After an often tense and acrimonious two-day session, the central committee of the left-wing Syriza party approved the no-confidence motion 163-120, with three members voting blank. Another eight abstained.
It was not a single event that precipitated Kasselakis’ ouster but, a buildup of discontent over the past year, which caused many who had viewed him as a charismatic savior to view him as someone bent on turning the party into a personal vehicle.
Kasselakis reacted to the result of the vote by saying that he felt “liberated.” He did not say whether he will join a new leadership contest.
“Now, the people know how I felt censured ever since I was elected,” Kasselakis said. He attacked Syriza’s “bureaucracy” for overturning the decision of the party base and, criticized the secret ballot. He and his supporters preferred an open show of hands.
He compared the secret ballot’s promoters to the hooded collaborators in World War II. Cries of “shame!” greeted his comparison, which has been taken up by vociferous Kasselakis supporters on social media.
Kasselakis, 36, was elected in September 2023 by voters stunned over the magnitude of defeat in two successive elections in May and June 2023 at the hands of a conservative party that had already served a full term. 


After long-term party leader and former prime minister Alexis Tsipras resigned, party supporters turned to Stefanos Kasselakis — an outsider, a political neophyte, and a Miami, Florida resident. He had no connection to the party before he became a candidate for the May election. A four-minute video in which he told his life story shot him to prominence and made him the favorite.
From the start, Kasselakis’ past and style rankled with party cadres. A former Goldman Sachs employee and shipowner and onetime registered Republican, some of his positions, such as advocating stock options for employees, incensed the old-schoolers who accused him of wanting to turn Syriza into an ideologically vague party. They mocked his heavy use of social media and called him Trumpian.
But this meant nothing to a party base that idolized Kasselakis and expected him to rejuvenate the party. He easily saw off his loudest detractors, including his main leadership rival. They formed another party, New Left, which has fared poorly. Then, Kasselakis started picking fights with many of those who remained.
In last June’s European elections – without much at stake domestically and amid record abstention – the ruling conservatives’ vote share plunged, but it was the far right that mostly gained. Syriza’s vote share declined further.
Electoral failure damaged Kasselakis’ aura and his supposed attractiveness to voters. Criticism, and Kasselakis’ pushback, intensified, leading, almost inevitably, to the no-confidence motion.
The central committee will now set a date for an extraordinary party congress, which must happen within three months, where leadership hopefuls will present their candidacies. Then, party members and friends will vote for the leader in one or, if necessary, two rounds. 
When Kasselakis was elected, about 150,000 showed up for the first round and 136,000 for the second. As with the ruling conservatives and the socialist PASOK party, voting eligibility rules are very loose. One just has to show up, declare themselves a party “friend” if not already a member and pay a two-euro ($2.20) fee.",False

No. 2 Georgia (3-0, 1-0 SEC) at No. 4 Alabama (3-0, 0-0), 7:30 p.m. EDT, Saturday, (ABC). 
The Bulldogs and Crimson Tide meet again, just 10 months after ‘Bama’s 27-24 SEC championship-game victory ended Georgia’s 29-game winning streak and derailed the ‘Dawgs’ quest to win a third consecutive national title. Alabama opens league play after an off week following a 42-10 victory at Wisconsin led by quarterback Jalen Milroe, who passed for three of his five touchdowns and 196 of his 271 yards of offense. Milroe has passed for eight of his 14 TDs this season and been mentioned as a possible Heisman Trophy candidate. The Tide come in averaging 466.7 yards per game and rank sixth in SEC offense. The Bulldogs had a week to regroup after escaping Kentucky 13-12 in their SEC opener to extend their impressive defensive streak of not allowing a touchdown to four games dating to last season’s Orange Bowl win over Florida State. Georgia ranks third in FBS scoring defense (6.0 points per game) and fourth in total defense (202 yards). Alabama is 11 spots lower at 248.0. 
Georgia is favored by 1-1/2 points, according to BetMGM College Sports Odds.
The other four SEC matchups include top-ranked Texas (4-0) hosting rebuilding Mississippi State in its inaugural league game; No. 6 Ole Miss opening SEC play against visiting Kentucky, which seeks its first league win; Oklahoma visiting Auburn; and Arkansas traveling to Texas A&M after both won their conference openers.


Texas is a 38-1/2-point favorite according to BetMGM, but the Longhorns don’t know who will start at quarterback. Quinn Ewers returned to practice this week from an abdominal strain that sidelined him against Louisiana-Monroe but is questionable. Arch Manning earned his career win as a starter, passing for two TDs along with two interceptions in the 51-3 rout. MSU lost transfer QB Blake Shapen to a season-ending shoulder injury and will start Michael Van Buren, with Chris Parson also expected to play. 
LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier threw TD passes of 45, 35 and 5 yards and 352 overall to beat Big Ten newcomer UCLA 34-17. He completed a career-best 32 of 44 attempts and led second-half scoring drives of 96 and 92 yards for a two-TD lead. Nussmeier has four 300-yard passing games in five starts dating back to last season’s ReliaQuest Bowl. His 113 completions lead the nation and he ranks second with 28.3 per game.
Tennessee held Oklahoma to a season-low 36 yards rushing in a 25-15 victory, its fewest against an SEC foe since Florida gained just 19 on the Volunteers in 2020. ... Missouri graduate running back Nate Noel Noel rushed for a career-high 199 yards on 24 carries against Vanderbilt, the most yardage by a SEC player this season. … Blake Shapen had thrown for 974 yards and eight TDs before his injury, totals that rank third and fourth respectively in the SEC. His 108 completions also rank fourth … Kentucky snapped a two-game touchdown drought with four rushing scores against Ohio, a 41-10 win that ended a two-game slide. Receiver Dane Key had seven catches for a career-high 145 yards.
Georgia has won just two of the past 10 meetings against Alabama but is coming off an off week, where the Bulldogs have excelled under coach Kirby Smart. They are 10-1 after an open date in his tenure, most recently 43-20 over rival Florida last season in Jacksonville.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Donald Trump plans to deliver remarks next Monday about cryptocurrency and the launch of the company World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform controlled by the Republican nominee’s sons Donald Jr. and Eric.
His speech will come 50 days before Election Day, an extraordinary use of dwindling campaign time to promote a personal business. The Republican former president has long mixed his political and business interests and marketed sneakers, photo books and Trump-branded Bibles during his 2024 campaign.
“We’re embracing the future with crypto and leaving the slow and outdated big banks behind,” Trump said in a video posted Thursday to X, the social media site that will also host his address on the subject at 8 p.m. EDT on Monday from his Mar-a-Lago home.
As part of his presidential campaign, Trump has pledged to turn the United States into the “crypto capital of the planet,” raising red flags that he could use the federal government to help support a business tied to his family.
Cryptocurrencies are forms of digital money that can be traded over the internet without relying on the global banking system. The trading often depends on online marketplaces that charge fees for transactions, so that the cryptocurrencies can be exchanged for U.S. dollars and other currencies.
Trump opposed crypto during his presidency, but he has since warmed to the sector. He has suggested the government create a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and has vowed to block the creation of a Federal Reserve-administered Central Bank Digital Currency, a digital form of central bank money that would be available to the public.",False

HIGHLAND, Calif. (AP) — An out-of-control wildfire in the foothills of a national forest east of Los Angeles threatened ten of thousands of buildings and forced hundreds of residents to flee Sunday amid a days-long heat wave of triple-digit temperatures.
The so-called Line Fire was burning along the edge of the San Bernardino National Forest, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Los Angeles. As of Sunday morning, the blaze had charred about 27 square miles (70 square kilometers) of grass and chaparral, leaving a thick cloud of dark smoke blanketing the area. 
The fire burned so hot Saturday that it created its own thunderstorm-like weather systems of pyroculumus clouds, which could bring more challenging conditions such as gusty winds and lightning strikes, according to the National Weather Service. Firefighters also faced steep terrain, which limited their ability to control the blaze, officials said. The fire remained uncontained Sunday afternoon. 
County officials, who declared an emergency Saturday evening, issued evacuation orders for Running Springs, Arrowbear Lake, areas east of Highway 330 and other regions. 
Running Springs resident Steven Michael King said he had planned to stay to fight the fire and help his neighbors until Sunday morning, when the fire escalated. He had prepped his house to prevent fire damage but decided to leave out of fear smoke could keep him from finding a way out later. 


“It came down to, which is worse, being trapped or being in a shelter?” he said outside an evacuation center Sunday. “When conditions changed, I had to make a quick decision, just a couple of packs and it all fits in a shopping cart.”
 Joseph Escobedo said his family has lived in Angelus Oaks for about three years and has never had to evacuate for wildfire. His family, with three young children, was among the remaining few who haven’t left the area as of Sunday afternoon. 
“It’s kind of frightening with the possibility of losing your home and losing everything we worked really hard for,” Escobedo said as his family packed up the essentials to leave. ”It’s hard to leave and not be sure if you’re gonna be able to come back.”
Arrowbear Lake resident Michael Lee said he left his home with his dog Saturday afternoon. Lee, a photographer, had turned back to retrieve a camera and didn’t get to the evacuation center in Highland until nearly seven hours later. 
“I wanna get back to home,” Lee said sitting in his car outside the evacuation center. “The triple-digit weather down here is nasty.”
State firefighters said three firefighters had been injured and more than 35,000 structures were threatened, including single and multi-family homes and commercial buildings. Thunderstorms expected later in the day could make it even more challenging to rein in the fire. 
“Afternoon thunderstorms could cause new ignitions and potentially influence activity around the fire perimeter,” state firefighters said in a Sunday morning update. “Hot and dry conditions mixed with thunderstorms are expected to challenge firefighters for the next few days.” 
The affected area is near small mountain towns in the San Bernardino National Forest where Southern California residents ski in the winter and mountain bike in the summer. Running Springs is on the route to the popular ski resort town of Big Bear. 
Joe Franco, a worker at Noah’s Restaurant in the downtown section of San Bernardino, said his friends in the surrounding evacuation zones were gearing up to leave at a moment’s notice. Smoke from the fire had already blanketed downtown San Bernardino, Franco said. 
“They’re just kind of hanging on tight and getting their stuff ready to move,” Franco said of his friends. ”Normally they’re here, but a lot of people are not coming today.”
The fire prompted Redlands Unified School District to cancel Monday classes for roughly 20,000 students. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency for San Bernardino County Saturday night. 
A small vegetation fire that started Sunday afternoon in Clearlake City, 110 miles (117 kilometers) north of San Francisco, was forcing roughly 4,000 people to evacuate and burning structures. Officials said at least 30 homes and commercial buildings were on fire. Firefighters said they were gaining ground against the blaze Sunday afternoon. 
More firefighters were expected to arrive in San Bernadino County Sunday. State officials said vegetation is critically dry in the area and temperatures reached more than 100 degrees (39 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, with relative humidity ideal for the fire to spread. The blaze began Thursday evening, and the cause is under investigation. 
More than 600 firefighters were battling the fire, supported by water-dropping helicopters that hovered over homes and hillsides, along with other aircraft, according to state firefighters. Cal Fire officials didn’t return calls on Sunday seeking more information about three injured firefighters.
The fire produced coiling clouds of dense smoke, and flames could be seen cresting hillside ridges. 
No homes or other structures had been damaged or destroyed.
The National Weather Service said downtown Los Angeles hit a high of 112 degrees Fahrenheit (44 Celsius) Friday, which marked the third time since 1877 that a temperature that high has been reached there.",False

Publication date:2024-09-09 07:00:00

WASHINGTON (AP) — New Jersey has a new U.S. senator after the August resignation of Democrat Bob Menendez.
Sen. George Helmy, a Democrat and former chief of staff to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, was sworn in on Monday and will serve in office for about two months until the November election. Democratic Rep. Andy Kim and Republican hotelier Curtis Bashaw are vying for the seat in November and the winner will immediately replace Helmy.
Menendez resigned in August after he was convicted on charges that he used his influence to meddle in three different state and federal criminal investigations. Prosecutors said he helped one bribe-paying friend get a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund and another keep a contract to provide religious certification for meat bound for Egypt.
Murphy appointed Helmy to the temporary role after Menendez announced his intention to resign. Murphy said he picked Helmy because he understands the role after serving as an aide to New Jersey U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and the late New Jersey U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg. 
Booker, now the state’s senior senator, stood with Helmy as he was given the oath of office by Washington Sen. Patty Murray, who is the senior-most Democrat and serves as Senate president pro tempore.
Helmy, 44, served as Murphy’s chief of staff from 2019 until 2023 and then served as an executive at one of the state’s largest health care providers, RWJBarnabas Health. He previously served as Booker’s state director in the Senate. He is the son of Egyptian parents who immigrated to New Jersey 


After he was sworn in, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer welcomed Helmy to the chamber and said that he was making history as the first member of the Coptic Orthodox Church to become a senator. Dozens of Helmy’s friends and family watched from the gallery above. 
“We wish him nothing but success and are ready to assist him however necessary in the weeks and months to come,” Schumer said.
When Murphy announced his appointment, Helmy said he had never sought and would never seek elected office. He said he would focus on serving the public during his short stint in the Senate.
“New Jersey deserves its full voice and representation in the whole of the United States Senate,” he said.
Menendez was also convicted of taking actions that benefited Egypt’s government in exchange for bribes, including providing details on personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and ghostwriting a letter to fellow senators regarding lifting a hold on military aid to Egypt. FBI agents also said they found stacks of gold bars and $480,000 hidden in Menendez’s house.
Menendez has denied all of the allegations against him and has said he’s planning to appeal the convictions.",False

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Cade Povich pitched shutout ball into the sixth, Ryan O’Hearn and Colton Cowser homered and the Baltimore Orioles eliminated the Minnesota Twins from postseason contention with a 7-2 victory Friday night.
The Orioles wrapped up the top AL wild-card spot, and will host either Detroit or Kansas City in the opening round next week.
“To get home field through the wild card is huge,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “We’re going to be pumped to play in front of our fans. There’s going to be a lot of energy and excitement in the ballpark.” 
By the fifth inning, the Twins knew the Tigers had won and the Royals had lost, meaning a victory would keep their playoff hopes alive. But they could only muster two hits through the first eight innings and trailed 7-0.
At their high-water mark of the season on Aug. 17, the Twins were 70-53 and had a five-game cushion in the wild-card race. Since then, they are 12-25.
“It was clearly beyond a disappointing way to end a run and what was, and appeared to be, a promising season that we had going,” said Twins manager Rocco Baldelli, whose team was the defending AL Central champions. 
Povich (3-9) gave up just two hits and walked one while striking out two in 5 2/3 innings. The rookie left-hander was making his first career start against the team that selected him in the third round of the 2021 draft. The Twins traded him to Baltimore a year later as the centerpiece of a package used to acquire reliever Jorge Lopez.


“I’m just treating every start like it’s kind of a tryout for the postseason,” said Povich, who went 2-2 with a 2.60 ERA in five September starts. 
Twins starter Pablo López (15-10) allowed two runs on six hits with three walks and eight strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings.
“It’s tough,” López said about the Twins’ collapse. “We were riding the high for so long. Everything was going well. Things were fun. Things were clicking. And then nothing was clicking.”
O’Hearn started the scoring for the Orioles with a two-run homer to deep right in the second inning.
The Orioles loaded the bases with one out in the fifth. But López struck out Ramón Urías on his career-high 111th pitch of the night. Then reliever Caleb Thielbar retired Gunner Henderson on a grounder to keep it 2-0.
Cowser tagged Thielbar’s pitch for his 24th homer of the season in the seventh. Baltimore tacked on four more runs in the eighth on five singles off reliever Kody Funderburk.
The Twins broke up the shutout in the ninth on Carlos Santana’s two-run single.
Now, the Twins are looking at an offseason spent trying to figure out what went wrong and how to avoid a repeat in the future.
“You don’t react emotionally in these moments. Really, you look at it big-picture,” Baldelli said. “You look at how the season went as a whole. We’re also going to look at how the last six weeks went, because that’s what a lot of us are feeling right now.”
RHP Zebby Matthews (1-3, 5.71) was set to start Saturday for the Twins. The Orioles had not announced their starter.

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Arizona had one of the NFL’s best offenses through the first two games behind the sound decision making of quarterback Kyler Murray.
The Cardinals ran into a wall of Lions and Murray had his first big mistake of the season on Sunday, leading to a stuck-in-the-mud 20-13 loss to Detroit.
“We just didn’t hit,” Murray said. “There’s going to be games like that offensively. It happens and that’s a good team over there.”
The Cardinals (1-2) averaged 34.5 points and 379.5 yards their first two games, showing some progression following consecutive 4-13 seasons.
The Lions (2-1) ground them to a halt, using a key interception and two fourth-down stops to remain undefeated (5-0-1) against Arizona since 2017. 
“Our effort was there. That’s not the reason we lost a game,” Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said. “The reason we lost a game starts with me. We’ve got to do a better job setting up all three game plans.”
The Cardinals got off to a solid start, matching Detroit’s opening-drive touchdown with one of their own, a 10-yard pass from Murray to Marvin Harrison Jr.
They spent the rest of the afternoon bumbling away chances in a game that remained close, thanks to Arizona’s defense.
The Cardinals finished with 275 total yards — 77 rushing on 18 carries — and were 1 of 9 on third down after leading the NFL at 58% the first two games. Arizona went 0 for 2 on fourth down.


“Our identity as an offense is we want to run the ball,” said Cardinals receiver Michael Wilson, who had eight catches for 64 yards. “When that element isn’t working, it makes everything else harder.”
Murray had the biggest gaffe after making good decisions through most of the first two games.

With the Cardinals down 20-10 in the third quarter, he tried to force the ball to Harrison against double coverage, hoping the rookie receiver could make a play. Murray instead underthrew the ball and Kerby Joseph easily intercepted it in the end zone.
“That one stung, especially since I felt like we were going to score,” said Murray, who finished with 205 yards on 21-of-34 passing, adding a team-high 45 yards rushing on five carries. “And for it to end like that, it sucks.”
Arizona’s defense held its own in the second half after allowing 20 points in the first, giving the Cardinals a chance.
They couldn’t capitalize.
Dennis Gardeck picked off Jared Goff’s pass in the third quarter, giving the Cardinals the ball at Detroit’s 34. Faced with a fourth-and-1 at the 24, Arizona appeared to have converted on a run by Murray. A video review showed Murray’s shin hit the ground as he leaped for the marker, turning the ball over to the Lions.
Arizona had another fourth-down attempt near midfield in the fourth quarter, but it failed when Murray couldn’t connect with tight end Trey McBride.
“We never had that one explosive (play) in the run game and you’re waiting for one to pop,” Gannon said. “We knew it was going to be dirty, two or three yards, and were waiting for that one to pop. They did a good job.”

LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Raiders entered their matchup against the Browns with the NFL’s worst running game and without star players Maxx Crosby and Davante Adams.
Plus, Las Vegas was coming off a loss to the previously winless Panthers that drew the ire of coach Antonio Pierce.
But the Raiders found a balanced running attack and overcame a Cleveland rally to win 20-16 on Sunday.
“Yeah, a lot of adversity this week, there’s no doubt about it,” Raiders quarterback Gardner Minshew said. “I was happy to see how we responded. Coming in Friday’s practice, we kind of turned the corner and the overall mood of the team changed and everybody was feeling really it again.”
Cleveland drove to the Raiders 9-yard line with the chance to walk out with the victory, but Charles Snowden sacked Deshaun Watson on fourth down with 35 seconds left.
The Raiders (2-2) found enough offense without star wide receiver Adams (hamstring) and held the Browns to 241 yards without Crosby (ankle).
“We all had to take a step up,” Snowden said. “I have to thank Maxx. He was engaged all week coaching us up, being a very present figure.”
Alexander Mattison rushed for 60 yards for the Raiders, who totaled 152 on the ground and had five players with runs of at least 10 yards, their most since 2010 against the Seahawks. The Raiders got rushing touchdowns from receivers Tre Tucker and DJ Turner, becoming the first team since the Jets in 2010 to get two TD runs from wideouts.


Las Vegas hadn’t rushed for more than 55 yards in a game this season.
“It felt really good to be able to operate on all cylinders like that to get the run game going,” Mattison said. “The O-line did an amazing job. We have to keep it going because we know what we’re capable of.”

Minshew was 14 for 24 for 130 yards. He was sacked twice by reigning AP Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett, who is dealing with an assortment of injuries.
Watson completed all eight passes in leading the Browns to a touchdown on an opening drive that lasted 9:22, but he finished 24 for 32 for 176 yards.
He entered the game having taken a league-high 16 sacks, and the Raiders took him down three times. Cleveland’s offensive line was missing four starters for much of the game.
Although it’s not yet October, the Browns (1-3) took a blow to their playoff chances. Only 42 teams since the 1970 merger have made the postseason after opening 1-3.
A week earlier, Las Vegas lost 36-22 to the Panthers, prompting Pierce to question some players’ effort. Then the Raiders found themselves in a 10-0 hole in the first quarter.
Las Vegas scored the next 20 points to seemingly take control.
“I knew what group I had,” Pierce said. “That wasn’t the team (last week) that we’re accustomed to seeing. It was a trying week. It probably started with me and my comments and I apologized to (the players) for that. I don’t want to be a distraction in that way.”
Zamir White fumbled on the first play of the fourth quarter, and Browns safety Rodney McLeod returned it for a 25-yard TD to give Cleveland life. Dustin Hopkins missed the extra point, leaving the Browns down 20-16.
“They had the momentum at that point and we really needed to step up and get a takeaway,” Garrett said. “That’s what we were calling for in the huddle, and we answered the bell. That was an adrenaline shot.”
Cleveland appeared to take the lead on an 82-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Amari Cooper, but backup center Nick Harris was called for holding, and the Browns eventually punted.
On their last-gasp drive, with the Browns forced to go for the touchdown, Watson couldn’t attempt a pass on the decisive play.
Browns: C Ethan Pocic (ankle) went into the locker room in the first quarter, returned in the third and then left again. .... Cleveland was already missing RG Wyatt Teller (knee) and OTs Jedrick Wills Jr. (knee) and Jack Conklin (hamstring). ... LB Jordan Hicks (elbow) left in the second quarter. ...

PERRY, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Helene left an enormous path of destruction across Florida and the southeastern U.S. on Friday, killing at least 44 people, snapping towering oaks like twigs and tearing apart homes as rescue crews launched desperate missions to save people from floodwaters. 
Among those killed were three firefighters, a woman and her 1-month-old twins, and an 89-year-old woman whose house was struck by a falling tree. According to an Associated Press tally, the deaths occurred in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. 
The Category 4 hurricane knocked out power to some hospitals in southern Georgia, and Gov. Brian Kemp said authorities had to use chainsaws to clear debris and open up roads. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 kph) when it made landfall late Thursday in a sparsely populated region in Florida’s rural Big Bend area, home to fishing villages and vacation hideaways where the state’s panhandle and peninsula meet. 
Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in property damage.


The wreckage extended hundreds of miles northward to northeast Tennessee, where a “ dangerous rescue situation ” by helicopter unfolded after 54 people were moved to the roof of the Unicoi County Hospital as water rapidly flooded the facility. Everyone was rescued and no one was left at the hospital as of late Friday afternoon, Ballad Health said.


In North Carolina, a lake featured in the movie “Dirty Dancing” overtopped a dam and surrounding neighborhoods were evacuated, although there were no immediate concerns it would fail. People also were evacuated from Newport, Tennessee, a city of about 7,000 people, amid concerns about a dam near there, although officials later said the structure had not failed.
Tornadoes hit some areas, including one in Nash County, North Carolina, that critically injured four people.
Atlanta received a record 11.12 inches (28.24 centimeters) of rain in 48 hours, the most the city has seen in a two-day period since record keeping began in 1878, Georgia’s Office of the State Climatologist said on the social platform X. The previous mark of 9.59 inches (24.36 cm) was set in 1886. Some neighborhoods were so badly flooded that only car roofs could be seen poking above the water. 
Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful cyclones sometimes in a matter of hours.
When Laurie Lilliott pulled onto her street in Dekle Beach, Florida, after Helene plowed through, she couldn’t see the roofline of her home beyond the palm trees. It had collapsed, torn apart by the pounding storm surge, one corner still precariously propped up by a piling.
“It took me a long time to breathe,” Lilliott said. 
As she surveyed the damage, her name and phone number were still inked on her arm in permanent marker, an admonition by Taylor County officials to help identify recovered bodies in the storm’s aftermath. The community has taken direct hits from three hurricanes since August 2023.
All five who died in one Florida county were in neighborhoods where residents were told to evacuate, said Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff in Pinellas County in the St. Petersburg area. Some who stayed ended up having to hide in their attics to escape the rising water. He said the death toll could rise as crews go door-to-door in flooded areas.
More deaths were reported in Georgia and the Carolinas, including two South Carolina firefighters and a Georgia firefighter who died when trees struck their trucks. 
Video on social media showed sheets of rain and siding coming off buildings in Perry, Florida, near where the storm hit land. A news station showed a home that was overturned, and many communities established curfews.
Also in Perry, the hurricane peeled off the new roof of a church that was replaced after Hurricane Idalia last year. 
When the water hit knee-level in Kera O’Neil’s home in Hudson, Florida, she knew it was time to escape. 
“There’s a moment where you are thinking, ‘If this water rises above the level of the stove, we are not going to have not much room to breathe,’” she said, recalling how she and her sister waded through chest-deep water with one cat in a plastic carrier and another in a cardboard box.
President Joe Biden said he was praying for survivors, and the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency headed to the area. The agency deployed more than 1,500 workers, and they helped with 400 rescues by late morning. 
AP correspondent Jennifer King reports Helene is headed inland, bringing dangerous tropical storm-force winds and rain to the southeastern U.S.
In Tampa, some areas could be reached only by boat. 
Officials urged people who were trapped to call for rescuers and not tread floodwaters, warning they can be dangerous due to live wires, sewage, sharp objects and other debris.
More than 3 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas as of late Friday, according to poweroutage.us. The site also showed outages as far north as Ohio and Indiana due to Helene’s rapid northward movement throughout the day.
In Georgia, an electrical utility group warned of “catastrophic” damage to utility infrastructure, with more than 100 high voltage transmission lines damaged. And officials in South Carolina, where more than 40% of customers were without power, said crews had to cut their way through debris just to determine what was still standing in some places.
Preparing for a hurricaneJaime Hernandez, the emergency management director for Hollywood, on Florida’s Atlantic Coast, says his team encourages people to do three key things: make a plan, have an emergency kit and stay informed.
Preparing for a hurricane also includes getting supplies in advance, including nonperishable foods and water in case power is lost and supplies are low in the community. Preparedness also includes ensuring all medical items and medications are ready in case people are unable to leave their homes.
Emergency kit necessitiesThe rule of thumb is to have 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water per day per person for about seven days, Hernandez says. It’s also a good idea to have cash on hand since ATMs may not be working.
Evacuating ahead of a stormOfficials advise residents listen to their local emergency management officials, who will have the most updated information about evacuation zones.
These excerpts were originally published on July 2, 2024, in Hurricane season 2024 is here. Here’s how to stay prepared. 
The hurricane came ashore near the mouth of the Aucilla River, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of where Idalia hit last year at nearly the same ferocity. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the damage from Helene appears to be greater than the combined effects of Idalia and Hurricane Debby in August.
“It’s tough, and we understand that. We also understand that this is a resilient state,” DeSantis said at a news conference in storm-damaged St. Pete Beach.
Soon after it crossed over land, Helene weakened to a tropical storm and later a post-tropical cyclone. Forecasters said it continued to produce catastrophic flooding, and some areas received more than a foot of rain. 
A mudslide in the Appalachian Mountains washed out part of an interstate highway at the North Carolina-Tennessee state line. 
Another slide hit homes in North Carolina and occupants had to wait more than four hours to be rescued, said Ryan Cole, the emergency services assistant director in Buncombe County. His 911 center received more than 3,300 calls in eight hours Friday.
“This is something that we’re going to be dealing with for many days and weeks to come,” Cole said. 
Forecasters warned of flooding in North Carolina that could be worse than anything seen in the past century. Evacuations were underway and around 300 roads were closed statewide. The Connecticut Army National Guard sent a helicopter to help.
School districts and universities canceled classes. Florida airports that closed due to the storm reopened Friday. Inspectors were examining bridges and causeways along the Gulf Coast, the state’s transportation secretary said.
Helene also swamped parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, flooding streets and toppling trees as it brushed past the resort city of Cancun this week. It also knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses in western Cuba.
Helene was the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.

SEATTLE (AP) — Cal Raleigh hit his 32nd homer, Bryan Woo struck out eight in five innings and the Seattle Mariners beat the Oakland Athletics 2-0 on Friday night.
Mitch Garver also homered for the Mariners, a day after Seattle was eliminated from postseason contention. Oakland also was coming off an emotional day after playing its final scheduled home game at the Coliseum, a 3-2 victory over Texas.
Woo (9-3) allowed just three hits and a walk.
“It was kind of a weird 24 hours,” Woo said. “Knowing you’re out of it, but you still want to finish strong. For yourself, for the team, for the fans, for everybody. Everybody else deserves that out of you and so you’ve got to find it in yourself to give it everything you have.”
He has 101 strikeouts in 121 1/3 innings this season. This was the seventh time in his 22 starts he did not allow a run.
“He had five really strong today,” Mariners manager Dan Wilson said. “What an incredible season for another one of our young starters. I thought he had a great year, and threw the ball well tonight.”
Oakland starter JP Sears (11-13) allowed two runs on four hits over six innings.
The Mariners opened the final three-game series of the season after seeing their playoff hopes officially end on an off day, watching as the Royals and Tigers both won to knock out Seattle from wild-card contention.
The Mariners led the AL West by 10 games in June before hitting a skid and seeing the division lead evaporate over a month. A late surge gave Seattle some slight postseason hope that was finally extinguished Thursday.


Despite that, the crowd of 41,429 was relatively upbeat, especially when Garver gave Seattle a 1-0 lead with his 15th homer to lead off the second inning.
Raleigh added another run with his home run to center field in the third inning. Raleigh leads major league catchers with the 32 homers.
“Garv really crushed it, Cal crushed it,” Wilson said. “Those were big knocks and gave us what we needed tonight. Our pitching was really, really strong.”
Mariners relievers Gabe Speier, Gregory Santos, Tayler Saucedo and Troy Taylor each pitched an inning in Seattle’s 15th shutout of the season, with Taylor getting his first career save.
“That’s a big deal for him,” Wilson said. “He’s been given some higher leverage situations, and he’s been able to handle them. You’ve got to love that from a young kid. He’s another guy that really wants the ball in those situations, and that’s a good sign.”
The A’s reinstated RHP Ross Stripling from the IL before the game. Stripling had been on the 15-day IL since Sept. 11 because of a lower back strain. Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said Stripling would pitch out of the bullpen at some point in the series.
Seatle will call up RHP Emerson Hancock (4-4, 4.72 ERA) from Triple-A to start Saturday against Oakland. Hancock has made 11 starts for Seattle this season, most recently on September 21 against Texas. The Athletics were set to start RHP Joey Estes (7-9, 4.99 ERA).

ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Severe flooding in northeastern Nigeria has left 30 people dead and affected more than a million others, authorities said on Wednesday.
The collapse of a major dam in the state of Borno on Tuesday caused some of the state’s worst flooding since the same dam collapsed 30 years ago, and prompted many residents to flee their homes. The state government said the dam was at capacity due to unusually high rains.
The current flooding comes nearly two years after Nigeria’s worst flooding in a decade killed more than 600 people across the country. 
About 15% of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, was under water, state police spokesperson Nahum Daso told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
Ezekiel Manzo, spokesperson of National Emergency Management Agency, said Wednesday that the death toll is 30.
“One million people have been affected so far,” said an aide for the governor of Borno, adding that as efforts to document displaced people begin, that number could rise to up to 2 million.
Residents of Maiduguri said that food has become expensive since the central market was destroyed during the flooding. There are also ongoing fears of wildlife after the flooding partially destroyed a local zoo and several of the animals escaped. 
Mary Mamza, a Maiduguri resident, said people are afraid to leave their homes after an escaped crocodile was killed near her home earlier today. 


These fears come as West Africa has experienced some of its worst flooding in decades. Over 2.3 million people have been affected by flooding so far this year which is a threefold increase from last year according to the UN. 
African nations are losing up to 5% of their GDP every year as they bear a heavier burden than the rest of the world from climate change, a new report said Monday after one of the continent’s hottest years on record.
The World Meteorological Organization said many African nations are spending up to 9% of their budgets for climate adaptation policies.
The aide of the governor stressed that rescue operations were still underway and that people displaced by the flooding are gathering at a former refugee camp outside the flood zone.",False

MAINEVILLE, Ohio (AP) — Lydia Ko extended her amazing summer run when she turned a two-shot deficit into a rout by closing with a 9-under 63 to win the Kroger Queen City Championship for her third LPGA Tour title of the season.
Ko won for the third time in her last four starts, which includes her Olympic gold medal that gave the 27-year-old from New Zealand enough points for the LPGA Hall of Fame.
It also includes another major in the Women’s British Open, this one at St. Andrews.
“It’s been pretty surreal,” Ko said after her five-shot victory at the TPC River’s Bend over Jeeno Thitikul, who closed with a 70 and simply couldn’t keep up.
Thitikul was two shots ahead after eight holes of the final round. Three holes later, the Thai was chasing the hottest player in women’s golf.
Thitikul made bogey on the par-4 ninth. Ko made a 10-foot birdie putt on the 10th hole to tie for the lead, and then pulled ahead by two shots with a 12-foot eagle putt on the par-5 11th.
Ko seized control for good with a pair of two-shot swings — she made birdie and Thitikul made bogey on the 13th and 15th holes.
Thitikul two-putted for birdie on the par-5 closing hole to at least finish alone in second, one shot ahead of Haeran Ryu (67).
“It’s just like insane — it’s super insane. Her putter was on fire today,” Thitikul said of playing alongside Ko. “I respect her as like my older sister, as a legend, and also as my role model. It was such a really good experience watching her in my eyes on the same tee box, on the same greens, just like VIP seat.”


Nelly Korda, the No. 1 player in women’s golf who still has a comfortable lead in the Race to CME Globe with her six victories this year, had a 68 and tied for fifth, nine shots behind.
Ko, who finished at 23-under 265, now has 22 career LPGA victories. It was the fifth time she has at least three wins in the same season on the LPGA, her biggest year coming with five wins when she was 18 and reached No. 1 in the world.
Ko also won the season opener in Florida in January, but there were times early in the summer when she wondered if she would ever get the final victory needed for the LPGA Hall of Fame.
She took care of that with Olympic gold in Paris, won at St. Andrews for her third major and, after a three-week break, picked up as though nothing had changed.
“I had the most unbelievable three weeks in Europe. And now after having another three weeks off here, not entirely sure what it’s going to be like,” Ko said. 
She was two shots behind Thitikul going into the final round and was expecting Thitikul to keep going strong. The Thai did, but she fell back with bogeys on the ninth, 13th and 15th holes and Ko was on her way to another victory.
Ko had the low round of the week at the TPC River’s Bend, which was used this year while Kenwood Country Club goes through some course improvements.
“To have a round like this to cap off a win is pretty special,” she said.
Ko next week heads to South Korea to play in the Hana Financial Group Championship. It will be a chance for her to reach 30 career titles worldwide, including victories on the Korea LPGA, the Ladies European Tour and the ALPG Tour in Australia.

Publication date:2024-09-22 07:00:00

NEW YORK (AP) — Pete Alonso stepped up to the plate in the first inning of what could be his final home game at Citi Field and was met by a huge ovation.
“Are you going to tip you cap or something?” Alonso recalled home plate umpire John Libka telling him. “I can give you time right here.”
“Oh, yeah,” Alonso told him. “I was really happy that John reminded me.”
Alonso waved his helmet to the sellout crowd of 43,139, then tapped his helmet to his heart after the first of several standing ovations. 
“It’s wild. It’s something you just really — you kind of hear about or read about or kind of see in movies,” Alonso said.
Alonso went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts in the Mets’ 2-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday night. With a week left in the season, New York is in position for the second NL wild card and two games ahead of Atlanta for the final postseason berth.
“This what this is what our identity is,” Alonso said. “We fight and scratch for every pitch, every out. A game like today really shows the character and who we are, who the 2024 Mets are.”
Alonso is hitting .244 with 31 homers and 86 RBIs. The 29-year-old has a $20.5 million, one-year contract, can become a free agent after the World Series and is represented by Scott Boras, an agent known for testing the market.
“POLAR BEAR PLEASE STAY” and “SAVE THE POLAR BEAR” said a pair of hand-held signs, referring to Alonso’s nickname.


“That’s what makes this city such a special city,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. “I got goosebumps when that happened.”
A four-time All-Star who’s been a fan favorite since hitting 53 homers in 2019 and winning NL Rookie of the Year, Alonso says he’s not thinking about free agency and is concentrating on winning his first World Series title, which would be the Mets’ first since 1986.
“We got some more meat left on the bone of this,” he said. “We still have work to do and we need to finish.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Marina Mabrey scored 20 points and Alyssa Thomas added 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists and the Connecticut Sun defeated the Minnesota Lynx 73-70 on Sunday night in Game 1 of their semifinals series.
DiJonai Carrington had 13 points and DeWanna Bonner had 10 points and 11 boards for the Sun.
Napheesa Collier, who averaged 40 points in the first round of the playoffs, led Minnesota with 19 points and nine rebounds. Bridget Carleton scored 17 and Kayla McBride added 12.
Game 2 of the best-of-5 series will be played Tuesday in Minneapolis.
“It’s a long series for a reason. We have all the faith in the world that we’ll perform better on Tuesday night and hopefully come out with a win,” Carleton said.
In their first-round sweep of Phoenix, the Lynx shot 50% from the floor and 40% from the arc, topping 100 points in both games.
It was a different story against the Sun, who had the stingiest defense in the league this season. Minnesota shot just 41.5% from the field and made 5 of 20 3-point attempts. In the fourth quarter, the Lynx shot 4 for 18 from the field and scored just eight points.
“That’s just what our group does. This is a team and a franchise ... that has hung our hats on defense,” Sun coach Stephanie White said. “We had to be disruptive. We had to try to force them into uncomfortable shots.” 
Mabrey opened the fourth with her sixth 3-pointer of the night, and Carrington scored on a putback to tie the score 62-all with seven minutes to play. Bonner hit a corner 3 and added a transition layup after blocking a Collier shot as the Sun crept ahead by three.


After the Lynx were held without a basket for more than three minutes, Collier’s driving layup cut the Sun’s lead to 71-70 with 33.9 seconds to go.
However, Thomas hit a 15-foot jumper with 11.7 seconds left and after a disjointed final possession, Collier’s desperation 3-pointer came up short.
“We had a couple things going, not necessarily for (Collier),” Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said. “The options that we were looking for weren’t available, so at that point we were just trying to find a 3.” 
The Sun won two of their three games against the Lynx this season — one in overtime, the other by five points — while the Lynx won by two points on Sept. 17 when Carleton sank a long three to win it.
“All season long it’s been a physical series. Every game has come down to the wire in the fourth quarter and we expected nothing less,” Thomas said. “We’re two of the top defensive teams for a reason.”
The Lynx trailed by four entering the third quarter, when McBride hit a 3-pointer and a long jumper on back-to-back possessions to erase the deficit. Tied at 57 in the final minute of the quarter, Myisha Hines-Allen scored on a baseline drive, then after getting a stop on the other end, Williams drained a 3 to give Minnesota a 62-57 lead after three quarters. 
Connecticut used a 9-0 run late in the first quarter to jump out to a 23-14 lead. Carrington sparked the rally by converting a turnover into a breakaway layup and hitting a corner 3 the next time down the court.
Minnesota clawed back in the second quarter, as Williams’ steal and fast-break assist to McBride sparked a 15-0 spurt that gave the Lynx a 35-29 lead. Carleton hit a pair of 3s and Alanna Smith converted a three-point play over that four-minute stretch, which Mabrey snapped with a 3 from the wing.
Mabrey’s bucket triggered a 13-2 run that ended with another Mabrey 3 as the Sun took a 42-38 lead into the half.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gavin Lux singled in the go-ahead run with two outs in the seventh inning and the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied after blowing a 7-3 lead to beat the Chicago Cubs 10-8 on Wednesday night and avoid a series sweep.
Shohei Ohtani hit his 47th home run and stole his 48th base while three other Dodgers went deep in the first inning for the NL West leaders, whose magic number to clinch the division dropped to 11 after San Diego lost at Seattle.
The Dodgers walked 10 batters, including four by starter Bobby Miller.
“It was frustrating again, but it’s baseball. Not everything is going to be clicking at the same time,” third baseman Max Muncy said. “We had guys battling up there and it was good to see everyone not giving up.”
Switch hitting Tommy Edman homered for the fourth time in 24 hours. His two-out, two-run shot off Trey Wingenter in the eighth extended the Dodgers’ lead to 10-7. He also went deep in the first from the right side and later from the left, the first time he’s homered from both sides in the same game. 
“Tommy is otherworldly these days,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. 
Trailing by three, the Cubs threatened in the ninth. Michael Kopech loaded the bases on consecutive walks to Dansby Swanson, Seiya Suzuki and former Dodger Cody Bellinger.
Kopech was called for a pitch-clock violation, giving an automatic ball to Isaac Paredes, whose sacrifice fly cut Chicago’s deficit to 10-8. Suzuki was thrown out trying to steal third and former Dodger Michael Busch struck out swinging to end the game as Kopech eked out his 13th save.


Alex Vesia (3-4) got the win with one inning of relief. 
The Cubs outscored the Dodgers 16-7 in winning the first two games. They took the season series, 4-2.
The Dodgers blew a lead for the second straight game. They were ahead 3-1 on Tuesday and lost 6-3. After their big first inning Wednesday, they eventually led 7-3 only to watch the Cubs tie it in the fifth.
Will Smith doubled off Shawn Armstrong (3-3) in the seventh and scored on Lux’s single to center, putting the Dodgers back in front, 8-7.
Miller put the Dodgers in a 2-0 hole in the first. He gave up back-to-back, two-out walks before Paredes and Busch drove in runs.
The Dodgers answered with four homers in the bottom of the inning to take a 5-2 lead. 
Ohtani moved closer to becoming the first player in major league history with 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. He led off with a 405-foot shot to center and then walked and stole second in the second.
“Every night I feel like he does something that we haven’t seen,” Muncy said, citing the 118 mph exit velocity with a launch angle of 19 degrees on Ohtani’s homer. “I feel sorry for the fan that tried to catch it.” 
After two outs, Teoscar Hernández singled and scored on Edman’s homer into the left-field pavilion on the first pitch. Edman homered twice on two pitches against the Cubs on Tuesday.
Smith followed with a 404-foot shot to nearly the same spot in left. Muncy came up next and sent a towering 401-foot blast to right field on his bobblehead night.
Bellinger hit a three-run shot in the fifth that chased Miller and left Chicago trailing 7-6. The Cubs loaded the bases on two walks by Daniel Hudson and an error by second baseman Chris Taylor before Pete Crow-Armstrong’s RBI single tied it 7-7.
Trying to make his case for a postseason roster spot, Miller gave up six runs, including his 16th homer, and five hits in 4 1/3 innings. The right-hander’s ERA ballooned to 8.17. He struck out two and walked four, including three with two outs.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress on Wednesday passed a temporary measure that keeps government agencies funded into December, avoiding a shutdown for now while punting final spending decisions until after the Nov. 5 election.
The Senate approved the measure by a vote of 78-18 shortly after the House easily approved it. The bill generally funds agencies at current levels through Dec. 20. But an additional $231 million was included to bolster the Secret Service after the two assassination attempts against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Money was also added to aid with the presidential transition, among other things. 
The bill now goes to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.
“This bipartisanship is a good outcome for America,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said moments before the vote. “I hope it sets the tone for more constructive, bipartisan work when we return in the fall.”
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., billed the measure as doing “only what’s absolutely necessary,” a statement directed at members of his own conference concerned about spending levels. 
Still, it was a no-go for some Republicans, which forced House GOP leadership to rely on Democratic votes to pass the bill through a process that requires at least two-thirds support from voting members. The final vote was 341-82, with Republicans supplying all the no votes in both chambers. Johnson said the only alternative to the continuing resolution at this stage would have been a government shutdown.
Congress is moving quickly to avoid a government shutdown just weeks before the Nov. 5 election. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.
“It would be political malpractice to shut the government down,” Johnson said. “I think everyone understands that.”


The House floor was largely empty during debate on the measure. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, was the lone critic among the speakers, saying, “We end up in a vicious circle every year, the same vicious circle.” 
Lawmakers in both chambers are anxious to return to their home states and districts to campaign, smoothing the path for passage of the temporary funding fix. But more arduous fiscal negotiations await them at the end of the year.
Under terms of a previous deal to avoid a federal default and allow the government to continue paying its bills, spending for defense and nondefense programs would rise 1% next year.
The Senate has been charting a course to go above that level, while House Republicans have been voting for steep cuts to many nondefense programs, and they have attached policy mandates to the spending bills that Democrats overwhelmingly oppose. So a final agreement will be difficult to reach.
In the meantime, the temporary bill will mostly fund the government at current levels, with a few exceptions like the funding infusion for the Secret Service.
The $231 million for the Secret Service does come with strings attached. It’s contingent upon the agency complying with congressional oversight. The bill also allows the Secret Service to spend its allocations faster if needed.
“Everybody understands that’s critically important right now,” Johnson said of the Secret Service money. 
Trump thanked lawmakers for the extra Secret Service funding at a campaign event Wednesday. He had earlier called on Republicans not to move forward on a spending bill without also including a requirement that people provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. That legislation failed in the House last week.
In a recent letter, the Secret Service told lawmakers that a funding shortfall was not the reason for lapses in Trump’s security when a gunman climbed onto an unsecured roof on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and opened fire. But acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., also made clear the agency had “immediate needs” and that he’s talking to Congress.
“The Secret Service has asked for this additional funding. It’s absolutely essential as they deal with the increased threat environment,” said Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The continuing resolution is needed because Congress is nowhere close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that fund much of the federal government. The House has passed five of the 12 bills, mostly along party lines. The Senate has passed zero. 
Republicans blame the impasse on Senate Democrats for not putting the dozen appropriations bills on the Senate floor for a vote, where they then could be reconciled with the House bills during negotiations. But Democrats counter that House Republicans are acting in bad faith, bogging the process down by undercutting the agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy negotiated with the White House over spending caps for the 2024 and 2025 budget years.
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee, said her party will accept nothing less than the 1% increase specified in that agreement. Also, if Republicans seek more than that for defense, there must be “dollar for dollar parity for nondefense,” she said. 
The White House called on both chambers to pass the stopgap bill, while cautioning that it did not provide adequate funding to help communities recover from natural disasters and failed to include enough funding for health care provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Johnson warned that when the temporary extension expires in December, he will not support a massive, catchall bill to fund the government, referred to as an omnibus, so another stopgap may be needed that would allow the new president and Congress to have the final say on fiscal year 2025 spending levels. 
“I have no intention of going back to that terrible tradition,” Johnson said.
Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, urged House Republicans not to “follow the loudest voices on the far right” in the negotiations for the full-year bill. 
“You cannot strike a deal to govern with people who do not really want to govern,” Murray said.",False

Publication date:2024-09-24 21:58:00

CHESTER-LE-STREET, England (AP) — England captain Harry Brook struck his first one-day international century before his team clinched a 46-run win by the DLS method to keep alive the series against Australia on Tuesday.
Chasing 305 to win the third ODI, England was 254-4 — with Brook unbeaten on 110 — when heavy rain arrived in the day-nighter at Chester-le-Street. The teams didn’t get back on the field and England was well ahead of the run-rate.
Australia, which had cruised to dominant wins at Southampton and Leeds in this five-match series, saw its lead trimmed to 2-1 and its 14-match winning run in ODIs come to an end. During that streak, the team won the Cricket World Cup in India last year.
Coming to the crease with England in trouble on 11-2, Brook took on Australia’s seam attack by hitting 13 fours and two sixes in a 94-ball knock to easily surpass his previous ODI-best score of 80.
“I’m relieved, for sure. It’s just nice to see some rewards,” said Brook, who gained his first win as stand-in skipper for the injured Jos Buttler. “I’m just glad I managed to play the way I wanted to. It’s nice to get that first hundred on the board and hopefully there’s plenty more to come.
“I feel like I’ve been a little bit stop-start this summer. I’ve had a lot of starts — 30s and 40s — and then not managed to convert, which is frustrating. To do that today, I feel like I’m back in a good place.”


The series continues on Friday with the fourth ODI at Lord’s.
Playing without explosive opener Travis Head (rested) and star spinner Adam Zampa (ill), Australia was put into bat and needed a strong finish — mainly thanks to Alex Carey’s unbeaten 77 and No. 8 batter Aaron Hardie’s 44 off 26 — to post 304-7 off its 50 overs.
Steve Smith hit a patient 60 off 82 balls, after the tourists’ innings was slowed by losing Cameron Green (42) and Marnus Labuschagne (0) in space of five balls just past the halfway mark.
It looked a tough chase for a youthful England team that had been outclassed so far this series and things started badly when Mitchell Starc dismissed Phil Salt (for an eight-ball duck) and Ben Duckett (8) in the same over — Australia’s third.
Brook embraced the pressure of the occasion and went on the attack pretty much from the start of his innings.
His third-wicket stand of 156 with Will Jacks (84 off 82 balls) swung the momentum England’s way and the team maintained it when the big-hitting Liam Livingstone came in at No. 6 and immediately smashed two sixes.
Brook used the uppercut to great effect to deal with some short-pitched bowling from the Australians and hit a straight drive for four to get to 99. Off the next ball, he opened the face and edged for another four to reach his century, prompting him to remove his helmet and look to the sky.
Brook’s second fifty came off just 33 deliveries.
England’s push for victory was then held up by the rain that arrived in the 38th over. It got heavier and heavier, with the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern formula showing that the hosts were well in front of the run-rate.
Brook made some interesting comments after the series opener in Nottingham, reflecting on some loose dismissals by saying: “If you get caught somewhere on the boundary or in the field, then who cares?”
He said his words had been misunderstood.
“I think people took that a little bit the wrong way. You’ve got to go out and play fearlessly and almost have that ‘who cares?’ attitude. But that’s not a ‘who cares if we lose?’ attitude,” Brook said.
“We all want to win, but you don’t want to go out and have that fear of getting out.”

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Two transgender girls can try out for and play on girls school sports teams while the teens challenge a New Hampshire ban, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. 
The families of Parker Tirrell, 15, and Iris Turmelle, 14, sued in August seeking to overturn the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act that Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law in July. While Turmelle doesn’t plan to play sports until December, Tirrell successfully sought an emergency order allowing her to start soccer practice last month. That order was expiring Tuesday. 
In issuing a preliminary injunction, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Landya McCafferty found Tirrell and Turmelle were likely to succeed in their lawsuit. She found that the students “demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm” in the absence of a preliminary order. 
Before the law was enacted, “Parker had been participating in girls’ sports at Plymouth Elementary School and Plymouth Regional High School, and Iris had participated in tennis and tried out for her middle school softball team,” McCafferty wrote. “There is no indication in the record that plaintiffs’ participation in school sports has caused the state or anyone else the slightest modicum of harm.” 
McCafferty noted that at a hearing last month, she brought up the possibility of a trial this fall, before winter track season starts for Turmelle. An attorney representing the students said he would be ready for a trial; an attorney for the state did not indicate that. 
McCafferty wrote Tuesday that a trial would almost certainly occur well after December. 


“We are currently reviewing the court’s decision and are in the process of evaluating the implications of the ruling,” Michael Garrity, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire attorney general’s office, said in a news release. “We remain dedicated to providing a safe environment for all students. The state will continue to consider all legal avenues to ensure that we uphold both the law and our commitment to student welfare.”
A message seeking comment was sent to GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, which represents the students. 
McCafferty’s ruling came a day after a federal appeals court upheld a lower-court ruling that blocks Arizona from enforcing a 2022 ban on transgender girls from playing on girls school sports teams.
The New Hampshire lawsuit says the state’s ban violates constitutional protections and federal laws because the teens are being denied equal educational opportunities and are being discriminated against because they are transgender.
Lawyers for the state said the teens’ lawyers haven’t proven their case and haven’t shown why alternatives, such as participating in coed teams, couldn’t be an option.
The bill signed by Sununu bans transgender athletes in grades 5 to 12 from teams that align with their gender identity. It require schools to designate all teams as either girls, boys or coed, with eligibility determined based on students’ birth certificates “or other evidence.”
Sununu had said it “ensures fairness and safety in women’s sports by maintaining integrity and competitive balance in athletic competitions.” About half of states have adopted similar measures.
The rights of transgender people — especially young people — have become a major political battleground in recent years as trans visibility has increased. Most Republican-controlled states have banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, and several have adopted policies limiting which school bathrooms trans people can use and barring trans girls from some sports competitions.",False

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — 
Bill O’Brien cautioned it was just one win. What a massive first win of 2024 it was for Boston College — and for the O’Brien Era.
Treshaun Ward totaled 138 yards of offense, including a 13-yard touchdown reception, against his former team as Boston College stunned No. 10 Florida State 28-13 on Monday night.
Ward, a Tampa native who played at Florida State from 2019-22, had 77 yards rushing and 61 yards receiving as the Eagles (1-0, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) totaled 263 yards rushing.
It was a resounding debut for O’Brien, who was introduced in mid-February after Jeff Hafley’s departure to become the Green Bay Packers’ defensive coordinator.
“I’m very proud of these guys,” O’Brien said. “They were resilient tonight. To come down here against a team that really in their minds had to have this win, that’s a heck of a statement for BC. But it’s just one win.”
The Eagles’ offense produced touchdown drives of 71 yards, 68 yards and 60 yards. BC defensive back Max Tucker also intercepted DJ Uiagalelei and his 58-yard return set up the Eagles on FSU’s goal line for another touchdown.
Florida State had won five straight in the series but was overmatched on offense and defense in this one.
The Seminoles, viewed as a contender for a spot in the 12-team College Football Playoff, dropped to 0-2 for the first time since 2021.
“Sick to how this season started,” Florida State coach Mike Norvell said. “I failed in preparing the team to be able to go out and respond tonight.”


Uiagalelei completed 21 of 42 passes for 272 yards and a 29-yard touchdown pass to Kentron Poitier in the third quarter, cutting BC’s lead to 21-13.
But BC responded on the next drive, marching 60 yards in 12 plays as Kye Robichaux’s 2-yard TD run gave the Eagles a 28-13 lead with 1:03 left in the third quarter.
Florida State scored on just one of six second-half drives.
Thomas Castellanos nearly pulled off an upset of Florida State in 2023, throwing for 305 yards and rushing for 95 yards as well as a touchdown passing and rushing in a 31-29 loss. While not as prolific on Monday, the BC quarterback completed 10 of 16 passes for 106 yards and two touchdowns to go with 73 yards rushing and a 4-yard touchdown run.
“Everything we did this offseason, from a winter workout, summer workout, it led up to this,” Castellanos said. “This is what we prepared for. It all panned out.”
BC played without Logan Taylor, who started 12 games at Virginia in 2023. Taylor had 23 career starts.
Florida State played without starting right tackle Jeremiah Byers and two reserve linebackers, Omar Graham Jr. and Shawn Murphy, on Monday. Wide receiver Hykeem Williams missed his second straight game. None of the injuries were specified.
Florida State is almost certain to tumble out of the top 25 following its two losses to open the season.
Boston College: The Eagles averaged 5.4 yards per play and converted on 9 of 16 third-down opportunities to build the upset.
Florida State: A strength going into the season has instead been a weakness. The Seminoles had just 21 yards rushing on 16 carries.
Boston College hosts Duquesne on Saturday.
Florida State has a bye week and next hosts Memphis on Sept. 14.

Western Kentucky (3-1) at Boston College (3-1), Saturday, 12 p.m. ET (ACCN)
BetMGM College Football Odds: Boston College by 12½.
Series record: First meeting.
Boston College could get back into The Associated Press Top 25 with a convincing win – if a couple of ranked teams stumble. BC sneaked into the rankings at No. 24 after starting the season with victories over 10th-ranked Florida State and FCS Duquesne. But it lasted only one week because of a loss to No. 6 Missouri. The Hilltoppers have won three straight since their only loss, to No. 5 Alabama.
Hilltoppers QB Caden Veltkamp made his first career start against Toledo last week and completed 20 of 30 passes for 242 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 20 yards and two TDs. BC LB Donovan Ezeiruaku, a 2022 All-ACC pick, has 19 tackles and is tied for second in the ACC with five sacks.
Western Kentucky: DB Devonte’ Mathews had two red zone interceptions in the final two minutes of last week’s victory over Toledo. The second was at the WKU 1 yard-line with 18 seconds left to clinch the win. Mathews had four tackles in the 26-21 victory.
Boston College: RB Kye Robichaux started his college career at Western Kentucky, running for 828 yards in two seasons before transferring. He ran for 780 yards and eight touchdowns last year and had 85 yards and a score – and added a touchdown catch – in the Week 1 victory over the Seminoles.


BC QB Thomas Castellanos is eighth in FBS (and third in the ACC) with a 193.2 passer rating. He is 10th with 16.2 yards per completion and 13th with 10 passing touchdowns. … Ezeiruaku has 18.5 career sacks, tied with Zach Allen and Sean Guthrie for sixth all-time at BC. … Lewis Bond was the ACC wide receiver of the week after his second career 100-yard game, including the game-winning touchdown against Michigan State. … WKU P Cole Maynard was named CUSA Special Teams Player of the Week after the win over Toledo. He averaged 50.8 yards on six punts. With under a minute to play in the third quarter, he pinned Toledo at its own 2-yard line. The WKU defense recorded a safety on the next play, kicking off a stretch of 16 unanswered points in the comeback victory. … In the Hilltoppers’ FBS era, which began in 2009, they have beaten power conference opponents Arkansas (2019), Vanderbilt (2015), Kentucky (2012 and ’13).

Publication date:2024-09-04 07:00:00

PARIS (AP) — Fadi Aldeeb got the competing out of the way early at the Paralympic Games. He’s been using the rest of the time to talk.
The only Paralympian in the Palestinian delegation in Paris, Aldeeb feels he bears special responsibility to represent all Palestinians living in Gaza, the West Bank and elsewhere. He tries not to think about his own situation.
“I’m their voice. And I want to talk and talk and talk,” the Gaza native told The Associated Press in an interview this week.
The 40-year-old Aldeeb, who uses a wheelchair, was the Palestinian flag bearer during the Games’ opening ceremony, two days before he placed last in the men’s shot put for seated athletes with a season best throw of 8.81 meters.
The winner, world record holder Ruzhdi Ruzhdi, returned to Bulgaria with his gold medal, but Aldeeb has stayed around the Paralympic Village, speaking to media about the desperate situation in his homeland following Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages.
After nearly 11 months of fighting, the war has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who say about half of the dead are women and children. It has displaced the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. It has plunged the besieged territory into a humanitarian catastrophe, including new fears of a polio outbreak.
Aldeeb said he lost his younger brother on Dec. 6 when the building containing the family home in the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah was bombed and destroyed.


Aldeeb, who besides competing in shot put is a professional wheelchair basketball player, was playing a French league match and only saw afterward he’d received many missed calls from the brother. There was no connection when he tried calling back. Another brother told him the next day he had been killed.
Aldeeb said it made him question why he plays sport. He said the image of his brother comes to him at night and he often wonders what he was trying to say when he called during the league match.
“I received a call from his daughter, she’s like, 7 years old. I never ever can forget this,” Aldeeb said, fighting tears. “She asked me, ‘My uncle, I know he’s died and he goes – Inshallah – to Jannah, but I want his body. I don’t need his body to stay under the building, and the dogs start eating his body.’ Imagine, a child 7 years old, speaking like this.”
Aldeeb said other family members decided to scatter around the Gaza Strip to maximize their chances of survival.
“If they stay together, it’s all too easy that all of this family disappears and is killed,” he said.
Aldeeb said he hasn’t seen his own wife and children for two years because they’re still in Turkey, where he moved from Gaza in 2016 to play basketball. They can’t get a visa to join him in France, and he says he can’t get a visa to join them in Turkey without going to Gaza.
“Sometimes, you keep your feelings inside of yourself because you don’t want to show yourself, like, weak or something like that. You want to keep going because you have a big goal. You want to have it, but at the same time when you’re alone, yeah, you’re crying, you’re human,” he said.
Aldeeb said he received his life-changing injury on Oct. 4, 2001. He said he was shot in the back by an Israeli sniper when soldiers responded with bullets after some kids threw stones at an Israeli tank.
The current war is creating many more potential Paralympians, but Aldeeb said all Palestinian athletes face a lack of facilities and equipment – and difficulties leaving. 
The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended military rule, and Gaza’s borders have been sealed for months. Even before the war, athletes struggled to leave the territory for international competitions because of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after the Hamas militant group seized power in 2007.
Aldeeb wants to see future Palestinian delegations at Paralympic and Olympic competitions grow.
“We have in Gaza something the world doesn’t have – the type of players, the type of athletes. What they need are just little programs. You cannot imagine what they can do,” Aldeeb said. “I hope they can get this opportunity before they are killed, I hope.”

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The Republican Party sued North Carolina’s elections board on Thursday to block students and employees at the state’s flagship public university from offering a digital identification as a way to comply with a relatively new photo voter ID law.
The Republican National Committee and North Carolina filed the lawsuit in Wake County Superior Court three weeks after the Democratic majority on the State Board of Elections approved the “Mobile UNC One Card” generated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a qualifying ID. 
The law says qualifying IDs must meet several photo and security requirements to be approved by the board. The UNC-Chapel Hill digital ID, which is voluntary for students and staff and available on Apple phones, marks the qualification of the first such ID posted from someone’s smartphone. 
The Republican groups said state law clearly requires any of several categories of permitted identifications — from driver’s licenses to U.S. passports and university and military IDs — to be only in a physical form. 
The law doesn’t allow the state board “to expand the circumstances of what is an acceptable student identification card, beyond a tangible, physical item, to something only found on a computer system,” the lawsuit reads. 
The state and national GOP contend in the lawsuit that the board’s unilateral expansion of photo ID before registering and accepting voters at in-person poll sites “could allow hundreds or thousands of ineligible voters” to vote in the November election and beyond. North Carolina is a presidential battleground state where statewide races are usually very close. 


An electronically stored photo ID may be easier to alter than a physical card and more difficult for a precinct worker to review, including when there are computer network problems, the lawsuit says. The groups also filed a separate request for a judge to issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction preventing the use of the mobile ID. 
In response to an email seeking a response to the lawsuit, a state board spokesperson pointed late Thursday to the board’s discussion at its Aug. 20 meeting. 
A board attorney said during the meeting there was nothing in the law that specifically limits approval to printed cards. Board Chair Alan Hirsch, a Democrat, cited trends in technology in giving the ID his OK, saying that airline passengers now show boarding passes from their smartphones. 
The current voter ID law was initially approved in late 2018. But it didn’t get carried out until the 2023 municipal elections as legal challenges continued. 
The board has OK’d over 130 traditional student and employee IDs as qualifying for voting purposes in 2024, including UNC-Chapel Hill’s physical One Card. Someone who can’t show a qualifying ID casts a provisional ballot and either fills out an exception form or provides an ID before ballot counts are complete. In-person early voting begins Oct. 17.
People casting traditional absentee ballots also are asked to put a copy of an ID into their envelope. A board official said that UNC-Chapel Hill voters with the One Card can now insert a photocopy of the One Card displayed on their phones to meet the requirement. 
The first absentee ballots were supposed to be distributed to voters who had requested one starting Sept. 6. But appeals court rulings declaring that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name must be removed are forcing county elections official to reprint ballots. No new date for the start of the distribution of absentee ballots has been announced.",False

TOKYO (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping is reported to be a big soccer fan, and he promised in a 2015 document to resuscitate the men’s national team, damaged by abysmal results on the global stage and widespread corruption in local leagues. 
He cannot be happy.
Japan defeated China 7-0 on Thursday in a World Cup qualifier in Saitama, Japan, a brutal loss that came against one of China’s biggest sports and geopolitcal rivals in Asia. It was China’s most lopsided loss against Japan, and a historic loss in World Cup qualifying.
China’s national team coach Branko Ivankovic of Croatia called it a “most difficult night,” as quoted in English by the official Xinhua news agency, which termed the loss “humiliating.”
Wataru Endo and Kaoru Mitoma scored in the first half on a night of Asian World Cup qualifiers. Takumi Minamino scored twice in the second half with others from Daizen Maeda, Junya Ito and Takefusa Kubo.
“It was a tough match,” Xinhua quoted Ivankovic as saying. “And as a coach, this was the most difficult night for me.”
Reaction in China was muted on state media. The China Sports Daily had a very short story titled: “China lost to Japan in World Cup qualifier” with few details.
But there was more discussion on Chinese social media.
Zhang Feng, a journalist and commentator with a popular blog, was direct.
“Football cannot be boosted by singing odes, or telling stories,” he wrote. “It needs skill, and physical and tactical training. It cannot be accomplished through politics.”


Tang Yinghong. a prolific writer with a large following, suggested football is not a good fit for China, which won 40 gold medals in the recent Paris Olympics to tie the United States. Some were in sports like diving and others that do not have a large global following.
“In my opinion, let’s just let football develop on its own,” Tang wrote. “Leaders should not place high hopes on the sport, and the government needn’t give it a lot of care.”
China has nine more qualifying matches remaining, and still has a shot at reaching the expanded, 48-team World Cup in 2026, hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. But even with the larger and weakened field, China still might not make it.
China has qualified only once for the World Cup. It lost all three matches in 2002 and failed to score a goal.
China is No. 87 in the most recent FIFA rankings for men’s teams, just below the Caribbean island of Curaçao (population 150,000), and just above the African nation of Equatorial Guinea (1.7 million). China’s population is about 1.4 billion.

The Oklahoma Sooners and Auburn Tigers both are trying to bounce back from 10-point losses in their Southeastern Conference openers where turnovers proved costly and backup quarterbacks were called upon in the second half.
The similarities don’t go much beyond that.
Coach Brent Venables has already said the 21st-ranked Sooners (3-1, 0-1 SEC) are turning to freshman quarterback Michael Hawkins Jr. for his first college start Saturday against the Tigers (2-2, 0-1).
Hawkins replaced former five-star recruit Jackson Arnold in the second half of that 25-15 loss to Tennessee and the Sooners did close the gap. Arnold had three first-half turnovers.
“We didn’t want it to hang over anyone’s head and have speculation kind of create an additional story,” Venables said. “Mike’s a really talented guy, can really spin it. Makes quick decisions and is really athletic.
“Still believe in Jackson. It’s just the right thing to do in this moment.”
Auburn coach Hugh Freeze has bigger problems. He had already benched starter Payton Thorne after a four-interception game in a loss to California. He then called on second-year freshman Hank Brown against New Mexico and Arkansas but benched him after three first-half interceptions in the 24-14 loss to the Razorbacks.
He hasn’t said who’s starting this one, but the more experienced Thorne had a solid second half.
“What really went into that decision was that I experienced that two weeks earlier and I wasn’t going to continue down that road,” Freeze said. “It has nothing to do with my confidence in Hank. But in that moment, our team needed something else to try to give us a shot.”


Hawkins provided the Sooners with a second-half spark, passing for 132 yards and a touchdown and rushing for 22 yards. The four-star prospect out of Dallas is a dual-threat quarterback, and Auburn struggled to stop the runs of Arkansas’s Taylen Green.
It’s not clear either Thorne or Brown is going to be good enough to help the Tigers have a strong SEC record. Thorne has more experience and is a better runner, but it will likely come down to who is deemed less likely to lose the game with mistakes.
Oklahoma is adept at forcing turnovers and Auburn is prone to committing them. The Sooners are tied for the national lead with 12 takeaways, including an FBS-best eight forced fumbles. Auburn has thrown eight interceptions and lost six fumbles, ranking next-to-last nationally in turnover margin.
“It’s sickening, truthfully, to know that you’re averaging almost 7 yards a rush and creating explosive plays and not scoring the points that should come with what those stats say,” Freeze said. “But I’ve never been (on) any team that turned the football over and won football games.”
Both teams lean heavily on transfer receivers in their passing game. Oklahoma’s Deion Burks, a Purdue transfer, has 26 catches, the most by any player in their first four games with the Sooners. He has gained 201 yards with three touchdowns.
Penn State transfer KeAndre Lambert-Smith is leading Auburn with 12 catches for 338 yards and an SEC-leading five touchdowns.
Both previous Oklahoma-Auburn matchups have come in the Sugar Bowl. The third-ranked Sooners won 40-22 to end the 1971 season against the fifth-ranked Tigers. No. 7 Oklahoma ended Bob Stoops’ tenure with a 35-19 win over No. 17 Auburn to finish off the 2016 season.
The Sooners’ only other game in the state of Alabama ended with Stoops’ top-ranked team beating the Alabama Crimson Tide 20-13 in 2003.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill Thursday bringing back tough criminal penalties targeting large-scale stealing schemes and smash-and-grab robberies that have fueled voter frustration across the state. 
The new law requires prosecutors to start imposing harsher sentences again for those who damage or destroy property valued at more than $50,000 while committing a felony. A similar law expired in 2018. The new law will sunset by 2030. 
“California already has some of the strictest retail and property crime laws in the nation — and we have made them even stronger with our recent legislation,” Newsom said in a statement. “We can be tough on crime while also being smart on crime — we don’t need to go back to broken policies of the last century.”
The decision to bring back tough penalties comes as Democratic leaders continue to work to prove that they are tough enough on crime while trying to convince voters to reject a ballot measure that would bring even harsher sentences for repeat offenders of shoplifting and drug charges.
While shoplifting has been a growing problem, large-scale, smash-and-grab thefts, in which groups of individuals brazenly rush into stores and take goods in plain sight, have become a crisis in California and elsewhere in recent years. Such crimes, often captured on video and posted on social media, have brought particular attention to the problem of retail theft in the state.
The new law is part of a bipartisan legislative package of about a dozen bills aiming to crack down on thefts, making it easier to go after repeat shoplifters and auto thieves and increase penalties for those running professional reselling schemes.


“Violent ‘sledgehammer crimes’ and flash-mob attacks by organized gangs must stop now,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, who authored the bill, said in a statement. “Our business owners and workers should not have to live in fear that these crimes will come to their doorstep.”
The measure is also supported by the California Retailers Association, which said the new penalties would serve as “a deterrent against ‘smash and grabs’ and retail crime.” 
But opponents, including criminal justice advocates and public defenders, said the new law will result in more people behind bars for non-retail theft crimes. The measure increases prison time for a wide range of felony charges, they said. That means a person could receive a tougher sentence for offenses such as damaging vehicles while driving under the influence under the new law. 
They also criticized the new law for modeling after a plan proposed in a tougher-on-crime ballot initiative, which Newsom and Democratic lawmakers spent months lambasting and unsuccessfully fighting to keep off the November ballot. The new law will expire in five years, while the ballot measure proposes a plan to make the harsher penalties permanent. 
“If we’re opposed to it being permanent, why aren’t we opposed to it being temporary?” said Taina Vargas, executive director of Initiate Justice Action, about the new law. “This makes it apparent that, you know, certain individuals in the Legislature and the governor just want to give off the impression of doing something.”
How to tackle crimes in California has become increasingly difficult to navigate in recent years for state Democrats, many of whom have spent the last decade championing progressive policies to depopulate jails and prisons and invest in rehabilitation programs. 
As the issue could even affect the makeup — and control — of Congress, some Democrats broke with party leadership and said they supported Proposition 36, the tough-on-crime approach.
Newsom’s administration has spent $267 million to help dozens of local law enforcement agencies increase patrols, buy surveillance equipment and prosecute more criminals. Law enforcement across the state has arrested 6,900 people for retail theft crimes in the first six months of the operation, Newsom’s office said Thursday. 
It is hard to quantify the retail crime issue in California because of the lack of local data, but many point to major store closures and everyday products like toothpaste being locked behind plexiglass as evidence of a crisis. The California Retailers Association said it is challenging to quantify the issue in California because many stores don’t share their data.",False

A TV weather reporter in Atlanta interrupted his live shot about Hurricane Helene Friday to rescue a woman from a vehicle stranded by rising floodwaters. 
In video of the rescue, standing in the rain with the submerged vehicle behind him, FOX Weather meteorologist Bob Van Dillen describes how the woman drove into a flooded area. 
He says he has called 911, and she can be heard screaming as he tries to assure her that help is on the way. Then he says to the camera: “It’s a situation. We’ll get back to you in a little bit. I’m going to see if I can help this lady out a little bit more you guys.” 
Van Dillen is then seen wading through the water with the woman on her back, carrying her to safety.
Later, in an interview, he said he dropped everything to help. 
“I took my wallet out of my pants, and I went in there, waded in, got chest deep,” Van Dillen said. “She was in there, she was still strapped into her car and the water was actually rising and getting up into the car itself, so she was about, almost neck deep submerged in her own car.” 
Subramaniam Vincent, director of journalism and media ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, said this was an example of a reporter’s role intersecting with human responsibility. 
It’s clear that while he had a professional obligation to report the news, “there’s also someone whose potential life is at risk,” Vincent said. “So I think the call he made is a human call.” 
Considering the rising waters and the woman’s cries for help, along with not knowing when help would arrive, “it’s a straightforward case of jumping in — a fellow citizen actually helping another,” Vincent said.",False

ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Algeria’s constitutional court on Saturday certified the landslide victory of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in last weekend’s election after retabulating vote counts that he and his two opponents had called into question.
The court said that it had reviewed local voting data to settle questions about irregularities that Tebboune’s opponents had alleged in two appeals on Monday.
“After verification of the minutes of the regions and correction of the errors noted in the counting of the votes,” it had lowered Tebboune’s vote share and determined that his two opponents had won hundreds of thousands more votes than previously reported, said Omar Belhadj, the constitutional court’s president.
The court’s decision makes Tebboune the official winner of the Sept. 7 election. His government will next decide when to inaugurate him for a second term.
The court’s retabulated figures showed Tebboune leading Islamist challenger Abdellali Hassan Cherif by around 75 percentage points. With 7.7 million votes, the first-term president won 84.3% of the vote, surpassing 2019 win by millions of votes and a double-digit margin.
Cherif, running with the Movement of Society for Peace, won nearly 950,000 votes, or roughly 9.6%. The Socialist Forces Front’s Youcef Aouchiche won more than 580,000 votes, or roughly 6.1%.
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024
Notably, both challengers surpassed the threshold required to receive reimbursement for campaign expenses. Under its election laws, Algeria pays for political campaigns that receive more than a 5% vote share. The results announced by the election authority last week showed Cherif and Aouchiche with 3.2% and 2.2% of the vote, respectively. Both were criticized for participating in an election that government critics denounced as a way for Algeria’s political elite to make a show of democracy amid broader political repression.
Throughout the campaign, each of the three campaigns emphasized participation, calling on voters and youth to participate and defy calls to boycott the ballot.

Publication date:2024-09-27 04:00:00

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Lady Gaga knew the recipe to keep her Las Vegas shows electric: start in the studio. Before each residency performance this summer, she and a group of talented musicians clocked hours-long recording sessions, capturing that spark.
The energy from their studio time flowed into Gaga’s performance and fueled the creation of her new album “Harlequin,” out Friday. The superstar was initially uncertain about the project’s direction before embracing the challenge of pushing musical boundaries — much like her fearlessly edgy character in “Joker: Folie à Deux,” which opens in theaters Oct. 4.
“Harlequin” is a companion album for the film, in which Gaga stars as Lee, also better known as the unhinged villain Harley Quinn. Her character served as the driving force behind the album, which seamlessly blends jazz, funk, blues and early American music while drawing from vintage and modern pop.
“I had a really deep relationship with the character, and I just had a lot more that I wanted to say,” said the Grammy and Oscar winner, who recorded “Harlequin” between Malibu, California, and Las Vegas while was finishing her Jazz & Piano residency this summer. She came up with the album idea with her fiancé Michael Polansky, who joined her as the album’s other executive producer.
Polansky said they felt confident booking studio time after talking over music, and noticing parallels between Gaga’s split-identity movie character and her real life alter ego. He said their mission was to let the creative energy flow with jazz as the foundation of the music.


“It was important to us that the album felt cohesive, not because it fit into one style, but because the energy and personality tied it all together,” said Polansky, who called Gaga “brilliant and fearless.” “We still wanted to respect the role of genre to help listeners connect with the music, but we didn’t want it to hold the team back creatively.” 
Before her two-hour-plus Las Vegas set, Gaga and the show’s drummers, trumpeters, bassists, and orchestra members hit the studio and recorded for about six hours. It became a ritual that infused the energy of her live shows into the studio.
“I was focused on pushing this sound every day and pushing ourselves to be as daring as possible,” said Gaga, who produced on all the tracks alongside Benjamin Rice, who won a Grammy for his work on “ A Star is Born ” soundtrack with her and Bradley Cooper. The album features reimagined songs like the 1930s “Get Happy” and the Black spiritual “Oh, When the Saints” along with original tracks such as “Happy Mistake” and “Folie À Deux.”
“This album was made with grace and a lot of focus and real love and dedication for Harley Quinn,” she said. “It’s also a deep love and respect for all the musicians and people that were in the studio with us every single day.”
“Harlequin” marks Gaga’s first jazz-inspired album since the death of her longtime collaborator and close friend Tony Bennett. She frequently reflects on his wise words.
“He always used to say to me, ‘If you stick with quality, you’ll never go wrong,’” recalled Gaga, who had shared the stage with Bennett and collaborated on two albums: 2014’s “Cheek to Cheek” and 2021’s “Love For Sale,” which both won Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album. She said Bennett, who died at 96 in 2023, would have celebrated someone like herself who was excited to explore new horizons of “what jazz can mean today and what music can be.”
“I wanted to make a really high quality album that has sophisticated musicianship,” she said. “Tony is the anchor in a lot of ways. No matter how much you may drift from the classic old school approach that these songs can take, as long as there were moments where we returned to the study and discipline of jazz, it kind of anchors the whole record.”
Along with her companion album, Gaga said she expects to release a studio album in February. It’ll be her first since 2020’s “Chromatica,” which featured the Grammy-winning song “Rain on Me” with Ariana Grande.
“I’m finished with that record,” she said. “It’s all a part of each other, although the music is vastly different.”
Gaga’s happiness with her life has sparked her musical creativity. She was excited to get into the studio and collaborate with people she “loves and respects.”
“This is probably the most clear I have felt in about a decade for myself just personally,” she said. “I feel more on my game with this music than I have in a really long time. It’s one of the reasons I’m so grateful to my partner, Michael, for his creative collaboration and support in all this.”
Gaga added that “When you’re feeling clear and healthy and happy, I feel like that’s when your art can really fly.”",False

Dalman was hurt Sunday night during the second quarter while blocking for Bijan Robinson on a 2-yard run. Ryan Neuzil took over at center and went the rest of the game, won by the Chiefs 22-17.
The Falcons (1-2) host the New Orleans Saints this Sunday. 
Right tackle Kaleb McGary also left during the second quarter of the Chiefs game, sustaining a knee injury that deprived Atlanta of two starters on the offensive line for the majority of the contest. The Falcons haven’t provided an update on McGary’s status. 
The makeshift line, with Storm Norton taking over for McGary, struggled to protect quarterback Kirk Cousins and failed to provide many holes for the running game. Cousins was sacked twice and hit 10 times, while Robinson was thrown for a 3-yard loss on a fourth-and-1 play in the final minute to seal the Chiefs’ victory.
With Dalman out, the Falcons promoted lineman Elijah Wilkinson to the active roster from the practice squad. Wilkinson played for the Arizona Cardinals last season after starting nine games at left guard for the Falcons in 2022. 
Atlanta also brought back former starting center Matt Hennessy, a third-round pick in 2020 who failed to pan out, signing him to the practice squad.
Hennessey started all 17 games for the Falcons in 2021, only to lose his job the following season. He didn’t play at all in 2023 after going on injured reserve and was released by the Philadelphia Eagles ahead of this season.

ATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Georgia defensive star Mykel Williams sustained a sprained left ankle in the season-opening victory over Clemson, but it isn’t expected to be a long-term issue, coach Kirby Smart said Monday.
Describing the injury as a Grade 2 sprain, Smart said Williams is questionable for the home opener Saturday when the No. 1 Bulldogs take on FBS school Tennessee Tech.
Williams, an edge rusher, had two tackles for losses before he hobbled off the field in the third quarter after an illegal block below the waist.
“It’s stable,” Smart said. “He’ll be week-to-week. Probably questionable this week, but not going to be a long-term ankle.”
The Bulldogs also lost defensive tackle Warren Brinson to a bruised ankle in the first quarter. Smart said the injury is not considered serious and the Bulldogs are hopeful he’ll be able to play against Tennessee Tech.
Nickel back Joenel Aguero also could be available after missing the Clemson game with a pulled muscle. He was able to take part in a walk-through Monday morning. 
Receiver Dillon Bell should be ready to go after dealing with cramping issues against Clemson.

CAIRO (AP) — New fighting rocked Sudan’s capital on Thursday with airstrikes and drone attacks in and around Khartoum amid a worsening cholera outbreak, officials said.
Sudan’s military launched an operation in the early hours of Thursday aimed at taking control of areas in the capital that had been in the hands of its enemy, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. Sudanese media reported increased military movements and airstrikes in the districts of Khartoum and Omdurman, the heaviest in the capital area in months. 
Mohamed Ibrahim, the health ministry’s spokesperson in Khartoum, said in a statement that four civilians were killed and 14 others wounded in the latest fighting in the Karrari district of Omdurman, a city next to the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
A military spokesman confirmed the operation was underway, but declined to comment further. A military spokesman confirmed the operation was underway, but declined to comment further. The head of Sudan’s military, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, addressed the U.N. General Assembly in New York, saying that “we’ve done everything we could to put an end to this war and to steer our country from the destruction being waged” by the militia.
He maintained that position when he spoke to reporters at the Sudanese Mission to the United Nations on Thursday evening.
“The operation going on in Khartoum is meant to preserve the integrity of our country, the safety of our people and our armed forces,” he said.


“The military solution is the last one,” Burhan continued. “We crave a peaceful solution that spares out people more suffering, more hunger, more displacement.” 
Burhan, who led a military takeover of Sudan in 2021, is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.
His country plunged into chaos in April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military led by Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo broke out into street battles in Khartoum. Fighting has spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas and the western Darfur region.
At a General Assembly whose doomsday feeling was fueled by three major wars along with inaction on global warming, the fighting and humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan took third place after the killing in the Middle East and Ukraine. The lack of focus on Sudan was bemoaned by many. 
The “brutal power struggle” between Sudan’s warring generals has “unleashed horrific violence,” including widespread rape, and a “humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding as famine spreads,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told the annual high-level gathering of the 193 member nations on Tuesday.
Saudi Arabia, the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations met without measurable results Wednesday to urge Sudan’s warring parties in Sudan to hold breaks in the fighting and allow aid to reach civilians.
“More than 25 million Sudanese face acute hunger,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement Wednesday. “Some 11 million have fled their homes in what has become the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet ... We must compel the warring parties to accept humanitarian pauses.” 
Jeremy Laurence, a spokesman for the U.N. human rights office in Geneva, said in a statement to The Associated Press on Thursday that at least 78 civilians were killed because of artillery shelling and airstrikes since the beginning of September in the Khartoum area.
“Our immediate concern is for the welfare of civilians, and the likelihood of further displacement and damage to civilian infrastructure,” he said.
For months, some of the worst fighting has been in the city of El Fasher, the capital of the North Darfur state. RSF forces have laid siege to the city since May. On Thursday, U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said that artillery shelling on a market there had killed at least 20 civilians on Sep. 20 and 21. 
Meanwhile, the death toll from Sudan’s cholera outbreak jumped by nearly 100 or nearly 20% in only two days, Sudan’s health ministry said Wednesday, in a worrying sign that the disease is spreading more rapidly. A total of 473 people have died from cholera since the country’s rainy season began two months ago, health officials said.
Sudan’s Federal Ministry of Health in a Wednesday update reported on Facebook 14,944 cholera cases across 10 states, with 386 new cases. It said that six people died on Tuesday alone in six states. 
The majority of cases were reported in Kassala, where UNICEF is collaborating with the ministry and the World Health Organization to carry out a second round of the oral cholera vaccination campaign that kicked off last week.
UNICEF delivered 404,000 doses of the vaccine to Sudan on Sep. 9. More vaccination campaigns are expected to be rolled out in other affected states. 
Cholera was officially declared an outbreak on August 12 by the health ministry after a new wave of cases was reported starting July 22. The disease is spreading in areas devastated by recent heavy rainfalls and floods, especially in eastern Sudan which sheltered millions of people displaced by the conflict between the Sudanese military and the RSF. 
Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and could be fatal if not immediately treated, according to WHO. It’s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.
UNICEF said in a statement last week that an estimated 3.4 million children under the age of 5 are at high risk of epidemic diseases. 
The war in Sudan created environments prone to disease outbreaks, impacting millions of people already experiencing food insecurity and displacement. The country plunged into war in April 2023 after tensions increased between the military and the RSF.

Publication date:2024-09-25 22:36:00

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The president of the Dominican Republic warned Wednesday that his administration would take “drastic measures” to protect the country if a U.N.-backed mission in neighboring Haiti targeting gang violence fails.
Luis Abinader did not provide details of what action he might take during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Gangs in Haiti control 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and they have grown more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. More than 3,600 people have been reported killed during the first half of this year, a more than 70% increase compared with the same period last year. The violence also has left nearly 700,000 Haitians homeless in recent years and thousands have fled Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.
Abinader thanked Kenya, which is leading the mission in Haiti with nearly 400 police officers from the East African country recently joined by nearly two dozen police and soldiers from Jamaica and two senior military officers from Belize. Another 300 police from Kenya are expected to deploy within a month.
The personnel, however, falls significantly short of the 2,500 pledged by various countries for the mission, which the U.S. government warns is lacking resources as it considers a possible U.N. peacekeeping mission.
Abinader said the current mission needs to be fully established so that free and transparent elections can be held. Haiti has not held elections since 2016, and a transitional presidential council was ordered to do so by February 2026.


“Practically one year from the holding of elections, the conditions are still not in place to do so,” Abinader said as he expressed concern over the future of the mission. “We cannot allow the effort made to date to fail. If that were to happen, Haiti’s collapse would be imminent.”
Earlier this year, gangs launched coordinated attacks targeting critical government infrastructure. They raided more than two dozen police stations, opened fire on the main international airport, forcing it to close for nearly three months, and stormed Haiti’s two biggest prisons, releasing roughly 4,000 inmates.
The attacks led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Ariel Henry and the creation of a transitional presidential council.
“More than three years of instability in our neighboring country has put significant pressure on our own security,” Abinader said. “The Dominican state has shouldered a high responsibility in the Haitian crisis, far more than should be expected of it.”
Abinader said that last year, 10% of medical appointments involved Haitians and that 147,000 of 200,000 foreign minors in the Dominican education system are Haitian in origin.
“The crisis in Haiti warrants particular attention,” he said. “We can’t do it alone.”
Under Abinader, Dominican officials last year deported more than 170,000 people believed to be Haitians, according to government data. But the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration has estimated the number is closer to more than 224,000.
Activists have long criticized Abinader and his administration for what they say is the ongoing violation of the human rights of Haitians and those born in the Dominican Republic to parents of Haitian descent.
Abinader has rejected the accusations, reiterating Wednesday that “the Dominican government is profoundly committed to protecting human rights.”
In his speech, he noted that the Dominican Republic’s 19% poverty rate is the lowest in the country’s history, and the murder rate has dropped to 10 killings for every 100,000 inhabitants, compared with 13 in 2022.
The president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council, Edgard Leblanc Fils, is scheduled to speak Thursday at the U.N. General Assembly.
He and other government officials did not respond to messages for comment following Abinader’s speech.
Also on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who recently traveled to Haiti, met with other officials at the U.N. to discuss the mission. They talked about the status of contributions, the timeline of other deployments and the possibility of a U.N. peacekeeping mission as one option to secure funds and personnel.
A senior U.S. State Department official said the most urgent priority is to renew the mission’s mandate, which expires Oct. 2.
The official said the U.S. and some of its partners would like to make changes to the mandate to lay out a path “to become a more traditional peacekeeping operation,” but the Russians and Chinese, who supported the initial mandate, have expressed concerns about doing that. 
The main benefit of modifying the mandate would be securing a more stable funding stream for the mission: “We’re optimistic that the renewal will happen in some form,” the official said.
Prime Minister Garry Conille said during the meeting that while Haiti’s situation has improved a bit, “we’re nowhere near winning this.”
He said about 25% of Haiti’s police officers have left the country, and of those still working, about two are wounded and one killed every week.
“The police force right now is underequipped to be able to handle this and will need further support and help and accompaniment if we’re to be successful,” Conille said.
He said he expects Haiti to hold elections by November “even though we know we will not have the highest level of security.”
During the meeting, Blinken announced an additional $160 million to help Haitians and U.S. Treasury Department sanctions against former Haitian lawmaker Prophane Victor, accused of supporting and arming gangs. Also sanctioned was gang leader Luckson Elan, accused of human rights abuses.
Neither could be reached for comment.
In a message delivered to officials who met to talk about the mission, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the first deployments were a positive step but warned gangs are still committing “egregious human rights abuses” and that funding for the mission “remains totally inadequate.”
“Improving security is crucial to creating the conditions necessary for these elections,” he said as he described the situation in Haiti as “one of the most disastrous humanitarian situations in the world.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia has launched a counteroffensive in its Kursk region to dislodge Ukraine’s forces who stormed across the border five weeks ago and put Russian territory under foreign occupation for the first time since World War II, Ukraine’s president said Thursday. 
Russia’s Defense Ministry said that Moscow’s forces had recaptured 10 settlements in Kursk and listed their names but didn’t describe the fighting as a counteroffensive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was taking “counteroffensive actions” but that Ukrainian forces had anticipated the moves and were ready to fight.
Ukraine launched its daring incursion into Kursk on Aug. 6, partly in the hope that Russia would divert its troops there from Donetsk in eastern Ukraine where a push by the Russian army is threatening to overrun a belt of key defensive strongholds.
The cross-border operation also raised Ukrainian morale after months of gloomy news from the front by exposing Russian vulnerabilities and seizing some initiative on the battlefield. It also sought to establish a buffer zone to prevent Russian attacks.
Moscow’s muddled response suggested Russia hadn’t planned for such a development and was caught by surprise. Assembling forces for a counterattack, given the long distances involved and other demands along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, was expected to take some time.


The Russian army has been hacking its way deeper into eastern Ukraine, especially Donetsk, and has battered Ukrainian territory with relentless missile and drone attacks.
A Russian missile attack Thursday killed three people and injured two others, all of them Ukrainian workers with the International Committee of the Red Cross, Ukraine’s Human Rights Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets said.
The toll was the largest among staffers at the Geneva-based humanitarian organization since a bomb blast killed three at the Aden airport in Yemen in 2020.
The key eastern Ukraine city of Pokrovsk is without a drinking water supply or natural gas for cooking and heating, authorities said, as the Russian army’s attritional slog across the Donetsk region lays waste to public infrastructure and forces civilians to flee their homes.
A water filtration station in Pokrovsk was damaged in recent fighting, and more than 300 hastily drilled water wells are the city’s last source of drinking water, Donetsk regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said.
The previous day, Russians destroyed a natural gas distribution station near Pokrovsk, Filashkin said. Some 18,000 people remain in the city, including 522 children, he said. More than 20,000 people have left in the past six weeks as Russian forces creep closer to residential areas, Filashkin said.
“Evacuation is the only … choice for civilians,” he added.
Pokrovsk is one of Ukraine’s main defensive strongholds and a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region. Its capture would compromise Ukraine’s defensive abilities and supply routes and would bring Russia closer to its stated goal of capturing the entire Donetsk region, which it partially occupies.
Russian troops backed by artillery and powerful glide bombs have turned Donetsk cities and towns such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka into bombed-out shells, though the push has cost Russia heavily in troops and armor.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday ended a Ukraine-focused European tour after hearing repeated appeals from Ukrainian officials to use Western-supplied weaponry for long-range strikes inside Russia.
President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to fire U.S.-provided missiles across the border into Russia in self-defense, but has largely limited the distance they can be fired. Extending the limit could bring Russian retaliation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin in turn warned that allowing long-range strikes “would mean that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries are at war with Russia ... if this is so, then, bearing in mind the change in the very essence of this conflict, we will make appropriate decisions based on the threats that will be created for us.”
Ukrainian forces have held out as long as possible in Donetsk, even when strongholds such as Chasiv Yar appeared to be in danger of imminent collapse. 
Russia has fired missiles especially at the power grid, potentially dooming Ukrainians to a bitterly cold winter this year.
The United States and Britain pledged nearly $1.5 billion in additional aid to Ukraine on Wednesday during a visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats. Much of that will go to restoring the electricity supply.
“We’re again seeing Putin dust off his winter playbook, targeting Ukrainian energy and electricity systems to weaponize the cold against the Ukrainian people,” Blinken said. An overnight drone attack on Konotop, a town in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region, largely knocked out the electricity supply, regional officials said.
The blasts also blew out an “incredibly high number” of windows in the city and damaged many of the town’s tram tracks, Mayor Artem Semenikhin said.
Russia launched a total of 64 Shahed drones and five missiles over eastern, central, and northern regions of Ukraine, Ukraine’s air force said in its Thursday morning report.
Ukraine has expressed frustration that its Western partners won’t let it use sophisticated modern weapons they supply to hit places inside Russia where the missiles and drones are launched from. Some Western leaders fear that would trigger an escalation of the war.
But after Iran recently supplied ballistic missiles to Russia, according to the U.S., those rules of engagement could be set to change in coming days as heavier Russian bombardments could swamp Ukraine’s meager air defenses.
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz said Thursday that U.S. long-range guided missiles, such as ATACMS, wouldn’t be able to reach all the locations from where Russia launches some of its assets. He added that “the supply of ATACMS is finite, and we need to be judicious about where and when they are deployed.”
In other developments, Ukrainian Military Intelligence claimed to have shot down a Russian Su-30SM jet over the Black Sea.
A post on the agency’s social media Thursday said the warplane was hit with a portable surface-to-air missile.
Also, Zelenkskyy posted photos of a ship loaded with grain that he said was struck by a Russian missile Thursday shortly after leaving Ukrainian territorial waters.
The merchant ship was taking wheat to Egypt, Zelenskyy wrote on his Telegram page, adding that nobody was injured in the strike. 
Ukraine last year managed to break through Russia’s Black Sea blockade and ship millions of tons of grain using a route that hugs Ukraine’s southern coast.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Bo Nix finally threw his first NFL touchdown pass in his fourth pro start — and it came at a great time for the Denver Broncos.
Nix and the offense overcame a miserable first half and the Broncos held on to beat a banged-up Aaron Rodgers and the sloppy New York Jets 10-9 in a defensive standoff on a rainy Sunday.
“Usually these weather games turn into run-the-football games, and that’s what we did in the second half,” Nix said. “It worked in our favor and we didn’t turn the ball over.”
Nix was 7 of 15 for minus-7 yards in the first two quarters, and finished with just 60 yards on 12-of-25 passing — but the Broncos (2-2) ran for 126 yards and controlled the momentum in the second half.
And Nix made the big play when he needed with both offenses struggling mightily.
With the Broncos trailing 6-0, Nix found a wide-open Courtland Sutton in the back of the end zone to give Denver the lead with 3:08 left in the third quarter.
Nix, the No. 12 overall pick in April, tossed a high pass to the back of the end zone where Sutton went up, grabbed the ball and got both feet down for the 8-yard score. It capped what was easily the Broncos’ best drive to that point, with Nix leading Denver 87 yards on 11 plays.
Rodgers came up limping a bit after a sack late in the fourth quarter and seemed to be favoring his left leg — the same on which his Achilles tendon was surgically repaired last year — and was looked at on the sideline by trainers.


“Yeah, I’m banged up a little bit, but, yeah, I’m OK,” Rodgers said after the game, adding both legs are dealing with “stuff.” 
It appeared Rodgers might have also fumbled on the play, but the Broncos were out of challenges so Sean Payton couldn’t ask officials to review.

Rodgers came back on the Jets’ next possession with 2:31 remaining but couldn’t get anything going. Facing fourth-and-10 on New York’s 45, Rodgers was sacked from behind by a blitzing P.J. Locke to give the Broncos the ball at the 35.
The defense came up big and New York (2-2) used all three of its timeouts, and the Broncos’ drive ended with Wil Lutz pushing a 50-yarder wide left.
That gave Rodgers and the Jets one more chance.
New York got down to the Broncos 32 and Greg Zuerlein, who made three earlier kicks, lined up for a potential winning field goal — but his 50-yarder curved to the right. Nix and the Broncos were able to kneel down for their second straight road victory after also topping Tampa Bay last week.
“It was a gritty win,” Payton said. “I’m proud of how we fought. ... I don’t know that either team expected the weather to impact the game like it did that much in the first half.”
The Broncos stayed on the East Coast and spent the week preparing for the Jets at The Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia.
“It was huge to go on the road and get two tough wins against two tough defenses and two tough offenses,” Nix said. ”You can’t say enough about our defense on this winning stretch.”
Rodgers was 24 of 42 for 225 yards and was sacked five times. New York also was penalized 13 times.
“I think we were kind of killing ourselves,” Rodgers said. “I can’t say I had a spectacular game. I missed some throws.
“The weather sucked, but so did some of my throws.”
The Jets bounced right back from Sutton’s touchdown to regain the lead on Zuerlein’s 40-yarder. But the Broncos marched down the field — on seven straight runs — to set up Lutz’s 47-yarder to put Denver back on top 10-9 with 8:55 left.
The Jets had just 15 total yards and the Broncos 6 in the first quarter. New York broke through 9 seconds into the second quarter on Zuerlein’s 23-yard field goal. 
Broncos running back Tyler Badie was placed on a back board and carted from the sideline with a back injury. He caught a pass from Nix on a third-down play shortly before the end of the opening quarter and was immediately hit by Quincy Williams for a 4-yard loss and fumbled the ball. Michael Carter II recovered for the Jets.
Badie was seen on his back on the sideline a few minutes later, with trainers working on him before he was taken from the field.
Payton said he had “no update” on Badie’s condition after the game, and wouldn’t say whether the running back would travel home with the team.
New York’s Allen Lazard was called for a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty when he caught a 13-yard pass from Rodgers for a first down in the third quarter. He celebrated by signaling for a first down with what officials deemed was a gun-like gesture with both hands. 
The NFL has warned players to not make “violent gestures.” Atlanta wide receiver Drake London was fined $14,069 for unsportsmanlike conduct/violent gesture for a gun-like celebration in a recent game. Giants rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers was also recently fined $28,128 for two “gun-like” celebrations.
Broncos: Host the AFC West-rival Las Vegas Raiders next Sunday.
Jets: Head to London to play Minnesota next Sunday morning at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The mayor of Waukesha on Wednesday condemned a campaign ad run by a Republican independent group that links Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin with the killings of six people at a 2021 Christmas parade in that Wisconsin city.
Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly called the ad a “pitiful political tool” that “doesn’t just hurt the families that had members that were killed, or those that were injured or those that even saw it, it hurts the whole entire community.”
Baldwin faces Republican Eric Hovde in one of the most hotly contested Senate races in the country this year. The race is crucial for Democrats to win to maintain majority control of the Senate.
The ad, which began airing across Wisconsin last week, was paid for by One Nation, an independent group aligned with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
“This issue ad focused on Senator Baldwin’s vote against increased funding for pretrial detention of violent criminals and included a call-to-action at the end,” said One Nation spokesperson Torunn Sinclair. “It’s not political.”
She said the ad stopped running on Monday. It remained viewable online on Wednesday.
Reilly said in a telephone interview that “our pain and our suffering from the 2021 Waukesha Christmas parade is once again being used by unprincipled people to drive votes.”
Reilly referred to a joint statement issued by Baldwin and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson shortly after the parade killings in 2021 urging no one to use it for political gain.


“I would hope that Eric Hovde would also support what Sen. Johnson said,” Reilly said. “No politician should allow the use of the Waukesha Christmas parade attack and its impact on our community to drive votes by creating fear and disgust to purposely create divisions.”
Hovde said after touring a manufacturing business in Waunakee, Wisconsin, that he wasn’t familiar with the ad in question. But he accused Baldwin and her allies of unfairly attacking him, including the allegation that he is more of a Californian because he bought a business and a home there than he is a Wisconsinite where he was born.
“I think we need to lower the rhetoric on both sides,” Hovde said. “I would prefer not to see all these negative attack ads. I’d rather focus on the issues.”
Baldwin’s campaign spoke out against the parade ad.
“Using the attack for political purposes is not only wrong, it is deeply hurtful to a community still recovering from the tragedy of that day,” her campaign spokesman Andrew Mamo said.
Reilly used to be a Republican but disavowed the party after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He said he is now an independent who supports Baldwin in the Senate race.
The ad shows footage from the Waukesha Christmas parade in November 2021 after Darrell Brooks Jr. drove his SUV through the parade route, killing six people. Brooks was sentenced to six life consecutive sentences without parole.
“It never should have happened,” the narrator of the ad says over the sound of sirens and video images of people running along the parade route and people hovering over those struck by the SUV. The narrator adds that Brooks was released on $1,000 bail just days earlier after trying to run over his girlfriend with the same car.
The ad then shows an image of Baldwin on the Senate floor, with the narrator saying she voted against funding for pretrial detention of violent criminals. The ad cites an Aug. 7, 2022, vote, which came nearly a year after the parade killings.
What to know about the 2024 Election
The narrator says the vote made it “easier for criminals like Darrell Brooks to terrorize our communities.” The ad ends with side-by-side images of Baldwin on the Senate floor and Brooks in an orange prison outfit.
Baldwin had nothing to do with the setting of Brooks’ bail before the Christmas parade.
The $1,000 bail was the amount requested by the Milwaukee County district attorney’s office. District Attorney John Chisholm acknowledged later that the $1,000 bail request from an assistant prosecutor in his office was far too low.
The judge granted the bail request, which Brooks posted, just days before he drove through the Christmas parade, killing six.
Wisconsin voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2023, pushed by Republicans after the parade killings, that makes it easier for judges to post higher bail amounts.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — The New York Mets weren’t supposed to get this far. Neither were the Milwaukee Brewers.
Yet here they are squaring off in a best-of-three NL Wild Card Series beginning Tuesday in Milwaukee. 
These two teams should know each other well. The Mets finished playing a series in Milwaukee on Sunday before heading to Atlanta to play a makeup doubleheader Monday that determined the NL’s final two playoff participants. A doubleheader split put the Braves and Mets in the playoffs while eliminating the Arizona Diamondbacks.
Now the Mets head back to Milwaukee for an unlikely postseason matchup.
“We’ve answered the bell,” New York first baseman Pete Alonso said during the team’s playoff-clinching celebration Monday. “We’ve earned the right to play in the postseason. Now this is when we have a great opportunity in front of us.”
The Mets went 75-87 in 2023 and were 22-33 near the end of May, but they came on strong the rest of the way under new manager Carlos Mendoza to earn the NL’s final wild-card spot.
“There were a lot of times this year when it would have been easy for these guys to start pointing fingers, and that never happened,” Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said. “They hung together, believed in each other, and it allows us to get to a moment like this, which is pretty cool.”
Milwaukee was an even bigger surprise in winning its second straight NL Central title.


The Brewers lost manager Craig Counsell to the rival Chicago Cubs in the offseason. Two-time All-Star pitcher Brandon Woodruff missed the season following shoulder surgery and 2021 Cy Young Award winner Corbin Burnes was traded in January to Baltimore. Milwaukee lost pitchers Wade Miley and Robert Gasser to Tommy John surgeries. And then Christian Yelich hurt his back and didn’t play after July 23.
The Brewers never flinched. They took over the NL Central lead near the end of April and stayed there the rest of the way.
“They did it by pulling together and playing a certain way, and they know that’s the secret,” said Brewers manager Pat Murphy, a former bench coach on Counsell’s staff. “I don’t think they wipe the slate clean in that, ‘This is how I play.’ The numbers are out the window. It doesn’t matter. Now it’s about win today, and they’ve kind of been doing that all year.”
The small-market Brewers are making their sixth postseason appearance in seven years, but they haven’t won a playoff series since reaching Game 7 of the 2018 NL Championship Series. Milwaukee has lost nine of its last 10 playoff games.
While previous Brewers teams were anchored by a dominant rotation featuring Burnes, Woodruff and Freddy Peralta, this year’s squad went 93-69 behind Gold Glove-caliber defense, chaos-inducing speed on the bases and steady and effective pitching.
“We feel different,” Peralta said. “I can tell. Even today, the vibes that we have right now, you can see on everybody’s face that we are all knowing where we are, knowing where we’re going, and where we want to be.”
Stearns joined the Brewers as general manager in October 2015 and was promoted to president of baseball operations before the 2019 season. He stepped down after the 2022 season and took the same position with the Mets a year later.
Now his new team faces his former one with high stakes.
Peralta (11-9, 3.68 ERA) will start Game 1, but Murphy isn’t saying how the Brewers will set up their pitching beyond that. Peralta is 0-1 with a 3.46 ERA in four postseason appearances.
The Mets figure to start Luis Severino (11-7, 3.91) and Sean Manaea (12-6, 3.47) in the first two games, and then Jose Quintana (10-10, 3.75) would be on full rest for a potential Game 3.
While the Mets were able to save Severino for the playoff opener by winning Game 1 of the doubleheader in Atlanta, it’s uncertain what closer Edwin Díaz might have left in the tank Tuesday after throwing 66 pitches over the past two days.
Milwaukee outfielder Sal Frelick bruised his left hip while chasing a foul ball Friday, creating doubt for his availability this week.
“He’s still limping, so I’m not as optimistic as I was hoping to be,” Murphy said.
Frelick told reporters that he will be ”ready to go.”
“I don’t think I’d put myself out there if I thought that it was going to hurt the team, if I thought I couldn’t make a play, couldn’t steal a base, stuff like that,” Frelick said. “I’m comfortable saying that I can, I can go out and play like I have the whole year.”
Frelick crashed into the right-field sidewall, and his left side made contact with the metal chain link inside a window in that wall with no protective padding. Along with the traditional bunting adorning the concourses and logos painted onto American Family Field for the postseason, the Brewers installed new padding to the section of wall that Frelick hit.
The Brewers have won 12 of their last 14 meetings with the Mets. They were 5-0 against the Mets this year before losing 5-0 on Sunday.
Much of Milwaukee’s success against the Mets has come from its running game. The Brewers stole 17 bases in six games against New York without getting caught a single time, though they did have a runner picked off once.
Milwaukee’s Brice Turang went 9 of 19 and stole seven bases without getting caught in the Brewers’ six regular-season games with the Mets. Jackson Chourio was 9 for 25 at the plate against the Mets. Longtime Mets nemesis Rhys Hoskins batted just .222 but had two homers and eight RBIs in 18 at-bats.
New York’s Francisco Alvarez went 7 for 15 with a homer, four RBIs and a 1.260 OPS against the Brewers this season. Starling Marte had a .389 on-base percentage and .600 slugging percentage. Jose Iglesias was 5 for 11.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican authorities said Friday they have detected and seized 24 drug cartel surveillance cameras fixed to telephone and light posts in the border city of San Luis Rio Colorado. 
The city on the border with Arizona has suffered years of violence between drug cartels fighting for control of the border crossing, where they can smuggle drugs. 
Prosecutors in northern Sonora state said the cameras had been placed there by “falcons,” the name commonly used in Mexico for drug cartel lookouts seeking to keep tabs on the movements of soldiers and police.
Army troops removed the devices, and photos suggested they were common porch-style cameras wrapped in duct tape. They were found in three different neighborhoods, and some were even found attached to palm trees.
San Luis Rio Colorado, located across from Yuma, Arizona, is best known as a border town where Americans go for inexpensive prescriptions and dental work. But it has increasingly been hit by drug cartel violence.
It is not the first border city where cartels have installed their own surveillance networks. 
In 2015, a drug cartel in the northern state of Tamaulipas used at least 39 surveillance cameras to monitor the comings and goings of authorities in the city of Reynosa across the border from McAllen, Texas. 
The cameras were powered by electric lines above the city streets and accessed the internet through phone cables along the same poles, and included modems and were capable of operating wirelessly or through commercial providers’ lines.


Several of the cameras were trained on an army base, while others captured movement outside a marine post, offices of the attorney general and state police as well as shopping centers, major thoroughfares and some neighborhoods.
Over the course of 2015, authorities also discovered 55 radio communication antennas between the nearby border cities of Matamoros and Miguel Aleman.",False

WINDER, Ga. (AP) — A 14-year-old student opened fire at a Georgia high school and killed four people on Wednesday, authorities said, sending students scrambling for shelter in their classrooms — and eventually to the football stadium — as officers swarmed the campus and parents raced to find out if their children were safe. 

The dead were identified as two students and two teachers at Apalachee High School in Winder, about an hour’s drive from Atlanta. Killed were two other 14-year-olds, Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, and instructors Richard Aspinwall and Christina Irimie, Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said in a nighttime news conference. 

At least nine other people — eight students and one teacher — were taken to hospitals with injuries. All were expected to survive, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith said.



The words “hard lockdown” appeared on a screen in junior Layla Ferrell’s health class and lights began flashing. She and her frightened classmates piled desks and chairs in front of the door to create a barricade, she recalled.

Sophomore Kaylee Abner was in geometry class when she heard the gunshots. She and her classmates ducked behind their teacher’s desk, and then the teacher began flipping the desk in an attempt to barricade the classroom door, Abner said. A classmate beside her was praying, and she held his hand while they all waited for police.

After students poured into the football stadium, Abner saw teachers who had taken off their shirts to help treat gunshot wounds.



Two school resource officers encountered the shooter within minutes after a report of shots fired went out, Hosey said. The suspect, a student at the school, immediately surrendered and was taken into custody. He is being charged as an adult with murder. Authorities said the weapon was an assault-style rifle.

The teen had been interviewed after the FBI received anonymous tips in May 2023 about online threats to commit an unspecified school shooting, the agency said in a statement.

The FBI narrowed the threats down and referred to the case to the sheriff’s department in Jackson County, which is adjacent to Barrow County.

The sheriff’s office interviewed the then-13-year-old and his father, who said there were hunting guns in the house but the teen did not have unsupervised access to them. The teen also denied making any online threats.

The sheriff’s office alerted local schools for continued monitoring of the teen, but there was no probable cause for arrest to additional action, the FBI said.

Hosey said the state Division of Family and Children’s Services also had previous contact with the teen and will investigate whether that has any connection with the shooting.

Authorities were still looking into how the suspect obtained the gun used in the shooting and got it into the school in Barrow County, a rapidly suburbanizing area on the edge of metro Atlanta’s ever-expanding sprawl. 

At an afternoon news conference, Smith choked up as he began to speak. He said he was born and raised in the community and his kids are in the school system.

“My heart hurts for these kids. My heart hurts for our community,” he said. “But I want to make it very clear that hate will not prevail in this county. I want that to be very clear and known. Love will prevail over what happened today.”

It was the the latest among dozens of school shootings across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut, Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas. The classroom killings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to active shooter drills in classrooms. But they have done little to move the needle on national gun laws.

Before Wednesday, there had been 29 mass killings in the U.S. so far this year, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. At least 127 people have died in those killings, which are defined as incidents in which four or more people die within a 24-hour period, not including the killer — the same definition used by the FBI.

Last year ended with 217 deaths from 42 mass killings, making 2023 one of the deadliest years on record for such shootings in the country.

On Wednesday in Winder, Landon Culver, an 11th grader, said he had stepped out of his algebra class to get a drink of water when he heard shots and then saw someone wearing a black hoodie with a long gun.

“I didn’t really stick around too long to look,” he said.

Instead he ran back inside the classroom and locked the door. The class huddled in the back in the dark and waited for the rampage to end. Culver listened as gunshots rang out in the building.

“You’re just wondering like, which one of those is going to be somebody that you’re best friends with or somebody that you love?” he said.

Later police officers arrived and escorted the students out. As they were leaving the building, Culver saw “multiple people who had been shot.”

“You hear about this kind of stuff, but you like never think it’s going to happen to you until like it’s happening.”

When Erin Clark, 42, received a text from her son Ethan, a senior, saying there was an active shooter, she rushed from her job at the Amazon warehouse to the school. The two texted “I love you,” and Clark prayed for her him as she drove.

With the main road to the school blocked, she parked and ran with other parents. They were directed to the football field, and amid the chaos, Clark found Ethan sitting on the bleachers. 

Clark said her son was writing an essay in class when he first heard gunfire. He worked with his classmates to barricade the door and hide.

“I’m so proud of him for doing that,” she said. “He was so brave.”

“It makes me scared to send him back,” Clark said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.”

Traffic going to the school was backed up for more than a mile as parents tried to get to their children. Barrow County schools will be closed for the rest of the week as they cooperate with the investigation, but grief counseling will be available.

“It’s just outrageous that every day, in our country, in the United States of America, that parents have to send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive,” Vice President Kamala Harris said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire.

In a message posted to social media, former President Donald Trump said: “These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster.” 

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who canceled a speech planned for the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas and returned to the state, said in a statement: “This is a day every parent dreads, and Georgians everywhere will hug their children tighter this evening because of this painful event.” 

Apalachee High School opened in 2000 and has about 1,900 students, according to records from Georgia education officials. 

On Wednesday evening, hundreds gathered in Jug Tavern Park in downtown Winder for a vigil. Volunteers handed out candles and also water, pizza and tissues. Some knelt as a Methodist minister led the crowd in prayer after a Barrow County commissioner read a Jewish prayer of mourning.

Some were clad in athletic gear from Apalachee’s crosstown rival, Winder-Barrow High School. At the end of the vigil, someone released balloons in Apalachee’s blue, gold and white. 

Sophomore Shantal Sanvee, who was in a classroom near the gunshots, said she saw “a whole lot of blood. And it was just, it was just horrible.”

“I don’t think I want to be here for like a long time now,” Sanvee said.

BALTIMORE (AP) — Derrick Henry is chugging along, and the Baltimore Ravens are on track following a rough start thanks to a tried-and-true recipe of running the ball early and often.
Henry’s 87-yard touchdown Sunday night was just the beginning of a 35-10 rout of the Buffalo Bills that gave the Ravens a second consecutive victory and got them back to .500. Henry, fellow running back Justice Hill and quarterback Lamar Jackson combined to rush for 271 yards — a ground game that reestablished Baltimore’s identity at the perfect time to turn their season around.
“That’s kind of always what we’ve been about,” coach John Harbaugh said. “Running the ball and playing great defense. ... The run game is massively important to us.”
Who better to lead that charge than Henry, the 247-pounder signed away from Tennessee in free agency to give Jackson a dependable runner. While Baltimore’s first two games brought a couple of touchdowns and mixed results, the past two have shown the good stuff that can happen when Henry has the ball in his hands.
The 30-year-old followed up his 151-yard, two-touchdown performance at Dallas with 199 yards on the ground against Buffalo. He also caught the fourth TD pass of his NFL career and first since 2019 and looks to be fitting in seamlessly in Baltimore’s offense.
“Everybody’s blocking,” said Henry, who has 49 carries over the last two weeks. “Everybody’s just being unselfish for me to have success, and I want to do the same for those guys.”


Henry ran roughshod over the Bills even with the banged up offensive line missing starting left guard Andrew Vorhees. Right tackle Patrick Mekari slid over to take his spot, rookie Roger Rosengarten made his first pro start and Henry and the Ravens did not miss a beat.

“He doesn’t need much to run: You give him a little sliver of space, he’s going to take advantage of it,” Rosengarten said. “He’s ‘King Henry’ for a reason and he shows it week in, week out. We just got to give him a chance, and he’ll do the rest.”
Unlike the previous two games, there was no real concern about blowing a late lead. Still, a three-and-out and a Buffalo touchdown to open the second half and cut the score to 21-10 got players worrying on the sideline.
“Everybody was like, ‘All right, we don’t need to do this again,’ so I think everybody locked in,” said safety Kyle Hamilton, who recovered Josh Allen’s fumble after Kyle Van Noy forced it. “Offense did their thing, and I think the defense settled down. There was a mistake that happened, but I think we did a good job of resetting and then doing what we needed to do to finish.”
From that point forward, the Ravens expanded their lead by 14 points and cruised.
After a turnover-free game against the Cowboys, Jackson lost a fumble and Henry lost the ball at the goal line before Patrick Ricard fell on it for a touchdown. Jackson was kicking himself for the mistake afterward.
“I was ticked off about that because in the NFL a lot of games are momentum type of games,” he said. “We scored three times, and then that fumble happened. It slows us down, but our defense was playing lights out.”
Fresh off signing a two-year, $6 million contract extension, Hill was Baltimore’s leading receiver with six catches for 78 yards and a touchdown, along with a handful of carries. He is showing to be the perfect backfield complement to Henry and a nice safety valve for Jackson, who said Hill “makes himself look good,” not the other way around.
“Justice Hill has been very integral,” Harbaugh said. “I’m just really glad we got him re-signed before he broke out in the last two games. That was nice.”
Mark Andrews was one of Jackson’s favorite options the past six seasons, a stretch that including being the All-Pro choice at tight end in 2021. He had an open-field drop Sunday night after Isaiah Likely made a 26-yard grab, and Andrews might be losing his grip on the top spot at the position on his own team.
In addition to Vorhees, nose tackle Michael Pierce missed the Bills game because of a shoulder injury. Cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis (hamstring) went on injured reserve and is out at least the next three games.
21 — Number of prime-time wins for the Ravens in 24 games since Harbaugh took over in 2008.
Harbaugh and his players wanted to turn the page quickly to their next game, on Sunday at AFC North rival Cincinnati, after the Bengals picked up their first victory of the season. The Ravens opened as 2 1/2-point road favorites on BetMGM Sportsbook.

Publication date:2024-09-12 07:00:00

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Francis Ford Coppola has sued Variety, saying that a July story that said he ran an unprofessional set with impunity and touching and tried to kiss female extras during the production of his film “Megalopolis” was false and libelous.
The suit, which seeks at least $15 million from the entertainment trade publication, was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday, two weeks before the director’s long-dreamed-of and self-financed epic is to be released in U.S. theaters.
The suit calls the 85-year-old director of “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now” a “creative genius” and says others are “jealous” and therefore tell “knowing and reckless falsehoods.”
It says Variety’s “writers and editors, hiding behind supposedly anonymous sources, accused Coppola of manifest incompetence as a motion picture director, of unprofessional behavior on the set of his most recent production, Megalopolis, of setting up some type of scheme so that anyone on the set who had a complaint of harassment or otherwise had nowhere to lodge a complaint, and of hugging topless actresses on the set. Each of these accusations was false.”
The lawsuit also names the story’s reporters, Brent Lang and Tatiana Siegel, as defendants.
It repeatedly says Variety was either knowingly publicizing falsehoods or showing reckless disregard for the truth, echoing a standard for libel established by the U.S. Supreme Court.


A Variety spokesperson, Jeffrey Schneider, told The Associated Press, “While we will not comment on active litigation, we stand by our reporters.”
Coppola said in a statement Thursday that nothing in his career compares to the difficult yet triumphant efforts to make “Megalopolis.” 
“It was a collaboration of hundreds of artists, from extras to box office stars, to whom I consistently displayed the utmost respect and my deepest gratitude,” Coppola said. “To see our collective efforts tainted by false, reckless and irresponsible reporting is devastating.”
The July 26 story used anonymous reports and videos from crew members of the shooting for “Megalopolis” of a nightclub scene in an Atlanta concert hall in February, 2023. The story said Coppola tried to kiss young female extras and “appeared to act with impunity” on the set. It said the film’s financial arrangements meant “there were none of the traditional checks and balances in place.”
In one video, Coppola, wearing a white suit, walks through a dancing crowd, stopping to apparently lean in to several young women to hug them, kiss them on the cheek or whisper to them. Another video shows him leaning into a woman who pulls away and shakes her head.
All of the women have tops on, and the Variety story mentions “topless” extras only in reference to an original report on the allegations in the Guardian.
In a subsequent story about a week later, which is mentioned only parenthetically in Coppola’s lawsuit, one of the women, Lauren Pagone, spoke to Variety and agreed to be identified, saying Coppola left her “in shock” when he touched, hugged and kissed her without her consent.
Pagone said she came forward because another of the extras, Rayna Menz, said in Variety’s sister publication Deadline that Coppola did nothing to make her or anyone else on the set uncomfortable.
Pagone also filed a lawsuit Monday against Coppola in Georgia, alleging that her treatment on the set amounted to civil assault and civil battery.
Asked for a specific response to that lawsuit, a Coppola representative said there would be no immediate comment beyond the director’s broader statement. 
The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Pagone has.
Asked about the touching and kissing allegations by The AP before the lawsuit was filed, Coppola said, “I don’t even want to (talk about it). It’s a waste of time.”
Later in the same interview, without being asked about the subject again, Coppola said “I’m very respectful of women. I always have been. My mother taught me — she was a little nuts — she said, ‘Francis if you ever make a pass at a girl, that means you disrespect her.’ So I never did.”
The lawsuit takes particular issue with an assertion in the Variety story that Coppola inadvertently got into a shot and ruined it. The suit says Coppola was well aware that some camera angles would include him, and that he was supposed to appear in the scene anyway.
“The average reader would understand that Coppola was so aged and infirm that he no longer knew how to direct a motion picture,” the suit says.

PRAGUE (AP) — The former head of the Czech Football Association was convicted of fraud again on Tuesday and sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison.
Prague’s Municipal Court also fined Miroslav Pelta 5 million Czech crowns ($221,000) and banned him from any executive position for five years.
The court issued the verdict in a retrial of the case after it handed Pelta similar sentences in 2021 and 2023. An appeals court canceled those rulings and returned the case back to the original court.
In the same case, the court also sentenced Simona Kratochvilova, a former deputy education minister, to six years in prison, banned her from working in public offices for six years, and fined her 2 million Czech crowns ($88,000).
The two pleaded not guilty and still can appeal.
The case dates to 2017 when police raided the association headquarters and the offices of FK Jablonec, a provincial soccer club partly owned by Pelta.
Prosecutors said the reason for the raids was an investigation of suspected fraud involving Pelta in connection with state subsidies.
The court said Pelta used his personal relationship with Kratochvilova to influence who would receive state subsidies worth 176 million Czech crowns ($7.8 million). Pelta resigned from his post a month after he was detained in May 2017.
Also, Education Minister Katerina Valachova resigned because of the scandal though she was not a suspect but a witness.

BALTIMORE (AP) — Investigators working to pinpoint the cause of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse discovered a loose cable that could have caused electrical issues on the Dali, the massive cargo ship that lost power and disastrously veered off course before striking the bridge. 
When disconnected, the problematic cable triggered an electrical blackout on the ship similar to what happened as it approached the bridge on March 26, according to new documents released Wednesday by the National Transportation Safety Board.
The documents don’t include any analysis or conclusions, which will be released later in the board’s final report. A spokesperson for the board declined to comment as the investigation is ongoing. 
The Dali was leaving Baltimore bound for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. It crashed into one of the bridge’s supporting columns, destroying the 1.6-mile span and killing six members of a roadwork crew.
Safety investigators released a preliminary report earlier this year that documented a series of power issues on the ship before and after its departure from Baltimore. But the new records offer more details about how its electrical system may have failed in the critical moments leading up to the deadly disaster.
The Dali first experienced a power outage when it was still docked in Baltimore. That was after a crew member mistakenly closed an exhaust damper while conducting maintenance, causing one of the ship’s diesel engines to stall, according to the earlier report. Crew members then made changes to the ship’s electrical configuration, switching from one transformer and breaker system — which had been in use for several months — to a second that was active upon its departure.


That second transformer and breaker system is where investigators found the loose cable, according to investigative reports.
Investigators also removed an electrical component from the same system for additional testing, according to a supplemental report released in June. They removed what is called a terminal block, which is used to connect electrical wires.
Engineers from Hyundai, the manufacturer of the ship’s electrical system, said the loose cable could create an open circuit and cause a breaker to open, according to a 41-page report detailing tests completed on the Dali in the weeks after the collapse. The engineers disconnected the cable as part of a simulation, which resulted in a blackout on the ship.
Hyundai sent engineers from its headquarters in South Korea to help with the investigation in April.
The new documents also included various certificates issued after inspections of the Dali pertaining to its general condition and compliance with maritime safety regulations.
“It’s pretty clear that they think they’ve found an issue that could cause a blackout,” said Tom Roth-Roffy, a former National Transportation Safety Board investigator who focused on maritime investigations. He said the loose cable was in a critical place within the electrical system. 
He also noted that investigators have clearly taken a thorough approach and documented their findings well. The new documents suggest they found very few other problems as they combed through the various systems and machinery aboard the Dali. 
In terms of whether the loose connection suggests inadequate maintenance of the ship or other problems with the crew, Roth-Roffy said it seems like a toss-up. Checking hundreds or thousands of wires is a tedious and time-consuming process, he said, and there are any number of factors that could cause connections to loosen over time, including the constant vibrations on a ship. 
“To say that this should have been detected is probably true but somewhat unrealistic,” he said. “But the ship’s crew has ultimate responsibility for the proper maintenance and operation of the ship.”
The Dali left Baltimore for Virginia in late June. It was scheduled to undergo repairs there, and local media reported last week that it will sail to China, likely sometime later this month.

More than 10,000 workers at 25 hotels across the U.S. were on strike Monday after choosing Labor Day weekend to amplify their demands for higher pay, fairer workloads and the reversal of COVID-era cuts.
The UNITE HERE union, which represents the striking housekeepers and other hospitality workers, said 200 workers at the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor were the latest to walk off the job.
Nearly half of the striking workers – or 5,000 – are in Honolulu. That includes Briana Canencia, a food server for over a decade at a Marriott property who said she was on the picket line fighting for not only higher wages, but also respect amid reduced hours and increased workloads.
Canencia, who is Native Hawaiian, said she works a second job in order to provide for her two kids, and yet they live paycheck-to-paycheck. She said she worries that her family will soon be “ priced out of paradise.”
“It’s very important to me to be able to raise my children here and get them familiar with their ancestral home, because our blood is here, our family is here,” she said. “We deserve to be here.”
Thousands of workers are also on strike in Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego and San Jose, California. The strikes targeting Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt hotels were set to last one to three days.
UNITE HERE said a total of 15,000 workers have voted to authorize strikes, which could soon spread to other cities, including New Haven, Connecticut; Oakland, California; and Providence, Rhode Island.


Union President Gwen Mills says the strikes are part of long-standing battle to secure family-sustaining compensation for service workers on par with more traditionally male-dominated industries.
“Hospitality work overall is undervalued, and it’s not a coincidence that it’s disproportionately women and people of color doing the work,” Mills said.
Alma Navarro, 60, has worked as a banquet server in San Jose for more than half of her life. These days, her body moves slower than it used to. It’s part of the reason she says she wasn’t afraid to walk off the job this weekend.
“To tell you the truth, it was not hard because I know that we need change,” she said. For Navarro, who works at a Hilton property, that means improved health care coverage, a living wage and higher employer contributions to her pension.
Without those changes addressed in a new contract, she said she fears she won’t be able to retire or even visit a doctor if she’s sick or injured, which has been the case a few times in recent years. If Navarro isn’t scheduled to work at least 80 hours in a month, she loses her health insurance coverage.
“Whenever I don’t have coverage,” she said, “I just pray to God: Please don’t let me get sick this month.”
Unionized housekeepers want to reinstate automatic daily room cleaning at major hotel chains, saying they have been saddled with unmanageable workloads, or in many cases, fewer hours and a decline in income. Many hotels cut services during the coronavirus pandemic and never restored them.
But hotels say guests are no longer asking for daily room cleaning and some other services.
Hyatt and Hilton both said Monday that they have contingency plans in place to minimize the impact of the strikes at their hotels. Marriott didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Michael D’Angelo, the head of labor relations for Hyatt in the Americas, said in a statement Monday that the chain offers competitive wages and benefits, including in the markets where workers are striking. 
“We are disappointed that UNITE HERE has chosen to strike while Hyatt remains willing to negotiate,” D’Angelo said. “We look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees.” 
Hilton said through a spokesperson that it remains “committed to negotiating in good faith to reach fair and reasonable agreements that are beneficial to both our valued team members and to our hotels.”
UNITE HERE hopes to replicate its recent success in Southern California, where after repeated strikes it won significant wage hikes, increased employer contributions to pensions and fair workload guarantees in a new contract with 34 hotels. Under the contract, housekeepers at most hotels will earn $35 an hour by July 2027.
Those wins also follow what the Culinary Workers Union, UNITE HERE’s affiliate in Nevada, has described as the “ best contracts ever ” for tens of thousands of hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip that include a 32% pay increase over five years, housekeeping workload reductions and improved job security amid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Aaron Civale pitched six scoreless innings in his last start before the postseason and Joey Ortiz was a home run short of the cycle as the Milwaukee Brewers defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-2 on Thursday.
Civale (8-9) allowed three hits, struck out five and walked one. He is 6-1 with a 2.57 ERA in his last nine starts.
“He just continues to impress me as a pitcher,” Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. “In this day and age to see a pitcher like that … he had pinpoint control today.”
Ortiz, a rookie third baseman, tripled in third inning and came home on Brice Turang’s ground out to open the scoring. Ortiz also doubled in a run in the sixth to increase the Brewers’ lead to 5-0.
The National League Central champion Brewers will open a best-of-three NL Wild Card Series at home starting next Tuesday. They finish the regular season by hosting the contending New York Mets in a three-game series that begins Friday night.
Murphy would not commit to having Civale start in the wild-card round but sounded like he is leaning that way.
“I think the fact he’s got some years under his belt,” Murphy said. “He does provide an answer to navigate some innings against any kind of hitters. I think there’s a case for him for sure.”
Civale is just happy to be headed to the postseason after being acquired from Tampa Bay on July 3 in a trade.
“Everything has been good about it,” Civale said of being with the Brewers. “I’m just fortunate to have the opportunity here. I’m just enjoying the ride and taking it start by start.”


The Brewers have won five of their last seven games and went 46-35 on the road this season.
Blake Perkins and Gary Sanchez had two hits each for the Brewers and Turang drove in two runs. Devin Williams pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his 14th save in 15 opportunities.
Mitch Keller (11-12) lost his final start of the year, giving up three runs and six hits in five innings in the Pirates’ home finale. After the All-Star break, Keller went 1-7 with a 5.65 ERA in 12 starts.
“Up and down, up and down,” Keller said of his season. “There’s definitely a lot of highlights up there and definitely a lot of lowlights. But overall, a lot of good things to look back on and a lot of things to keep working for. I don’t know, it’s weird. I’m happy with it and also disappointed in some areas too.”
Eric Haase doubled in a run in the fifth inning then scored on Turang’s single to make it 3-0. Milwaukee added to the lead in the sixth on RBI doubles by Perkins and Ortiz.
Bryan De La Cruz broke up the Brewers’ shutout bid with a two-run home run in the seventh inning off Nick Mears, but the Pirates lost for the ninth time in 13 games. They finished with a 39-42 home record.
Nick Gonzales had two hits for the Pirates.
The Pirates had a season attendance of 1,720,321, nearly 100,000 more than last year and their best mark since 2017. Much of the attendance spike was attributable to the emergence of rookie pitcher Paul Skenes.
Brewers: Mears (right forearm inflammation) was activated from the 15-day injured list and RHP Kevin Herget was optioned to Triple-A Nashville.
Brewers: RHP Frankie Montas (7-11, 4.85) will start Friday night for Milwaukee while the Mets are undecided on a pitcher after being rained out Wednesday and Thursday in Atlanta.
Pirates: RHP Jared Jones (6-8, 4.14) will start the opener of a three-game series Friday night in New York against Yankees LHP Carlos Rodon (16-9, 3.98).

Publication date:2024-09-22 07:00:00

MILAN (AP) — Another early goal for Christian Pulisic, and this time a positive outcome for AC Milan.
Pulisic’s 10th-minute strike was canceled out by Federico Dimarco but Matteo Gabbia netted two minutes from time as the Rossoneri won 2-1 at Inter Milan on Sunday for their first derby victory since 2022.
Milan also prevented Inter from claiming what would have been a record seventh straight derby victory.
“It’s certainly one of the best days of my life but I’m really happy for the team because we were in a period where we weren’t happy with what we had done,” said Gabbia, who came through the youth team at Milan. 
“So I see my goal as the cherry on the cake but the cake is the entire team which really worked fantastically tonight.”
The win eased the pressure on Milan coach Paulo Fonseca after just one victory in his first five matches in charge, including a 3-1 defeat to Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday.
“For me it’s exactly the same, because I don’t look at anything, I don’t hear anything. It will be a week with a bit more confidence but for me what’s important is to continue to see the players believing in our ideas and working as they have done until now,” Fonseca said.
Earlier Sunday, new Roma coach Ivan Jurić got off to a super start as his team beat Udinese 3-0.
Pulisic had scored an early goal at San Siro against Liverpool and he did so again on Sunday. Henrikh Mkhitaryan tried to chest the ball down but Pulisic nipped in to steal it, used his speed to surge forward and his strength to hold off another three defenders as he did so, before firing into the bottom left corner.


Inter leveled in the 28th minute as Dimarco played a one-two with Lautaro Martínez, who managed to squeeze the ball back to him through a crowd of players and he drilled into the far bottom corner
The hosts had chances to turn the match around completely, with Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan pulling off a fantastic save to parry Marcus Thuram’s effort. 
Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer also made an important save in the opening minute of the second half to push away Rafael Leão’s header.
Milan was awarded a penalty in the 65th minute after Lautaro appeared to clear a corner with the help of his arm but, after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor, referee Maurizio Mariani revoked his decision — adjudging that the ball had come off the Inter forward’s shoulder.
It was end-to-end action at San Siro, with both goalkeepers regularly called into action and it was Milan which won the match at the death when Tijjani Reijnders whipped a free kick into the area and Gabbia headed into the top right corner — right in front of the end where the Rossoneri fans were sat.
“We didn’t behave as if we were a team, we should have done more, me first of all as I am the coach,” Inter’s Simone Inzaghi said. “Milan deservedly won. We had an off game. It wasn’t the usual Inter, we didn’t play our game, we didn’t defend ... I tried to change things but little changed. 
“It’s a defeat that hurts us, in a derby. We’ll analyze it and try to work even harder.”
A turbulent week for Roma ended with the team’s first win of the season.
Artem Dovbyk’s first-half goal and Paulo Dybala’s penalty at the start of the second period set Roma on its way before substitute Tommaso Baldanzi capped a dream debut for Jurić in the team’s first match since the surprise dismissal of Daniele De Rossi on Wednesday.
Many Roma fans were unhappy with the decision to fire De Rossi and a lot of their anger had been directed at CEO and general manager Lina Souloukou, who resigned earlier Sunday.
The Curva Sud — where Roma’s staunchest fans sit — was empty for the first half hour amid a fan protest, with a large banner displayed that read: “You do not respect our values and our icons, from today we go back to the old ways.”
There were also many banners around the stadium in support of De Rossi as well as chants for the former Roma captain.
Fiorentina and Bologna also got their first league wins of the season.
Albert Gudmundsson had the perfect debut as he converted two penalties – after coming on as a halftime substitute – to help Fiorentina fight back to beat Lazio 2-1, with the winning spot kick coming in the final minute.
Bologna won 2-1 at Monza.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Francine became a hurricane Tuesday evening as it barreled toward south Louisiana, strengthening over extremely warm Gulf waters as those in possible harm’s way rushed to complete storm preparations, filling sandbags, buying gas and stocking up on necessities for an expected landfall in the coming day.
Residents, especially in south Louisiana, have a 24-hour window to “batten down all the hatches,” Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry warned at midday while Francine was still a tropical storm. 
The freshly minted Category 1 hurricane packed top sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and forecasters warned it was expected to crash ashore Wednesday afternoon or evening in Louisiana with a potentially life-threatening storm surge and damaging winds — perhaps even as a Category 2 storm with winds of 96 to 110 mph (155 to 175 kph).
Ahead of the storm’s approach, lifelong New Orleans resident Roxanne Riley, 42, gathered water, snacks and other food from a Walmart and said she planned to stay at a family member’s house on high ground to avoid flooding. But she was ready to evacuate if things got worse.
“It’s very frustrating every time a storm comes in,” Riley said. “I’ll just make sure my car is ready to roll in case I need to go by tomorrow. I’m going to keep on checking to see what it’s looking like.”
By 8 p.m. EDT Tuesday, Francine was centered about 350 miles (560 kilometers) southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, and was moving northeast at 10 mph (17 kph), the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in an advisory.


A hurricane warning was in effect along the Louisiana coast from Cameron eastward to Grand Isle, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of New Orleans, according to the center. A storm surge warning stretched from the Mississippi-Alabama border to the Alabama-Florida border. Such a warning means there’s a chance of life-threatening flooding.
Once Francine makes landfall, Landry said, residents should stay in place rather than venturing out onto the roads and risk blocking first responders or utility crews working to repair power lines.
Helping Francine gain hurricane status Tuesday night were the Gulf’s exceedingly warm late-summer waters. Water temperatures are about 87 degrees (31 degrees Celsius) where Francine is located, said Brian McNoldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science.
“The ocean heat content averaged over the entire Gulf is the highest it’s been on record for the date,” McNoldy wrote on his blog.
In downtown New Orleans during the day, cars and trucks were lined up for blocks to collect sandbags from the parking lot of a local YMCA. CEO Erika Mann said Tuesday that 1,000 bags of sand had already been distributed by volunteers later Tuesday to people hoping to protect homes from possible flooding.
“I love that these are community people that came out,” Mann said. “It’s a beautiful effort to do what we do in New Orleans, we’re resilient and we come together to help in the times we need each other.”
One resident picking up sandbags was Wayne Grant, 33, who moved to New Orleans last year and was nervous for his first potential hurricane in the city. The low-lying rental apartment he shares with his partner had already flooded out in a storm the year before and he was not taking any chances this time around.
“It was like a kick in the face, we’ve been trying to stay up on the weather ever since,” Grant said. “We’re super invested in the place, even though it’s not ours.”
A little over three years after Hurricane Ida trashed his home in the Dulac community of coastal Louisiana’s Terrebonne Parish – and about a month after he finished rebuilding – Coy Verdin was preparing for another hurricane.
“We had to gut the whole house,” he recalled in a telephone interview, rattling off a memorized inventory of the work, including a new roof and new windows. 
Verdin, 55, strongly considered moving farther inland, away from the home where he makes his living on nearby Bayou Grand Caillou. After rebuilding, he said he’s there to stay.
“As long as I can. It’s getting rough, though,” he said. He was preparing to head north to ride out Francine with his daughter in Thibodaux, about a 50-minute drive away. “I don’t want to go too far so I can come back to check on my house.”
Landry said the Louisiana National Guard is being deployed to parishes that could be impacted by Francine. They are equipped with food, water, nearly 400 high-water vehicles, about 100 boats and 50 helicopters to respond to the storm, including possible search-and-rescue operations.
Francine is the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. There’s a danger of life-threatening storm surge as well as damaging hurricane-force winds, said Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist at the hurricane center.
There’s also the potential for 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain with the possibility of 12 inches (30 centimeters) locally across much of Louisiana and Mississippi through Friday morning, Reinhart said. That heavy rainfall could also cause considerable flash and urban flooding.
The hurricane center said eastern Mississippi and especially coastal parts of Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were at risk of “considerable” flash and urban flooding starting Wednesday. It said flooding was also “probable” further inland into the lower Mississippi Valley and lower Tennessee Valley from Wednesday through Friday as a disbanding Francine churns inland.
Francine is taking aim at a Louisiana coastline that has yet to fully recover since hurricanes Laura and Delta decimated Lake Charles in 2020, followed a year later by Hurricane Ida. Over the weekend, a 22-story building in Lake Charles that had become a symbol of storm destruction was imploded after sitting vacant for nearly four years, its windows shattered and covered in shredded tarps.
Francine’s storm surge on the Louisiana coast could reach as much as 10 feet (3 meters) from Cameron to Port Fourchon and into Vermilion Bay, forecasters said. 
“It’s a potential for significantly dangerous, life-threatening inundation,” said Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center, adding it could also send “dangerous, damaging winds quite far inland.”
He said landfall was likely somewhere between Sabine Pass — on the Texas-Louisiana line — and Morgan City, Louisiana, about 220 miles (350 kilometers) to the east.

No, this is not a typo or somebody’s idea of a joke: Illinois and Indiana, two perennial also-rans in the mighty Big Ten, are both 4-0 and sitting atop the conference standings.
The last time both of those schools were unbeaten after the first four games was in 1910. The last time Indiana and Illinois finished the same season with winning records was in 2007 — Indiana was 7-6, Illinois was 9-4.
A lot of football ranging from mediocre to bad has been played in Bloomington, Indiana, and Champaign, Illinois.
It’s been more than two decades since either school won a Big Ten title. Illinois coach Ron Turner did it in 2001 when he guided the Illini to a 10-2 finish. John Pont was the coach when Hoosiers last won a Big Ten crown in 1967.
So there hasn’t been much to crow about — until 2024.
Indiana beat FIU 31-7 in the opener, routed FCS squad Western Illinois in Week 2 and then grabbed everyone’s attention by going on the road and walloping new Big Ten member UCLA 42-13. Indiana came back the next week and beat Charlotte 52-14.
Indiana quarterback Kurtis Rourke, a transfer from Ohio who threw for 307 yards and four touchdowns against UCLA, is currently the top-rated quarterback in the conference. Wake Forest transfer Justice Ellison is among the top 10 in the conference with 290 rushing yards and four touchdowns going into Saturday’s game at Maryland (3-1).
“I think this team has learned a lot, and I think they’ve developed some pretty strong intangibles,” first-year Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said. “We certainly have strong character on this football team and a lot of really good guys as well as good players. We’re looking forward to what’s ahead. I think the whole key right now is maintaining our focus.”


Illinois under fourth-year coach Bret Bielema dispatched Eastern Illinois 45-0, got by then-No. 19 Kansas 23-17 and beat Central Michigan 30-9. The Illini showed they were no fluke last week with a 31-24 overtime win at then-No. 22 Nebraska.
Illinois debuted in the AP Top 25 two weeks ago and have moved up five spots to No. 19. They will look for their third win over a ranked team when they travel to No. 9 Penn State (3-0) on Saturday.
“I wanted those guys to understand, it’s great, right?,” Bielema said. “Now every week you kind of set the standard over again.”
The Illini’s Luke Altmyer, who transferred from Ole Miss last year, leads conference quarterbacks with 10 touchdown passes. He was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against Nebraska.
Besides Penn State, the other conference unbeatens are Ohio State, Oregon and Rutgers — all 3-0.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Italian rookie Sam Aldegheri won for the first time in the major leagues, allowing a run on three hits in six innings in the Los Angeles Angels’ 5-1 victory over the Texas Rangers on Friday night.
Aldegheri (1-1), the first major league pitcher born and raised in Italy, struck out seven and walked three in his second career start. Last Friday night, the 22-year-old left-hander gave up seven runs – two earned – in five innings in a 9-5 loss to Seattle.
Aldegheri, whose first exposure to the major leagues was watching videos of Dodgers star Clayton Kershaw on YouTube and streaming on Italian TV, said he has dreamed of this first win “a lot.”
“For sure it was something that I was looking to accomplish today, and I did it,” said Aldegheri, who began the season in Single-A ball in the Philadelphia organization, was acquired at the trade deadline and brought up from Double-A last Friday. “So, it feels really great.”
Aldegheri became the third Italian-born pitcher to win a major league game, the first since Marino Pieretti of the Chicago White Sox in 1949.
“This kid has an idea how to pitch,” Angels manager Ron Washington said, “and he showed that tonight.”
Logan O’Hoppe hit a three-run home run in the sixth inning.
O’Hoppe drove an 0-2 changeup out over the plate to deep left field off reliever José Ureña after Anthony Rendon reached on a fielding error by third baseman Josh Jung, and Mickey Moniak singled. It was O’Hoppe’s career-best 19th homer of the season.


The Angels took a 2-0 lead in the third off Gerson Garabito (0-2), who made his second start of the season and first since May 26. Zach Neto scored Brandon Drury while hitting into a bases-loaded double play, and Nolan Schanuel singled home Niko Kavadas.
Texas put runners on the corners in the sixth with none out on singles by Wyatt Langford and Jung. Adolis García hit a sacrifice fly, and Aldegheri settled down to retire Nathaniel Lowe and Ezequiel Duran on fly outs.
“Just couldn’t get it going offensively,” Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. “His fastball played up more than it looked like. We had a hard time with it.”
The Angels’ Taylor Ward singled and walked, extending his on-base streak to a season-best 16 games.
Two-time AL All-Star shortstop Elvis Andrus officially retired from Major League Baseball on Friday as a Ranger. The 36-year-old Andrus played the first 12 of 15 big league seasons with Texas.
Andrus said he was most proud “that I gave it everything I had every single day, every single year.”
The announcement was timed with the weekend visit of the Angels and Washington, who managed Andrus during his first six seasons.
“I’m just happy he made me a part of it,” Washington said.
Angels: RF Jo Adell left with left oblique irritation after striking out in the second inning and was replaced by Kevin Pillar.
Angels All-Star LHP Tyler Anderson (10-12, 3.55 ERA) was set to face rookie RHP Jack Leiter (0-2, 11.78) on Saturday night.

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — The death toll in the aftermath of Typhoon Yagi in Vietnam climbed to 233 on Friday as rescue workers recovered more bodies from areas hit by landslides and flash floods, state media reported. 
Flood waters from the swollen Red River in the capital of Hanoi were beginning to recede, but many neighborhoods remained inundated and farther north, experts were predicting it could still be days before any relief is in sight. 
Typhoon Yagi made landfall Saturday, setting off heavy rains that have triggered flash floods and landslides, particularly in Vietnam’s mountainous north. Across the country, 103 people are still missing and more than 800 have been injured. 
In a village on the outskirts of Hanoi, Nguyen Thi Loan returned to the home that she’d hastily fled on Monday as the floodwaters rose. Much of A Lac village was still under water, and as she surveyed the damage, she wondered how she and others would manage. 
“The flood has made our lives so difficult,” she said. “Our rice crop has been destroyed and at home the electrical appliances like the washing machine, TV and fridge are under water.”
Most fatalities have come in the province of Lao Cai, where a flash flood swept away the entire hamlet of Lang Nu on Tuesday. Eight villagers turned up safe on Friday morning, telling others that they had left before the deluge, state-run VNExpress newspaper said. However, 48 others from Lang Nu have been found dead, and another 39 remain missing.


Roads to Lang Nu have been badly damaged, making it impossible to bring in heavy equipment to aid in the rescue effort.
Some 500 personnel with sniffer dogs are on hand, and in a visit to the scene on Thursday, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh promised they would not relent in their search for those still missing.
“Their families are in agony,” Chinh said.
Coffins were stacked near the disaster site in preparation for the worst, and villager Tran Thi Ngan mourned at a makeshift altar for family members she had lost. 
“It’s a disaster,” she told VTV news. “That’s the fate we have to accept.”
In Cao Bang, another northern province bordering China, 21 bodies had been recovered by Friday, four days after a landslide pushed a bus, a car and several motorcycles into a small river, swollen with floodwaters. Ten more people remain missing. 
Experts say storms like Typhoon Yagi are getting stronger due to climate change, as warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel them, leading to higher winds and heavier rainfall.
The effects of the typhoon, the strongest to hit Vietnam in decades, were also being felt across the region, with flooding and landslides in northern Thailand, Laos and northeastern Myanmar.
In Thailand, 10 deaths have been reported due to flooding or landslides, and Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra flew to the north on Friday to visit the border town of Mae Sai. Thailand’s Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation warned of a continuing risk of flash floods in multiple areas through next Wednesday, as new rain was expected to increase the Mekong River’s levels further. 
In Myanmar, the army said Friday that at least 33 people died across the country since Wednesday. It said 187 relief camps have been established for nearly 240,000 flood victims from 34 townships.
There are fears the death toll may rise sharply as local news outlets reported dozens missing in floods and landslides in the central regions of Mandalay and Bago, as well as eastern Shan State and the country’s capital, Naypyitaw.
International aid has been flowing into Vietnam in the aftermath of Yagi, with Australia already delivering humanitarian supplies as part of $2 million in assistance.
South Korea has also pledged $2 million in aid, and the U.S. Embassy said Friday it would provide $1 million in support through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. 
“With more heavy rain forecast in the coming days, USAID’s disaster experts continue to monitor humanitarian needs in close coordination with local emergency authorities and partners on the ground,” the embassy said in a statement. “USAID humanitarian experts on the ground are participating in ongoing assessments to ensure U.S. assistance rapidly reaches populations in need.”
The typhoon and ensuing heavy rains have damaged factories in northern provinces like Haiphong, home to electric car company VinFast, Apple parts suppliers and other electronic manufacturers, which could affect international supply chains, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a research note. 
The center said 95% of businesses in Haiphong were to resume some activity on Sept. 10 but that “repair efforts will likely lower output for the next weeks and months.”

MASYAF, Syria (AP) — The number of people killed in overnight Israeli strikes in Syria has risen to 18 with dozens more wounded, Syria’s health minister said Monday — the largest death toll in such an attack since the beginning of the war in Gaza.
One of the sites targeted was a research center used in the development of weapons, a war monitor said. Syrian officials said civilian sites were targeted.
Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria linked to Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Those strikes have become more frequent as Hezbollah has exchanged fire with Israeli forces for the past 11 months against the backdrop of Israel’s war against Hamas — a Hezbollah ally — in Gaza.
However, the intensity and death toll of Sunday night’s strikes were unusual.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of war-torn Syria in recent years, but it rarely acknowledges or discusses the operations. The strikes often target Syrian forces or Iranian-backed groups.
Israel has vowed to stop Iranian entrenchment in Syria, particularly since Syria is a key route for Iran to send weapons to Hezbollah.
Israeli strikes hit several areas in central Syria, damaging a highway in Hama province and sparking fires, Syrian state news agency SANA said.
Speaking to reporters, Syrian Health Minister Hassan al-Ghabbash described the strikes as a “brutal and barbaric aggression.” He said the death toll had risen to 18 with nearly 40 wounded.


The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, said 25 were killed, including at least five civilians, while the others included Syrian army soldiers and members of Hezbollah and other Iran-linked armed groups.
One strike targeted a scientific research center in Masyaf, and other sites where “Iranian militias and experts are stationed to develop weapons in Syria,” the observatory said. It said the research center was reportedly used for developing weapons, including short- and medium-range precision missiles and drones.
Minister of Electricity Mohammad al-Zamel said the strikes had caused “truly significant” damage to water and electricity infrastructure.
“This brutal attack targeted civilian targets, and the martyrs were mostly civilians, as were the wounded,” he said.
Muhammad Sumaya, a firefighter with the Hama Fire Brigade, was wounded when shrapnel from one of the strikes hit his foot. 
When the strikes began, he said while being treated in the Masyaf hospital Monday, “we moved from one place to another to deal with the fires and work to extinguish them.” While they were working, he said, “a missile landed right next to us.”
Azzam al-Omar, a SANA photographer, said he was hit by shrapnel in the chest when a missile landed while he was photographing the aftermath of a strike. 
Local media also reported strikes around the coastal city of Tartous, which the observatory said were the result of air defense missiles falling.
On Monday afternoon, a charred car remained at the scene of one strike and smoke was still rising from some spots where fires had been put out.
Also on Monday, Saudi Arabia officially reopened its embassy in Damascus, marking a full restoration of relations between the two countries. 
Syria was widely shunned by Arab governments over the brutal crackdown by the government of Bashar Assas on protesters in a 2011 uprising that descended into civil war. The breakdown in relations culminated with Syria being ousted from the Arab League.
As Assad consolidated his control over most of the country and the civil war turned into a largely frozen conflict, Arab states moved toward a rapproachement with Damascus.
Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic relations with Syria in 2012. Last year, soon after Syria was reinstated to the Arab League, the two countries announced they were restoring relations.

GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) — Second-seeded Danielle Collins lost in the second round of the Guadalajara Open on Wednesday and third seed Victoria Azarenka withdrew from her match because of injury. 
Qualifier Olivia Gadecki, ranked No. 152, pulled off a major upset with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Collins to reach the quarterfinals of an elite WTA tournament for the first time. She beat former U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the first round.
The 30-year-old Collins, who is retiring at the end of the season, arrived at Guadalajara with 39 tour-level wins and two titles on tour this year and is currently ranked 11th. She committed 35 unforced errors and had eight double-faults, extending her streak to three losses since retiring from the third set of her quarterfinal against top-ranked Iga Swiatek at the Paris Olympics.
Earlier, Kamilla Rakhimova advanced to the quarterfinals after two-time major winner and former No. 1-ranked Victoria Azarenka retired from their match with a right shoulder injury in the second set while trailing 6-2, 3-0.
Rakhimova will next play Camila Osorio, who rallied from 0-5 down in the third set to upset seventh-seeded Veronika Kudermetova 7-6, 6-7 (2), 7-5 in 3 hours and 21 minutes.
The tournament is played in hard-court at the Complejo Panamericano de Tenis, in Guadalajara.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Officials say two people were badly burned and two others are believed to be dead after an explosion and fire destroyed a gas station in a small north-central Idaho town.
The explosion at the Atkinson Distributing station in Cardiff was reported just after 3 p.m. Wednesday, the Clearwater County Sheriff’s office said in a news release, and two people with severe burns were flown by air ambulance to a hospital in a nearby city. More people were believed to be inside the building, the sheriff’s office said, but no additional details were released. 
Another two people were also taken to area hospitals, said Idaho State Fire Marshal Knute Sandahl on Thursday, but the nature of their injuries was not known. 
“It’s a pretty devastating incident. I believe there have been structures destroyed besides the gas station, and there is a pretty large debris field,” that covers an area roughly the size of two city blocks, Sandahl said. 
Jeff Adams, a manager with Atkinson Distributing, said Thursday that the people who were flown to a hospital burn center in Seattle are Atkinson employees. Both were in critical condition, he said. 
“Evidentially there were a couple of customers in the store that did not get out,” Adams said. “We’d like to extend our prayers to everybody, and thank the first responders and everybody who turned out to try to help. We very much appreciate it.” 


A fuel tanker was offloading fuel at the station when the explosion occurred, Adams said, but it wasn’t yet known what caused the explosion.
“We’re just like everybody else — we’re waiting around trying to get information,” Adams said. “When we went up there last night, they wouldn’t let us get anywhere near it.” 
Sandahl said two of his deputy fire marshals are at the station to investigate, and they are being assisted by a special agent from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The remote mountain town does not have cell service, and Sandahl did not yet have any details about the explosion.
“Unfortunately the flow of information is kind of difficult without any cell service,” Sandahl said. “They’re still sifting through the debris.” 
The Cardiff gas station is only staffed during the logging season, according to the company’s website, and it includes a small convenience store with snacks and drinks.",False

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Tyreek Hill of the Miami Dolphins was handcuffed and placed face down on a street outside the team’s stadium after he was stopped for speeding and reckless driving Sunday morning before the Dolphins’ first game of the season, an incident that left the star wide receiver baffled and resulted in a police officer being placed on administrative leave.
The officer, who was not identified, was one of at least three involved in detaining Hill. Some fans saw Hill being handcuffed and captured video on their way to the game, and it quickly went viral on social media.
Miami-Dade Police director Stephanie V. Daniels said she had launched an internal affairs investigation.
Told after the game that the officer was placed on leave pending the outcome of the investigation, Hill said: “That should tell you everything you need to know.”
Added defensive tackle Calais Campbell, who was also briefly handcuffed after coming to his teammate’s aid: “That makes sense based on the situation.”
Hill, who said he respects police officers and wants to be one when he retires from football, said he “had no idea” why police placed him in handcuffs.
“I wasn’t disrespectful because my mom didn’t raise me that way,” Hill said. “Didn’t cuss. Didn’t do none of that. Like I said, I’m still trying to figure it out, man.”
Hill starred on the field for the Dolphins, catching seven passes for 130 yards — including an 80-yard touchdown that helped Miami rally for a 20-17 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Hill celebrated the score by mimicking being handcuffed.


Hill, who is Black, said he didn’t want to use his celebrity to get out of the situation but wondered what would’ve happened if he weren’t an NFL star.

“I don’t want to bring race into it, but sometimes it gets kind of iffy when you do,” he said. “What if I wasn’t Tyreek Hill? Lord knows what that guy or guys would have done. I was just making sure that I was doing what my uncle always told me to do whenever you’re in a situation like that: ‘Just listen, put your hands on the steering wheel and just listen.’”
Daniels said in a statement earlier Sunday that she requested an “immediate review” of the details surrounding the incident, adding that the department would review available body camera footage.

In a later statement, Daniels said: “I’m committed to transparency and accountability to the community with any situation involving my officers.”
Hill said everything happened so fast it caught him off guard.
“I’m just glad that my teammates were there to support me in that situation because I felt alone,” Hill added.
Campbell said he was driving into Hard Rock Stadium when he saw Hill handcuffed, and he stopped to help. The 17-year NFL veteran ended up in handcuffs as well, saying officers told him it was because he disobeyed their direct orders.
“I’d seen, I feel like excessive force, so I get out of the car to kind of just try to de-escalate the situation,” Campbell said, also calling the incident “a bit extreme.”
Hill, who led the NFL in receiving yards in 2023, said he spoke to his wife and family after he was detained and before the game kicked off.
His agent, Drew Rosenhaus, called it a “heartbreaking situation” on ESPN.
“How things escalated into the situation that they were in, in handcuffs and being held on the ground with police, is mindboggling to me,” Rosenhaus said. “I’m deeply concerned by that. Very troubled. We will be looking into it. We will be investigating this. We will look out for Tyreek, but I’m not going to make any allegations at this time. The most important thing is Tyreek is OK physically, mentally he was very distraught about what happened.”
It isn’t the first off-field incident involving Hill.
He was accused of punching his girlfriend in college and got kicked off the team at Oklahoma State. In 2019, prosecutors in suburban Kansas City declined to charge Hill after an alleged domestic violence incident involving his fiancee and their 3-year-old child.
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league has been in contact with the Dolphins about Sunday’s incident, but declined to comment further.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A man accused of dousing gasoline on an Ugandan Olympic athlete, causing her death days later, has succumbed to burns sustained in the attack, according to the Kenyan hospital where he was treated.
Dickson Ndiema was admitted at the Moi Referral Hospital in the western Eldoret city for burns covering 30% of his body. Ndiema is alleged to have sustained the injuries after setting on fire Olympic athlete Rebecca Cheptegei, who died last Thursday with 80% of burns on her body. 
The hospital spokesperson, Owen Menach, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the hospital would issue a statement later but confirmed that the patient had died.
Ndiema and Cheptegei were said to have quarreled over a piece of land that the athlete bought in Kenya, according to a report filed by the local chief.
Cheptegei competed in the women’s marathon at the Paris Olympics less than a month before the attack. She finished in 44th place.
Cheptegei’s parents said their daughter bought land in the Trans Nzoia county to be near Kenya’s many athletic training centers. 
The athlete’s father, Joseph Cheptegei, told reporters last week that Ndiema, his daughter’s former boyfriend, was stalking and threatening her and the family had informed police.
He said he wanted justice and lamented that the suspect was not being guarded at his hospital bed and expressed concern that he might escape. 
Cheptegei is expected to be buried at her home in Uganda on Saturday.",False

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to strike deeper into Russia after a meeting between U.S. and British leaders a day earlier produced no visible shift in their policy on the use of long-range weapons.
The renewed appeal came as Kyiv said Russia launched more drone and artillery attacks into Ukraine overnight.
“Russian terror begins at weapons depots, airfields and military bases inside the Russian Federation,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said Saturday. “Permission to strike deep into Russia will speed up the solution.”
Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called on allies to greenlight the use of Western-provided long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine.
Discussions on allowing long-range strikes were believed to be on the table when U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington on Friday but no decision was announced immediately.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressing the U.S. and other allies to allow his forces to use Western weapons to target air bases and launch sites farther afield as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and utilities before winter. 
He did not directly comment on the meeting Saturday morning, but said that more than 70 Russian drones had been launched into Ukraine overnight. The Ukrainian air force later said that 76 Russian drones had been sighted, of which 72 were shot down.


“We need to boost our air defense and long-range capabilities to protect our people,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media. “We are working on this with all of Ukraine’s partners.”
Other overnight attacks saw one person killed by Russian artillery fire as energy infrastructure was targeted in Ukraine’s Sumy region. A 54-year-old driver was killed and seven more people were hospitalized, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.
Another three people died Saturday in a Russian strike on an agricultural enterprise in the front-line town of Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, Gov. Ivan Fedorov said.
Meanwhile, officials in Moscow have continued to make public statements warning that long-range strikes would provoke further escalation between Russia and the West. The remarks are in line with the narrative the Kremlin has promoted since early in the war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told state news agency Tass on Saturday that the U.S. and British governments were pushing the conflict, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, toward “poorly controlled escalation.”
Biden on Friday brushed off similar comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said on Thursday that allowing long-range strikes “would mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries, are at war with Russia.” 
Asked what he thought about Putin’s threat, Biden answered, “I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin.”
Russian and Ukrainian officials also announced on Saturday a prisoner swap brokered by the United Arab Emirates. It included 206 prisoners on both sides, including Russians captured in Ukraine’s incursion in the Kursk region.
The swap is the eighth of its kind since the beginning of 2024, and puts the total number of POWs exchanged at 1,994. Previous exchanges were also brokered by the UAE. 
Both sides released images of soldiers traveling to meet friends and family, with Zelenskyy commenting, “Our people are home.”
Elsewhere, Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones had been shot down over the country’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. 
A woman also died Saturday after a Ukrainian shell hit her home in the border village of Bezlyudovka, Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Christine Sinclair, one of the founding players for the Portland Thorns in the National Women’s Soccer League, announced Friday that she retiring from the game.
Sinclair will finish out the season with the Thorns, who plan to honor her before the final regular-season home game on Nov. 1.
The 41-year-old Sinclair retired from the Canadian national team last year, finishing her international career as the world’s top goal scorer among both women and men with 190 goals.
Sinclair is among just three active players in the NWSL who have played for the same team since the league launched in 2013.
She announced her retirement on social media.
“For the last 11 years it has been an honor to be part of the Portland Thorns organization. The club that showed the world what is possible when women’s sports are invested in,” she wrote. “As I finish out this last ride, I want to say what a privilege it has been to represent this unique, beautiful and passionate city that I will always call home.” 
Sinclair also wrote that she plans to continue “growing the game that I love while inspiring the next generation.”
She helped the Thorns win the inaugural NWSL championship before adding additional titles in 2017 and 2022. She scored Portland’s first-ever goal in a match against FC Kansas City on April 13, 2013.
She has scored a club-record 64 regular-season goals with the team, ranking her third all-time in the league. She has played in a Portland-record 195 games, including 176 starts. 


She has 79 goals across all competitions with the Thorns. 
With the Canadian national team, Sinclair won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics. She earned bronze medals at both the 2012 and 2016 Games.
She is also among just five players to appear in six Women’s World Cups, and one of just three players to score in five. But a World Cup trophy eluded her.
Sinclair, who is from Burnaby, British Columbia, near Vancouver, also won NCAA championships with the University of Portland in 2002 and 2005.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Napheesa Collier scored a playoff career-high 38 points and the Minnesota Lynx blew a 23-point lead before rallying late to beat the Phoenix Mercury 102-95 on Sunday in Game 1 of a best-of-three series.
Minnesota, the Western Conference champions and No. 2 seed, turned a 32-19 first-quarter lead into a 50-27 advantage with 5:35 left before halftime. Phoenix whittled nine points off its deficit, trailing 56-42 at intermission, and closed within 77-69 heading to the fourth quarter.
Kahleah Copper scored five points in a 10-2 run and her 3-pointer followed by two free throws by Brittney Griner gave seventh-seeded Phoenix its first lead since scoring the first four points of the game. Natasha Cloud’s layup put the Mercury on top 92-91 with 2:06 left to play, but Myisha Hines-Allen answered with a layup and Bridget Carleton hit a 3-pointer in a 9-0 spurt to pull out the victory.
Collier sank 11 of 19 shots from the floor with three 3-pointers and 13 of 14 free throws for Minnesota. She added six rebounds and four assists. Kayla McBride hit three 3-pointers and all seven of her foul shots, scoring 20. Carleton had 12 points, six boards and four assists, and Hines-Allen added 10 points, five rebounds and three assists off the bench.
Cloud had 33 points, matching her postseason high, and 10 assists to lead Phoenix. Diana Taurasi made half of her 10 3-point attempts and scored 21. Copper added 16 points, and Griner finished with 10 points and six rebounds.


Collier finished four points shy of Breanna Stewart’s playoff-record 42-point effort. Stewart scored 42 points while playing for the Seattle Storm in a 97-92 loss to the Las Vegas Aces in Game 4 of a Western Conference semifinal in 2022.
Minnesota won three of four games — all by double digits — against Phoenix during the regular season. The Mercury beat the visiting Lynx 81-80 for their lone victory.
The Lynx will host Game 2 at the Target Center on Wednesday. Phoenix would host Game 3 on Friday, if necessary.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Star right fielder Fernando Tatis Jr. was activated from the 60-day injured list Monday by the San Diego Padres after being sidelined for more than two months with a stress reaction in his right thighbone.
He went 0 for 4, but did advance two runners in the two-run eighth inning in a 3-0 win against the Detroit Tigers.
Tatis last played on June 21. He was put on the injured list on June 24, retroactive to June 22.
He received ovations when the lineups were announced and when he ran out to his defensive position at the start of the game, when he was gesturing to the fans and clapping.
“It’s a beautiful feeling, man,” he said. “I wish I could put it into words, but I had goosebumps, and my energy went right through the roof. And that was the push that I definitely needed and it was just beautiful all the way around.”
He spent last week working out at the team’s spring training complex in Arizona.
Tatis received a warm welcome in the clubhouse, including an emphatic hug with center fielder Jackson Merrill, considered by some to be the leading contender for NL Rookie of the Year.
“I’m in a really good place right now,” Tatis said before the game. “It’s not 100%, but I’ve been cleared from the doctors and I feel really good moving forward. I feel really confident and I feel like I can do anything out there on the baseball field.”
On the day he was placed on the IL, Tatis said he had been dealing with the injury for essentially the whole season. It was first described as a quadriceps injury, but the team discovered the stress reaction after imaging.


The Padres moved past Arizona and into the NL’s first wild-card spot.
“I’m really excited to just come and join the squad,” Tatis said. “Just add a little bit more to what this group has been doing. I said the day I was going down this is a special group and I know they’re going to be playing good baseball, and the boys have been handling it the right way.”
Tatis won the NL Gold Glove and Platinum Glove awards last year in his first season in right field.
He was an All-Star at shortstop in 2021 before missing the 2022 season due to injury and a PED suspension.
Tatis was hitting .279 with 14 home runs and 36 RBIs when he went on the IL.
Merrill said he’s “ecstatic” that Tatis is back.
“Energy is contagious. It’s going to rub off on everybody, especially his energy, his swagger. It’s huge,” Merrill said.
“It’s fun to write him in there. He brings a lot to the table, obviously,” manager Mike Shildt said.
Outfielder Bryce Johnson was optioned to Triple-A El Paso.

LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) — Former world champion Gennady Golovkin is taking a leading role in World Boxing, the group aiming to keep the sport on the Olympic program for the 2028 Los Angeles Games.
World Boxing said on Thursday that Golovkin would chair an “Olympic commission” tasked with persuading the International Olympic Committee that the breakaway organization founded last year is fit to run the competitions in Los Angeles.
“For me, personally, as well as for all the sports world, it is important to preserve boxing as an Olympic sport, and this will be my top priority,” Golovkin said in a statement. “I also intend to work closely with the IOC on issues of boxing’s commitment to the Olympic values of honesty, fairness and transparency.”
Golovkin won an Olympic silver medal in 2004 and, after turning pro, was a longtime world middleweight champion who fought in some of the most lucrative bouts of all time, finishing with a 42-2-1 record. Since retirement, he has become president of Kazakhstan’s national Olympic committee.
Boxing’s Olympic status is uncertain. The IOC has set a deadline of early next year for a credible governing body to be in place after years of turmoil with the International Boxing Association. 
The IOC ran the last two Olympic tournaments on its own after first suspending and then banishing the IBA from the Games and has said it no longer wishes to organize the tournament in-house.


World Boxing lists 44 national governing bodies as members including the United States, Britain and India. It most recently added Japan and Algeria, whose federation is home to Paris Olympic gold medalist Imane Khalif.
Kazakhstan’s national boxing federation isn’t a World Boxing member for now, but said on Thursday it applied for membership around the same time that Golovkin’s new role was announced.
Kazakhstan is regularly among the top medal-winning nations in Olympic boxing and would be World Boxing’s 10th member in Asia.

TOKYO (AP) — Small tsunami waves splashed ashore on remote Japanese islands Tuesday morning after an earthquake that may have been triggered by volcanic activity.
The offshore quake was not felt, and the tsunami advisory was lifted about three hours later. No damage or injuries were reported.
The Japan Meteorological Agency had advised that waves up to 1 meter (yard) above tide levels could occur on the coasts of the Izu and Ogasawara island chains after the magnitude 5.8 quake occurred off the Izu Islands. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake’s strength at 5.6 magnitude.
About 21,500 people live on the islands in the Izu group and about 2,500 on the Ogasawara Islands.
JMA said a tsunami of about 50 centimeters (about 20 inches) was detected in the Yaene district on Hachijo Island about 30 minutes after the quake. Smaller waves were detected on three other islands — Kozushima, Miyakejima and Izu Oshima.
The offshore quake occurred about 180 kilometers (111 miles) south of Hachijo island, which is about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of Tokyo.
Television footage showed waves splashing against a wharf on Hachijo island but no major swelling was seen.
Residents on Hachijo said they did not feel the quake and only heard the tsunami advisory, Japan’s NHK public television said.
Ryuji Minemoto, a Hachijo resident, told NHK that he was on high ground overlooking the ocean but didn’t notice changes in the water. “I can see some ships but they don’t seem to be moving violently,” he said. Minemoto said he did not feel the earlier quake.


Fumihiko Imamura, a Tohoku University seismologist, said the tsunami is believed to be related to undersea volcanic activity that might have caused a rise or sinking of parts of the seabed. Imamura told NHK that such movement, unlike ordinary quakes, may not have caused rattling.
Japan sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the world’s most earthquake and tsunami-prone countries.",False

Holy Cross (1-3) at Syracuse (2-1), Saturday, 12 p.m. ET (ACC Extra/ESPN+)
BetMGM College Football Odds: Syracuse by 28 1/2.
Series record: Syracuse leads 24-5.
With the meat of its schedule approaching, Syracuse needs to shake off last week’s disheartening, last-second home loss against Stanford. Anything less than a dominating effort against the FCS Crusaders will be cause for concern. Holy Cross will try to keep things reasonably close and hope for a moral victory before moving into Patriot League play.
Holy Cross may be able to keep it close for a half if the Crusaders’ running game can make some plays against Syracuse’s inconsistent rushing defense, which is 104th in the nation. Syracuse’s offensive line versus the Crusaders front will be one to watch. Syracuse quarterback Kyle McCord was sacked four times against Stanford, and the running game managed just 26 yards. The Orange must show improvement in protecting their quarterback and opening up holes to gear up to face much tougher competition starting with UNLV on Oct. 4.
Holy Cross: Linebacker Frankie Monte had a career-best 17 tackles, including 10 solo tackles, and a quarterback hurry against Yale. He can’t do it alone but it will be interesting to see if he and his defensive crew can wreak some havoc to disrupt the Orange running game. 
Syracuse: Tight end Oronde Gadsden II was double covered during most of the Stanford outing, and had just two receptions for 12 yards. This is what the pre-season All-ACC selection can expect to see the rest of the way. How the Orange work him into the offense will be key, starting with the Crusaders.


The Crusaders have forced 10 fumbles, recovered six and have two interceptions. … Syracuse is 21-0 against FCS teams. … McCord is just the third Syracuse quarterback to throw for 300 yards in three straight games. … He’s third in the nation and second in the ACC in passing yards per game. … Syracuse is fourth in the nation in passing offense and 117th in rushing offense. … In closing an opening schedule with four straight home games, the Orange hit the road for three straight outings before returning home to host Virginia Tech on Nov. 2. ... Monte earned Patriot League defensive player of the week honors. ... The Crusaders’ three losses have been decided by a combined 11 points following a 38-31 loss to Yale last weekend. Their lone win was a 43-22 decision over Bryant two weeks ago.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The quarterback competition at Pittsburgh is over.
Coach Pat Narduzzi named Eli Holstein the starter for Saturday’s game at Cincinnati (1-0), taking away the “or” that linked Holstein and Nate Yarnell when the team’s first official depth chart was released last week.
Holstein, a transfer from Alabama, separated himself from Yarnell by throwing for 336 yards and three touchdowns in a 55-24 victory over Kent State in the opener. The 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman completed 30 of 40 passes, looking at ease in first-year offensive coordinator Kade Bell’s up-tempo attack.
Narduzzi saw enough that he did away with any pretense before facing the Bearcats, saying Monday that Holstein has earned the starting job until further notice.
“You look at the tape and he just made really good decisions,” Narduzzi said. “He’s calm. It’s his first start; you never knew what was going to happen. But Eli was impressive on game tape.”
Holstein’s 336 yards passing were the second most in school history by a freshman in his first start. Yet it wasn’t just the numbers that stood out to Narduzzi, but also the way Holstein looked at ease directing an entirely new offense.
“Just his composure on game day, how he carried himself, how he led the offense, how there wasn’t a bunch of false starts and mechanical issues as far as just the operation,” Narduzzi said. “It was a clean start. That’s tough to do for a redshirt freshman.”


Yarnell ended last season as the starter and was atop the depth chart at the beginning of training camp last month only to see Holstein — who was limited by a hamstring injury during spring drills — steadily make inroads until he pulled even. Though Narduzzi named Holstein the starter for the opener, he stressed at the time that both quarterbacks would play.
Yet by the time Yarnell saw the field, the Panthers were well in front thanks to Holstein. Yarnell did throw for 33 yards and a touchdown to finish the blowout, but Holstein’s play made Narduzzi’s choice going forward an easy one, though Narduzzi was quick to praise Yarnell for the way he’s handled the news.
“He knows it’s a long season,” Narduzzi said. “We all know it’s a long season. If we get our quarterback hit like we did last week, Nate will be the guy in there, and we’ve got a heck of a lot of confidence in him.”
Pass protection was an issue briefly early against the Golden Flashes, with Holstein taking three sacks. It didn’t impact the outcome, and Pitt ran off 80 plays, which is about the speed Bell wants the offense to play at going forward.
“The tough part is you’re trying to run it fast as an offense and everybody is getting lined up quick,” Narduzzi said. “Again, to Eli’s credit and Nate’s credit, those guys were getting lined up and a lot of times you’ve got to make sure they’re all lined up before you snap the ball. Someone is making sure they’re on or off the line of scrimmage, and we didn’t have any of those, and we moved pretty quick, so I think it’s only going to get better.”

NEW YORK (AP) — They have millions of followers online. They have been major players in right-wing political discourse since Donald Trump was president. And they worked unknowingly for a company that was a front for a Russian influence operation, U.S. prosecutors say.
An indictment filed Wednesday alleges a media company linked to six conservative influencers — including well-known personalities Tim Pool, Dave Rubin and Benny Johnson — was secretly funded by Russian state media employees to churn out English-language videos that were “often consistent” with the Kremlin’s “interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition” to Russian interests, like its war in Ukraine. 
In addition to marking the third straight presidential election in which U.S. authorities have unveiled politically charged details about Russia’s attempted interference in U.S. politics, an indictment indicates how Moscow may be attempting to capitalize on the skyrocketing popularity of right-wing podcasters, livestreamers and other content creators who have found successful careers on social media in the years since Trump was in office.
The U.S. Justice Department doesn’t allege any wrongdoing by the influencers, some of whom it says were given false information about the source of the company’s funding. Instead, it accuses two employees of RT, a Russian state media company, of funneling nearly $10 million to a Tennessee-based content creation company for Russia-friendly content. 
After the indictments were announced, both Pool and Johnson issued statements on social media, which Rubin retweeted, saying they were victims of the alleged crimes and had done nothing wrong.


“We still do not know what is true as these are only allegations,” Pool said. “Putin is a scumbag.”
In his post, Johnson wrote that he had been asked a year ago to provide content to a “media startup.” He said his lawyers negotiated a “standard, arms length deal, which was later terminated.”
Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They are at large, and it was not immediately clear if they had lawyers.
U.S. officials have previously warned of Russia’s use of unwitting Americans to further influence operations in the 2024 election, but Wednesday’s indictment is the most detailed description of those efforts to date. 
At a forum on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to suggest jokingly that he would support Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming U.S. election. Intelligence officials have said Moscow has a preference for Trump.
Putin authorized influence operations to help Trump in the 2020 election, while his 2016 campaign benefited from hacking by Russian intelligence officers and a covert social media effort, according to U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials.
With the decline of traditional media like newspapers and limits on direct advertising on social media platforms, influencers are increasingly playing a key role in politics and shaping public opinion. Both the Republican and Democratic parties invited scores of influencers to their respective national conventions this summer. But with little to no disclosure requirements about who is funding influencers’ work, the public is largely in the dark about who is powering the messaging online. 
Though the indictment does not name the Tennessee-based company, the details match up exactly with Tenet Media, an online media company that boasts of hosting “a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.” Tenet’s website lists six influencers who provide content, including Pool, Johnson, Rubin, Lauren Southern, Tayler Hansen and Matt Christiansen.
What to know about the 2024 Election
Tenet Media’s six main influencers have more than 7 million subscribers on YouTube and more than 7 million followers on X.
Fueled by public outrage and online fandom, the influencers who make up the bench of talent at Tenet Media have amassed millions of loyal followers who agree with their staunch conservatism and brazen willingness to voice controversial opinions. Their channels also have created communities for conservative Americans who have lost trust in mainstream media sources through Trump’s 2020 loss and the COVID-19 pandemic. Several of them have faced criticism for spreading political misinformation.
The indictment shows that some of the influencers were paid handsomely for their work. One unidentified influencer’s contract included a $400,000 monthly fee, a $100,000 signing bonus and an additional performance bonus. 
Tenet Media’s shows in recent months have featured high-profile conservative guests, including Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake. The nearly 2,000 videos posted by the company have gotten more than 16 million views on YouTube alone, prosecutors said.
Pool, a journalist-turned-YouTuber who first gained public attention for livestreaming the Occupy Wall Street protests, hosted Trump on his podcast earlier this year. 
Johnson is an outspoken Trump supporter and internet personality who was fired from BuzzFeed after the company found evidence he’d plagiarized other works.
Rubin was previously part of the liberal news commentary show “The Young Turks” but has since identified as a libertarian. He boasts the largest YouTube following of Tenet’s influencer roster and hosts a show called “The Rubin Report.” 
Tenet Media President Liam Donovan is the husband of Lauren Chen, a Canadian influencer who has appeared as a guest in several Tenet Media videos. Chen is affiliated with the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA and has hosted shows for the right-wing network Blaze Media. RT’s website also lists her as a contributor of several opinion articles from 2021 and 2022.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Some vans at the back of a motorcade carrying Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz crashed on the highway while heading from the airport to a campaign stop in Milwaukee on Monday, but Walz was unhurt. 
President Joe Biden called from Air Force One and spoke to Walz a short time later, as the president was traveling to a separate campaign stop in Pittsburgh with Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris herself was campaigning in Detroit before heading to the joint event later in the day with Biden, and her campaign said that she also spoke with her running mate by phone after the crash. 
The Harris campaign said the crash involved vehicles near the rear of the motorcade. Walz, who is also the governor of Minnesota, was riding closer to the front. Images posted on social media showed large passenger vans with crumpled front and backends after the collision, which was said to have occurred on Interstate 794. 
The White House said Harris was briefed on the collision and spoke with Walz to check on him and the staff.
Upon arriving at his event, Walz spoke briefly about the crash saying “some of my staff and members of the press that were traveling up with us were involved in a traffic accident on the way here today.” 
“We’ve spoken with the staff. I’m relieved to say that with a few minor injuries, everybody’s going to be okay,” Walz said. “President Biden and Vice President Harris called to check in, and we certainly appreciate their concern, and I want to express my sincere thanks to the US Secret Service and all the local first responders for their quick reaction.”


It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the crash, which occurred shortly before 1 p.m. local time and caused some minor injuries. 
A member of the traveling pool staff, who was in a van carrying reporters, had an injured arm and was treated by medics, according to a pool report from a reporter traveling in Walz’s motorcade, who wrote that passengers were “violently thrown forward, as our van slammed into the one in front of us and was hit from behind.”
Walz and his motorcade stopped at the hospital a few hours after the crash so he could check on staff members who were involved. 
The van carrying the reporters remained pulled over on the side of the road for several minutes afterward. 
Some reporters had scrapes and bruises and one had a bloody nose. Another feared having suffered a concussion and was initially looking to be taken to urgent care — but eventually climbed aboard a new van to accompany the rest of the press to the event. 
All who wanted to be checked out by paramedics were assessed, according to the pool report.
The crash occurred after Walz and his wife, Gwen, were greeted at the airport by Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin. The trio embraced, chatted and posed for a photo before the motorcade began heading to the event. 
Monday’s campaign stops marking Labor Day were Walz’s first aboard the Harris-Walz campaign charter aircraft. It bears decals of an American flag, the words Harris-Walz, and “A New Way Forward.”",False

NEW YORK (AP) — New York City Police Commissioner Edward Caban resigned Thursday, one week after it emerged that his phone was seized as part of a federal investigation that touched several members of Mayor Eric Adams’ inner circle.
Caban, who had been in charge of the nation’s largest police department for about 15 months, said in an email to staff that he made the decision to resign after the “news around recent developments” had “created a distraction for our department.”
“I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD,” he added in the email obtained by The Associated Press.
At a news conference Thursday, Adams praised Caban for “making our city safer” and said he had named Tom Donlon, a retired FBI official, as the interim police commissioner.
Donlon previously served as the chief of the FBI’s National Threat Center and once led the Office of Homeland Security in New York, before starting his own security firm in 2020. He helped lead the investigation into the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and investigated the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings and USS Cole bombing.
Donlon said in a statement he was “honored and humbled” to head “the greatest law enforcement agency in the world,” and that his priorities would include removing illegal guns from the community.
Caban’s resignation marks the first high-level departure from the Adams administration since federal investigators seized phones Sept. 4 from several members of the mayor’s inner circle, including two deputy mayors, the schools chancellor, and one of Adams’ top advisers.


The subject of the investigation, which is being led by U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan, remains unclear, as does whether federal authorities were seeking information linked to one investigation or several.
Caban’s lawyers, Russell Capone and Rebekah Donaleski, said in a statement Thursday they had been told by the government that “he is not a target of any investigation being conducted by the Southern District of New York, and he expects to cooperate fully with the government.”
The Justice Department defines a target of an investigation as someone whom prosecutors or a grand jury have gathered substantial evidence against that links the person to a crime. That’s in contrast to a subject, which is someone whose conduct is merely within the scope of the investigation. But those definitions are notoriously fluid and a person not seen as a technical target one day can become a target the next as new information develops.
Federal authorities are also investigating Caban’s twin brother, James Caban, a former NYPD sergeant who runs a nightclub security business, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person could not publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.
James Caban “unequivocally denies any wrongdoing,” his lawyer, Sean Hecker, said in a statement. “His work – as a consultant and acting as a liaison between the Department and a private company – is perfectly legal, especially given his previous career as a NYPD officer,” Hecker continued.
James Caban was fired by the NYPD in 2001 after he was heard on a recording illegally detaining a cab driver whom he accused of stealing $100 and threatening to seize his vehicle.
According to people familiar with the matter, other officials whose devices were recently seized include First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright; Philip Banks, the deputy mayor for public safety; his brother David Banks, the schools chancellor; and Timothy Pearson, a mayoral adviser and former high-ranking NYPD official. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation.
Adams, a first-term Democrat, was subpoenaed in July, eight months after federal agents seized his cell phones and an iPad while he was leaving an event in Manhattan. Federal authorities haven’t publicly accused him or any officials of any crimes, and Adams has denied any wrongdoing.
The investigation that led to Edward Caban’s devices being seized is not believed to be tied to a probe that led federal investigators to seize Adams’ devices last November, according to two people familiar with the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
Caban, 57, was the first Latino to lead the 179-year-old NYPD. He started as a patrol officer in 1991 in the Bronx, where he grew up, and worked in precincts across the city as he was promoted. His father, retired Detective Juan Caban, had served with Adams, a former police captain, when they were both on the city’s transit police force. Three of Caban’s brothers were also police officers.
He was the department’s second-in-command before being named commissioner last year.
Caban replaced Keechant Sewell, the first woman to lead the force. She resigned 18 months into a tenure clouded by speculation that she was not truly in charge.
As commissioner, Caban presided over continuing declines in some major crime categories, including shootings and murders, but was also criticized for his handling of officer discipline, including two officers who did not face any internal disciplinary action in the fatal shooting of a Black man, Kawaski Trawick, inside his Bronx apartment in 2019.
Donlon’s appointment marks the first time in more than two decades that someone without prior experience serving in a local police department will lead the NYPD. Close observers of the agency described the move as both politically strategic and potentially risky.
“It gives the mayor some credibility at a time when his police department and administration are facing federal investigations,” said Jeffrey Fagan, a Columbia Law School professor focused on policing. “At the same time, will someone with no experience in a complex municipal police department and no real power base be able to clean up this mess?”

WINDER, Ga. (AP) — It was the middle of second period at Apalachee High School, and the boy who few knew slipped out of his algebra class in J Hall again. That didn’t strike his fellow students as unusual.

“He got up sometime in the morning, and class continued as normal,” Lyela Sayarath said. “He was probably just skipping.”

Many teenagers weren’t quite awake on Wednesday morning at the high school near Winder, in rapidly suburbanizing Barrow County. Junior Julie Sandoval was dozing in her physics class as other students caught up on work. Sophomore Jacob King also dozed off, in world history, after a morning football practice.

But soon, terror and panic erupted as authorities say Colt Gray, the 14-year-old student who left class, returned to the hallway with a semiautomatic assault-style rifle and opened fire. Four people were killed and nine more hurt, seven of them shot, in the latest school shooting to shock the nation.

Gray is charged with four counts of murder. Authorities haven’t said yet where he got the weapon, how he brought it to campus or what he did with it in the two hours between school starting at 8:15 a.m. and when shots first rang out around 10:20 a.m. 

Law enforcement hasn’t said whether Gray was being sought before the shooting. “We’re still trying to clarify a lot of the timeline,” Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said Wednesday. 



On Thursday, officials also arrested his father, Colin Gray, and charged him with involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder and cruelty to children, saying he knowingly allowed his son to possess a gun.





At the school on Wednesday morning, the alert was sounded when several teachers set off their wearable panic buttons, which Sheriff Jud Smith said were distributed to staff only days earlier. That sparked a lockdown, and immediately a warning flashed on classroom smartboards across the sprawling school.

“The screen ... said ‘hard lockdown’ in big red words, and the top light started flashing,” said Layla Ferrell, a junior who was in a food and nutrition class in another hall. 

Many thought it was a drill. Georgia schools are required to complete at least one active shooter drill by Oct. 1 each year.

“I thought it was fake until my friend told me it wasn’t fake,” King said. He added, “They weren’t really acting like it was real.”

Some heard what sounded like a loud, metallic crash.

“It sounded more like punching a locker at first,” Ferrell said.

But those in J Hall had no doubt.

Sayarath said that when the suspect tried to return to class, a student saw what warrants describe as “black semi-automatic AR-15 style rifle” and refused to let him in. Classroom doors at the school lock automatically and must be opened from inside, a “hardening” precaution in America’s era of school shootings.

Kaylee Abner, a sophomore, said a student who left her geometry class to take a test elsewhere came racing back.

“She ran back inside, shuts the door and then we hear three gunshots,” Abner said.

Junior Landon Culver got a glimpse of the shooter after leaving algebra II.

“I was walking out to get water and I heard gunshots and I heard bullets going like by my head,” Culver said. “It looked like he was wearing a black hoodie and he had a AR and, I just, I didn’t really stick around too long to look.”

Marques Coleman Jr. told The Washington Post that the shooter leaned inside an open door of his algebra classroom and sprayed it with gunfire, hitting people including Christian Angulo, who died. Others were shot in the hall.

Senior Kassidy Reed was retaking a test in a hallway when she heard shots from around the corner. A teacher told everyone to flee.

“He got us up and told us to run because our classroom door was shut and it was locked, so we couldn’t get in there,” Reed said.

A teacher across the hall opened the door to her chemistry classroom, and the students ran inside. “I hid under a lab table,” Reed said. 

Teachers turned out lights and herded students into corners or behind desks. Classroom furniture became makeshift barricades.

“We put desks and chairs against our door and built it up so that nobody could get in, and then we were all just quiet, waiting,” Ferrell said.





Authorities say the suspect fatally shot students Angulo and Mason Schermerhorn, both 14, and teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie, 53. The nine who were hurt — eight students and a teacher — are expected to recover. 

One of the three school resource officers on campus quickly tracked down the shooter, who gave up and was taken into custody, the sheriff said.

Some students said they heard shouts from an officer ordering the shooter to halt and put his gun down.

“I heard the ‘Get down! Get down! Don’t move!’ Reed said. Then, the sound of a “scuffle” as the suspect was handcuffed.

But the terror wasn’t over. 

Students said some students and teachers took off their clothes to try to stanch bleeding from gunshot wounds. 

Deputies with guns drawn searched classroom by classroom for any more wounded, as well as any other possible shooters. 

As students huddled, they called and texted each other and their parents. More than a few sent what they feared would be farewells.

“I love you. I love you so much. Ma I love you,” a crying Sandoval texted. “I’m sorry I’m not the best daughter. I love you.”

Sandoval’s mother wrote back in Spanish to say everything would be all right and she should trust in God.

“We started praying, because we didn’t know whether we would come out alive or not,” said Michelle Moncada, a freshman who was in art class.

Nearby, Sandoval said, another student was on the phone with their mother: “They’re shooting up the school! They’re shooting up the school!” 

Abner held the hand of a boy who was praying. 

“I was just trying to think happy thoughts, trying not to think anything negative,” she said.
There’s no red flag gun law in Georgia, where a deadly shooting at a high school left four people dead and nine wounded. But the 14-year-old alleged shooter would not have been able to buy an assault rifle on his own.





The hundreds of panicked parents who raced to the school created a traffic jam along the two-lane roads near Apalachee High. Many abandoned their cars and ran toward campus.

Shannon Callahan, Ferrell’s mother, said her daughter texted a photo of her barricaded under a table. “Once the texts stopped, I was 100% completely worried.”

During the evacuation, King saw the body of what appeared to a student on the floor. “They were blocking the body,” King said.

Abner also saw what appeared to be female student who had been shot, in the shoulder. She was leaning against a wall as emergency personnel attended to her. 

Another female student was lying on the floor and covering her eyes, Abner said: “I don’t know if she was dead or shot or something, or just processing.” 

Reed saw a gun on the floor, and blood.

As they fled, students abandoned bookbags, phones, even shoes. Ferrell lost her rainbow Crocs and later made the long walk to her mother’s car in her socks. 

Gathered inside the football stadium, students wept and milled around.

“Everyone is crying, everyone is walking around,” Moncada said. “They’re all running around trying to see who’s OK and who’s not.”

By early afternoon, students began to be released to parents to go home. 

But Culver and others said the sound of gunfire will stick with them forever. 

“You could hear gunshots, like just ringing out through the school,” Culver said. “And you’re just wondering, which one of those is going to be somebody that you’re best friends with or somebody that you love?”

DETROIT (AP) — Jeep and Ram maker Stellantis will spend $406 million retooling three Michigan factories so they can build electric vehicles or battery parts to support a strategy of making vehicles powered by both gasoline and batteries.
With its investment announcement Wednesday, the company is taking a step toward meeting some commitments that it agreed to in a new contract ratified last fall by the United Auto Workers union after a bitter six-week strike. It’s aimed at countering union arguments that Stellantis won’t keep commitments and doesn’t want to invest in U.S. factories.
An assembly plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, north of Detroit, will get the bulk of the investment, $235.5 million, so it can make the battery-powered Ram 1500 pickup truck that will go into production later this year. 
The plant, which has been singled out by CEO Carlos Tavares for criticism due to quality problems, also will make a full-size electric pickup with a range-extending gas-powered generator.
In the union contract, which runs through April of 2028, the company agreed to invest $1.4 billion at the Sterling Heights plant.
Stellantis also said it will sink about $97.6 million into the Warren Truck Plant, also north of Detroit, so it can build electric versions of the Jeep Wagoneer large SUV, one of four Jeep EVs scheduled to be produced globally by the end of next year.


The company promised in the union contract that Warren Truck would get roughly $600 million of investment.
An engine factory in Dundee, Michigan, southwest of Detroit, will get over $73 million so it can assemble, weld and test battery trays for future EVs, as well as make front and rear beams for large vehicles. Battery tray production will start this year, and the beams in 2026, Stellantis said in a statement.
The Dundee factory is supposed to get $770 million, according to the contract.
Union President Shawn Fain has threatened to strike the company over delays in its commitment in the contract to reopen the shuttered assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois, in 2027, and open a new battery plant there in 2028. At stake are more than 2,700 jobs.
But the company, which has reported poor sales and earnings this year, has delayed the reopening given what it calls unfavorable “market conditions.” Stellantis says it will eventually meet its commitment to reopen the plant.
Yet no date has been given for the company to restart the factory or to open a new battery plant and a new parts warehouse, both which were also promised in the contract agreement that ended the UAW’s strike against Stellantis last year. At stake are more than 2,700 jobs.
A union spokesman declined comment Wednesday on the company’s announcement. 
In the company statement, Tavares thanks workers at Sterling Heights for gearing up to build the electric Ram in record time. “With these investments supporting both Jeep and Ram, we’re adding innovations to our Michigan manufacturing footprint to support a multi-energy approach that is laser-focused on customer demand,” he said.",False

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indianapolis’ biggest offseason need was supposed to be beefing up a young secondary that struggled in 2023.
Instead, two weeks into the season, the run defense has been the most glaring problem.
The Colts’ first two opponents, Houston and Green Bay, each rushed for more than 200 yards, putting winless Indy already in a two-game deficit in the AFC South and last in the NFL with 237.0 yards rushing allowed per game entering Monday.
Clearly, the Colts need to find a quick solution with the Chicago Bears (1-1) coming to town for Week 3.
“We have to get in our meeting room on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and get it fixed. That is the bottom line,” coach Shane Steichen said after Sunday’s 16-10 loss. “We have the guys in that locker room to do it. I have no doubt about that. I am not going to lose any faith in that, we just have to get it fixed.”
It won’t be easy, especially with three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle DeForest Buckner hurting. He’s only missed one game since being acquired in 2020, being held out of a November game after going on the COVID-19 list.
Buckner’s streak could be in serious jeopardy this week. Despite playing through a back injury Sunday, he left the game and was carted to the locker room with what turned out to be a sprained ankle. He did not return.
And with last season’s sacks leader, Samson Ebukam, already out with a torn Achilles tendon that leaves two big holes on Indy’s defensive line.


Personnel may only be part of the problem.
Even with Buckner, the Colts allowed 100-yard rushers in consecutive weeks and Green Bay needed only two quarters to top 200 yards.

While the Colts’ halftime adjustments helped plug some of the holes, it’s unclear whether they will change anything over the last 15 games. 
“You give up that, two weeks in a row, you come to a reality that’s a problem,” linebacker E.J. Speed said Monday when asked about the 474 yards rushing they’ve allowed this season. “I know that I accepted it, being a linebacker and teams running the ball on us and I know this week I’ll be doing everything in my power to stop the run.”
Jonathan Taylor. On a day the Colts played so poorly in other facets, Taylor looked like the 2021 NFL rushing champ. While his league-high scoring streak ended at seven games, he accounted for nearly half of Indy’s 338 total yards with 103 rushing and 32 receiving.
Ball security. Quarterback Anthony Richardson is now 2-4 as a starter and clearly needs more time to become the franchise quarterback Indy expects. Yes, he’s showed potential. But after fumbling twice and throwing three interceptions, one coming on the final heave of the game, Richardson must take care of the ball.
Alec Pierce. The third-year receiver was one of Richardson’s favorite options for the second straight week. Pierce’s progress was under major scrutiny last season. This season he appears to have taken a big step forward. He leads the Colts with eight receptions, 181 yards and two TD catches through two games.
WR Adonai Mitchell. The speedy rookie turned heads at training camp and during the preseason, increasing expectations. But he and Richardson are not yet in sync, resulting in Mitchell catching just two of his nine targets for 32 yards. 
Buckner was carted to the locker room during the game after his lower right leg got caught underneath him. But it may not have been as serious as originally feared. Steichen said Monday that Buckner has a sprained ankle. Rookie DE Laiatu Latu also did not return after injuring his hip Sunday. Starting safety Julian Blackmon missed the Green Bay game with a shoulder injury. Starting CB JuJu Brents (knee) went on injured reserve last week.
The Colts remain hopeful WR Josh Downs could return this week from an ankle injury that has kept him out since early August.
39:49 — That’s the total possession time for Indy through two weeks. It’s also 22 seconds less than the Green Bay Packers had Sunday. Finding a way to sustain drives and give the defense a breather certainly would help.
The Colts return home for the next two games, against quarterback Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears and the Pittsburgh Steelers. If the Colts hope to turn their season around, it’s imperative they start winning now.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — John Love and Andy Borregales sent Virginia Tech and No. 7 Miami into halftime with a little bit of fireworks Friday night.
They’re the kickers — and they connected on career-longs 20 seconds apart to end the first half.
Love made a 57-yarder for Virginia Tech, and Borregales answered with a 56-yarder for Miami on the final play before halftime. The Hokies took a 24-17 lead into the locker room in the Atlantic Coast Conference opener for both teams.
Love added a 52-yarder in the second half, but Miami wound up rallying for a 38-34 victory.
It was the first FBS game since an Arizona-Washington State matchup on Oct. 28, 2017 — according to SportRadar — where both teams connected on a field goal of at least 56 yards.
There were 14 field goals of 56 yards or more at the FBS level in the entire 2023 season, the NCAA said, and Love and Borregales pushed the number of such kicks in 2024 to 10 already.

BEIJING (AP) — China is marking the 75th year of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger over the massive state.
No festivities have been announced for the 75th anniversary on Tuesday, save for a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, with an honor guard marching from the entrance of the sprawling palace that in past centuries was the home of Chinese emperors. 


The entirely state-controlled media ran constant reports on China’s economic progress and social stability, with no mention of challenges ranging from a declining birth rate to the disruption in supply chains that has harmed the largely export-driven economy. 
Commemorations were also held in the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portugal’s former territory of Macao, both of which returned to Chinese sovereignty in the late 1990s in a key indication of Beijing’s determination to overcome what it has called a “Century of Humiliation.” 
In recent decades, China has mounted military parades and displays of the country’s economic might only at the turn of decades, such as for the 60th and 70th anniversaries.
The world’s second largest economy has struggled to regain momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A prolonged property slump led to a spillover effect on other parts of the economy, from construction to sales of home appliances. Last week, China announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages.


Party leader and head of state Xi Jinping has largely avoided overseas travel since the pandemic, while continuing with his purges at home of top officials considered insufficiently loyal or being suspected of corruption or personal indiscretions.
“The road ahead will not be smooth, there will definitely be difficulties and obstacles, and we may encounter major tests such as high winds and rough seas, or even stormy waves” Xi warned during a banquet on the eve of the anniversary.
“We must be vigilant in times of peace, plan ahead, and rely closely on the entire Party, the entire army, and people of all ethnic groups across the country” he said, “no difficulties can stop the Chinese people from moving forward.”
The anniversary also comes as China is facing growing frictions with neighbors including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over territorial claims and their close relationships with Beijing’s chief rival, the United States. 
The Communists under Mao Zedong seized power in 1949 amid a civil war with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, who shifted their political, economic and military power to the now self-governing island democracy of Taiwan. 
Beijing continues to insist Taiwan must be annexed under Communist Party rule, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has provided arms to ensure its defense. 
China, meanwhile, has involved itself in disputes over its claims to most of the South China Sea and uninhabited islands held by Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighboring nations.
China’s military buildup and its recent launch of a nuclear capable ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean have raised concerns about a possible conflict. 
At home, Xi has made himself effectively leader for life by ending term limits and extending his power over key government and party bodies. China allows no competitive elections and the party retains near total control over the media that informs its 1.4 billion people. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Xi on the anniversary and the subsequent establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties, noting that Russia was the first country to recognize the People’s Republic of China 75 years ago, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
Xi reaffirmed their close ties, saying China would continue to expand “all-round pragmatic cooperation” between the two nations.",False

LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — Caleb Williams insisted he won’t be motivated by comparisons to C.J. Stroud when the Chicago Bears visit the Houston Texans on Sunday night.
The quarterback drafted with the No. 1 overall pick by the Bears simply wants to do better after a less-than-dazzling debut and help his team come away with another win. 
The 2022 Heisman Trophy winner at Southern California got bailed out by the defense and special teams as the Bears rallied to beat the Tennessee Titans 24-17 in the season opener. He could be missing two of this top wide receivers this week with Rome Odunze (sprained knee) and Keenan Allen (heel) sitting out practice on Wednesday.
“I didn’t have obviously the performance I wanted to, so trying to figure it out as fast as possible, making sure we are on the same page, making sure we are handling things that we need to handle,” Williams said Wednesday. “Like I said, all the small things become a lot larger on game day. Making sure we handle those things, myself included. Progressing from there.”
Williams wasn’t all that interested in any comparisons to Stroud and the path he followed last year in a dazzling rookie season.
The Texans’ quarterback threw for more than 4,100 yards and was AP Offensive Player of the Year after being drafted out of Ohio State with the No. 2 overall pick. He helped the Texans go from worst to first in the AFC South.


“My motivation is to be the best for the Chicago Bears, win games, get to the playoffs and you know, win games there. I’m trying to do my best, day in and day out, mentally, physically, rest and make sure I sleep well, I eat well, Make sure I’m doing all the right things throughout the week and the weeks leading up to the game to make sure that I’m there to the best of my ability for my team.”

The Bears are counting on Williams to become the sort of quarterback Chicago has craved for years. But the opener served as a reminder: He is far from a finished product.
Williams looked every bit like a rookie, completing just 14 of 29 passes for 93 yards, except he did something no quarterback drafted with the No. 1 overall pick had done in more than two decades. He won his first start. 
That hadn’t happened since David Carr led Houston past Dallas in 2002. The past 15 No. 1 picks were a combined 0-14-1 in first starts, beginning with Cincinnati’s Carson Palmer in 2003.
“You woke up and realize that you won your first game in the NFL regardless of how you felt of your performance,” Williams said. “We won our first game and felt super excited. Felt super excited about not necessarily how I actually performed, but like I said being able to come out with that win and being able to help lead these guys to that win. Feels good, really excited. It builds confidence when you can come out and do that.”
The Bears trailed Tennessee 17-0, yet managed to come away with the win even though their offense produced just 148 yards and zero touchdowns. Williams overthrew some receivers and had a few throws batted at the line. He said he rushed his drop-backs, which threw off the timing, and insisted those issues should not be too difficult to address.
“It’s not throws that I usually miss throughout all the time that I’ve been playing quarterback,” he said.

DETROIT (AP) — About 1,000 workers at a General Motors joint venture electric vehicle battery plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, will get big pay raises now that they have joined the United Auto Workers union.
GM and LG Energy Solution of Korea, which jointly run the plant, agreed to recognize the union after a majority of workers signed cards saying they wanted to join, the UAW said Wednesday.
Both sides will bargain over local contract provisions, but worker pay and other details will fall under the UAW national contract negotiated last fall, the union said in a prepared statement. Starting pay which was $20 per hour will rise to a minimum of $27.72. Over three years, minimum production worker pay will rise to $30.88, the contract says.
The joint venture, Ultium Cells LLC, said in a release that the union recognition came after an independently certified process that ended Tuesday. “We believe this will support the continuity of operations, drive innovation, and enhance world-class manufacturing,” the release said.
Representation of the battery plant gives the UAW another foothold in U.S. southern states as it tries to organize nonunion auto plants. Workers at a 4,300-employee Volkswagen assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted in April to join the union, and contract bargaining is expected to begin this month. 
But the union lost its first organizing vote in May at a Mercedes assembly plant and other facilities near Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 
Spring Hill is the second GM joint venture battery plant to join the union and fall under the national contract. Workers at a plant near Warren, Ohio, voted to join the union in 2022.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Kyle Isbel snapped Kansas City’s 27-inning scoreless streak by sprinting home on a throwing error in the 10th inning, Cole Ragans gave up three hits in six innings, and the Royals held on to the second American League wild card with a 1-0 victory over the Washington Nationals on Tuesday night.
Isbel, the Royals’ automatic runner to begin the 10th, reached third on Bobby Witt Jr.’s infield single to short and crossed the plate on Nasim Nuñez’s low throw to first to end Kansas City’s seven-game slide.
“It’s a little bit of a sigh of relief,” Ragans said. “We knew it’s going to come down to probably a game like this to get us back on track.”
Kansas City and Detroit are both 83-74 but the Royals own the head-to-head tiebreaker. Both teams are two games up on Minnesota.
After three games without a hit with a runner in scoring position, the Royals were 2 for 11 in that situation Tuesday, though neither plated a run.
“There’s definitely frustration, but I think tonight it was more like, disbelief,” said Royals manager Matt Quatraro. “We know we’re too good a team to have that continue for a long period of time.”
Kyle Finnegan (3-7) escaped the 10th without further damage, but the Nationals lost for the seventh time in eight games.
“Our defense was good until that one play,” said Nats manager Dave Martinez. “It really came down to one play, and execution, and not being able to hit the ball.”


Lucas Erceg worked a clean 10th for his 12th save and ninth with the Royals, striking out Joey Gallo for the final out after the Nationals slugger hooked a 3-2 offering just to the foul side of the right-field foul pole.
“You can never count your chickens there that you’re going to strand the runner,” Quatraro said of Erceg, whom Kansas City acquired in a trade from Oakland at this year’s deadline. “But you certainly like your chances.”
Ragans struck out six in his fourth consecutive outing of six innings or more to lower his September ERA to 1.08.
Kris Bubic stranded a runner on third in the seventh, Sam Long pitched a scoreless eighth and Angel Zerpa (2-0) threw a perfect ninth to get the game to extra innings.
Royals: RHP Hunter Harvey (back) will be shut down for the season. The reliever hasn’t appeared since Aug. 4, and will get another medical opinion. “He’s going to go see someone in Dallas to see if they can find something different, but by all accounts, we think it’s just going to be rest” that he needs, said Quatraro. ... RHP James McArthur (right elbow), who last pitched on Sept. 16, also won’t return this season. ... RHP Michael Lorenzen (left hamstring) remains on track to return from the injured list to make Wednesday’s start, Quatraro said.
Nationals: Recalled OF Stone Garrett from Triple-A Rochester and placed INF Andrés Chaparro on the paternity list.
Lorenzen (7-6, 3.43 ERA) will try to continue his excellent form since joining the Royals from Texas at the deadline. He has a 1.85 ERA and 2-0 record in five starts with Kansas City. He’ll face rookie lefty DJ Herz (4-8, 4.30).

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government has seized a luxury jet used by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that officials say was illegally purchased through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States in violation of sanctions and export control laws. 
The Dassault Falcon 900EX was seized in the Dominican Republic and transferred to the custody of federal officials in Florida, the Justice Department said Monday. The plane landed at Ft. Lauderdale Executive Airport shortly before noon Monday, according to flight tracking websites.
U.S. officials say associates of the Venezuelan leader in late 2022 and early 2023 used a Caribbean-based shell company to hide their involvement in the purchase of the plane, valued at the time at $13 million, from a company in Florida. The plane was then exported from the U.S. to Venezuela, through the Caribbean, in April 2023 in a transaction meant to circumvent an executive order that bars U.S. persons from business transactions with representatives of Maduro’s government.
The plane, registered to San Marino, was widely used by Maduro for foreign travel, including in trips earlier this year to Guyana and Cuba. It was also involved in a December swap on a Caribbean airstrip of several Americans jailed in Venezuela for a close Maduro ally, Alex Saab, imprisoned in the U.S. on money laundering charges. 
Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement the aircraft had been smuggled out of the U.S. for use by “Maduro and his cronies.”


Venezuela’s government acknowledged the seizure in a statement Monday. It characterized the U.S. government’s move as “a repeated criminal practice that cannot be described as anything other than piracy.”
State media footage from a December visit to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shows Maduro, First Lady Cilia Flores and senior officials getting off the airplane ahead of a day of discussions over a territory dispute between Venezuela and neighboring Guyana.
“Let this seizure send a clear message: aircraft illegally acquired from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned Venezuelan officials cannot just fly off into the sunset,” Matthew Axelrod, an assistant secretary for export enforcement in the Commerce Department, said in a statement.
CNN first reported the plane seizure.
The seizure announcement comes just over a month after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the victor in presidential elections without showing any detailed results to back up their claim. The lack of transparency has drawn international condemnation. Meanwhile, the opposition managed to obtain more than 80% of vote tally sheets showing Maduro lost by a wide margin against former diplomat Edmundo González.
Late Monday, a Venezuelan judge issued an arrest warrant for González as part of a criminal investigation into the results of the disputed July election. The warrant was issued at the request of authorities who accuse González of various crimes including conspiracy, falsifying documents and usurpation of powers.
The plane was previously registered in the U.S. and owned by Lorida, Florida-based Six G Aviation, a broker that buys and sells used aircraft. FAA records indicate it was exported to St. Vincent and the Grenadines and de-registered in the U.S. in January 2023.
Gary Gwynn, owner of Six G, declined to comment. “I’ve been instructed by the FBI not to speak to anyone,” he said when contacted by The Associated Press.
In March, it flew to the Dominican Republic, along with a Venezuelan-registered plane, for what was believed to be maintenance, never to leave again.
Monday’s action follows the U.S. government’s earlier seizure in Argentina of a Boeing 747-300 cargo plane transferred from Iran to a subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned airlines.
Federal prosecutors have also have seized several private jets belonging to top government officials and insiders who have been either sanctioned or indicted in the U.S.
The U.S. has sanctioned 55 Venezuelan-registered planes, mostly belonging to state-owned oil giant PDVSA. It has also offered a $15 million bounty for the arrest of Maduro to face federal drug trafficking charges in New York.
“There is an overarching body of work and continued body of work, looking at the corrupt practices of the Venezuelan government,” Anthony Salisbury, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Miami, told the AP. “Obviously, we are not done yet.”

CHICAGO (AP) — Jameson Taillon pitched seven crisp innings in his second straight win, and the Chicago Cubs beat the Cincinnati Reds 1-0 on Friday in the opener of their season-ending series.
Taillon (12-8) allowed four hits, struck out two and walked two on a blustery, overcast afternoon at Wrigley Field. The right-hander went 4-0 with a 1.63 ERA in the last six starts of his second year with the Cubs.
“I had a little bit of a rough patch there in like early, mid-August,” Taillon said. “To be able to bounce back from that and finish strong is a good feeling.”
Tyson Miller got three outs before Porter Hodge finished the four-hitter for his eighth save.
At 1 hour, 48 minutes, it was the majors’ fastest nine-inning game since Armando Galarraga nearly threw a perfect game for Detroit against Cleveland on June 2, 2010. That game was completed in 1 hour, 44 minutes.
It was the fastest nine-inning game for the Cubs since they finished a 3-0 victory over the Reds in 1 hour, 48 minutes on May 24, 2001, at Wrigley, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
“That was quick, yeah. That was nice,” a smiling Taillon said after his 200th career start. “Hit it into the wind. Good luck.”
Chicago (82-78) clinched a winning season and improved to 4-7 against Cincinnati this year. The Cubs began the season with playoff aspirations under new manager Craig Counsell, but they were derailed by injuries and an inconsistent lineup.


Cincinnati (76-84) wasted another stellar performance by Nick Martinez (10-7), who pitched a five-hitter for his first career complete game. The right-hander went 4-1 with a 0.83 ERA in five September starts.
“Didn’t have a great feel for my changeup today,” Martinez said. “So knowing what the wind is doing, kind of play to the elements and at times try to see how far they can hit it, knowing that it’s going to be a benefit for me.”
The Reds lost for the sixth time in eight games. They failed to advance a runner to third.
“With the wind blowing in as hard as it was, it was a challenge,” Cincinnati interim manager Freddie Benavides said.
The Cubs got their only run in the fifth. Nico Hoerner hit a leadoff double, advanced to third on Pete Crow-Armstrong’s sacrifice bunt and scampered home on Miguel Amaya’s sacrifice fly.
Reds catcher Tyler Stephenson grabbed Jake Fraley’s throw from right field and made a sweeping tag attempt, but Hoerner slid in safely.
Counsell applauded third base coach Willie Harris’ decision to send Hoerner on the tricky flyball.
“I think when that ball went up in the air, Willie was yelling at Nico, which was really cool, like, ‘You’re going. I don’t care where the ball ends up,’” Counsell said.
Cincinnati had multiple baserunners in just one inning. TJ Friedl and Ty France walked with one out in the second, but Fraley and Santiago Espinal flied out.
Reds: C Tyler Stephenson was checked on by a trainer after he was clipped by a foul ball in the fifth. But he stayed in the game.
Cubs: OF Seiya Suzuki (ankle) missed his second straight game. Counsell said Suzuki hit in the cage and did some running. “Optimistic he can play tomorrow,” Counsell said.
Right-handers Rhett Lowder (2-2, 1.40 ERA) and Kyle Hendricks (4-12, 6.28 ERA) take the mound on Saturday. Lowder pitched five scoreless innings in Cincinnati’s 7-1 victory over Pittsburgh last weekend. Hendricks, who is eligible for free agency after this season, is making what could be his last start for Chicago.

DETROIT (AP) — The Chicago White Sox lost their post-1900s, major league-record 121st game Friday night, falling 4-1 to the Detroit Tigers.
The White Sox broke the mark of 120 set by the New York Mets in 1962 in their first season. The Cleveland Spiders hold the overall record, going 20-134 in 1899.
“Honestly, there’s nothing for me right now,” manager Grady Sizemore said. “I think the frustration came long before this number. This was one of those things you can’t be happy about, but I don’t know if I would feel any different if we were at 115 or 110.”
The closest any team had come to New York’s record was the 2003 Tigers, who won their final two games to finish with 119 losses. That remained the American League record until the White Sox hit 120 on Sunday in San Diego.
After avoiding the record by sweeping the Los Angeles Angels at home, the White Sox lost to a Tigers team that wrapped up a postseason spot in front of 44,435 raucous fans.
The White Sox were the ones going to the postseason as recently as 2021.
“It’s tough watching them celebrate, because that was us just a couple years ago,” starting pitcher Garrett Crochet said.
Crochet gave them a chance, finishing his season with four shutout innings, but the White Sox couldn’t score early and Jared Shuster gave up two runs in the fifth.
Zach DeLoach hit his first homer in the sixth, but Dominic Fletcher’s error in center field led to two more Tigers runs in the seventh.


Chicago went out quietly against the red-hot Tigers bullpen.
“No one in our clubhouse is feeling sorry for themselves,” Sizemore said. “There’s a lot left in the tank, but (the Tigers) have shown a lot in these last couple months. They are just getting better.”
The White Sox, who are last in the American League in runs scored and runs allowed, have threatened the 120-loss barrier since starting the season with 25 losses in their first 28 games.
“We put ourselves in this position early on,” Crochet said. “We had a bad April and we never dug ourselves out of that hole.”
Chicago was 15-48 after losing 14-2 to the Red Sox on June 6 — the Mets were 17-46 after 63 games — but won the next two games to start an 11-16 run. That left them at 26-64, two games better than New York’s record after 90 games.
At that point, it looked as if they could avoid matching the Tigers and Mets, but they lost 23 of their next 24 games, including a 20-game losing streak. 
By the time they beat the Athletics 5-1 on Aug. 6, they were on pace for 124 losses. 
Another 10-game losing streak, stretching from August into September left them at 31-109 (.221). At that point, the question seemed to be whether they could keep the total losses from approaching 125.
That didn’t look likely when they fell to 33-115 after a 2-0 home loss to the A’s on Sept. 13. To avoid breaking the record, they needed seven wins in their final 12 games.
They came closer than anyone could have expected. They won the last two games against Oakland and the first game of a road series against the Angels.
A five-game losing streak followed and they matched the record against the Padres, but they returned home to outscore the Angels 14-5 in a three-game sweep. They finished 23-58 at home to avoid another record - the 59 home losses by the 1939 St. Louis Browns and the 2019 Tigers.
“We’re trying to end on a positive anyway we can,” Sizemore said.
Three years after the 2006 Tigers lost 119 games, they went to the World Series on Magglio Ordonez’s ALCS walk-off homer against the Athletics.
“Anything can happen in this game, and that’s a good example,” Sizemore said. “There’s a lot of work for us to do, and right now, we’re focused on getting ourselves better.”

NEW YORK (AP) — First baseman Ryan Mountcastle was activated by the Baltimore Orioles from the 10-day injured list on Tuesday after missing a month because of a sprained left wrist.
Baltimore also released reliever Craig Kimbrel before a series opener at the New York Yankees and optioned outfielder Eloy Jiménez to Triple-A Norfolk.
Mountcastle hurt his wrist diving into second base during a game against Houston on Aug. 22. He is hitting .267 with 13 homers and 61 RBIs.
“Adds another really good right-handed hitter for us,” manager Brandon Hyde said.
Mountcastle singled as a pinch hitter in the sixth inning and went to first base in the bottom half. 
Kimbrel had been designated for assignment on Sept. 18. A nine-time All-Star, the 36-year-old right-hander has 440 saves, fifth on the career list. He had a 5.33 ERA and 23 saves in 29 chances with the Orioles after agreeing to a $13 million, one-year contract.
Jiménez, who turns 28 in November, was acquired from the Chicago White Sox at the July 30 trade deadline for minor league left-hander Trey McGough. Jiménez hit .232 with one homer and seven RBIs in 33 games for the Orioles, leaving his season average at .238 with six homes and 23 RBIs. He is in the final guaranteed season of a $43 million, six-year contract.
Because he has more than five years of major league service, Jiménez could not have been optioned without his consent.


In the last 10 days, the Orioles have regained right-handed relief pitcher Jacob Webb (Sept. 15), outfielder Heston Kjerstad (Sept. 15), left-handed relief pitcher Danny Coulombe (Sept. 20), infielder Jordan Westburg (Sunday) and third baseman Ramón Urías (Sunday).
Right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, sidelined since July 31 by a right lat injury, is still not facing hitters and did not make the trip.

Publication date:2024-09-28 05:00:00

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Rhys Hoskins hit a grand slam off Sean Manaea in the first inning and the New York Mets’ playoff hopes took a hit Friday night with an 8-4 loss to the NL Central champion Milwaukee Brewers.
The Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks and Atlanta Braves are chasing the final two National League wild cards. The Mets and Braves have identical 87-71 records after Atlanta beat the Kansas City Royals 3-0 on Friday. The Diamondbacks fell to 88-72 after losing 5-3 to the San Diego Padres later Friday night.
“They kept fighting,” said Mets manager Carlos Mendoza, who was ejected by plate umpire Ramon De Jesus after arguing a called third strike on Francisco Alvarez in the fourth inning. “We got down early, and we didn’t give up. Turn the page, and we’ve got to get ready for tomorrow.”
New York’s loss spoiled the return of star shortstop Francisco Lindor, who went 2 for 4 with a walk and committed an error in his first appearance since Sept. 15. Lindor had played only one inning over the Mets’ past 10 games due to lower back pain.
While the Mets are still competing for a postseason berth, the Brewers already are locked into the No. 3 seed in the NL playoffs and will open a Wild Card Series Tuesday in Milwaukee.
“We know what’s at stake this weekend for those guys,” said Hoskins, a Mets nemesis dating to his days with rival Philadelphia. “Obviously, we’re trying to do what we can to be as prepared as we can for Tuesday by playing good baseball, so to get off on the right foot in the first game of a series is huge for us.”


Hoskins’ first-inning drive was his third grand slam and Milwaukee’s 10th of the season, both tying franchise records.
The only other Brewers to have three grand slams in a season were John Jaha in 1995, Devon White in 2001 and John Vander Wal in 2003. The only other year the Brewers hit 10 grand slams was 1995.
Brice Turang went 3 for 4 with three runs and three of Milwaukee’s six steals — increasing his season total to 50. Gary Sánchez homered late. 
The only other players in franchise history to have at least 50 steals in a season were Tommy Harper (73 in 1969), Scott Podsednik (70 in 2005), Jonathan Villar (62 in 2016) and Pat Listach (54 in 1992). Harper’s 73 steals came in the franchise’s inaugural season, when they were the Seattle Pilots.
“I’m not really chasing numbers — just chasing opportunities to put myself in a better situation to score a run,” Turang said.
Milwaukee improved to 11-1 in its last 12 games against the Mets, including a 4-0 record this year.
Hoskins’ slam gave the Brewers an early 4-0 lead over Manaea, who had allowed more than three runs in only one of his last 12 starts. Manaea (12-6) gave up six runs — five earned — while lasting just 3 2/3 innings. New York had won his previous eight outings.
“We’re fighting for our lives over here, and to do that doesn’t feel good,” Manaea said. “But this team’s resilient.”
The Mets trailed 5-0 before Mark Vientos hit a two-run homer off starter Frankie Montas in the third.
New York then had runners on first and second with two outs in the fourth when Alvarez worked a 10-pitch at-bat before he struck out looking at a 3-2 pitch that appeared a bit low.
The Mets scored two runs off Hoby Milner in the eighth to cut Milwaukee’s lead to 7-4, but a brilliant catch by rookie Jackson Chourio in deep left-center helped limit the damage. Sánchez provided more breathing room with a 425-foot shot to left off Alex Young in the bottom half.
Joe Ross (3-6) pitched three innings of shutout relief to earn the win. Trevor Megill got the final out in the eighth and worked a scoreless ninth to earn his 21st save in 24 opportunities.
Brewers RF Sal Frelick left after crashing into the sidewall while trying to make a leaping catch of a foul ball in the third inning. Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said Frelick will undergo an MRI on Saturday.
Alvarez exited with back spasms after sliding into third in the seventh.
Mets LHP Jose Quintana (10-9, 3.74 ERA) will start Saturday night in the middle game of the series. Milwaukee RHP Tobias Myers (8-6. 3.09) will pitch, though he won’t necessarily start.
Quintana has thrown a career-high 22 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings and allowed one earned run over 32 innings in his last five outings, winning the past four. He hasn’t pitched since Sept. 18.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The mailing of about 2,200 duplicate absentee ballots in Wisconsin’s heavily Democratic capital city of Madison has led a Republican member of Congress to falsely suggest that the clerk was lying about the presence of barcodes on the ballots themselves.
Ballots in Wisconsin do not contain barcodes. Envelopes that absentee ballots are returned in do contain barcodes so the voter can track their ballot to ensure it was received. The barcodes also allow election officials to ensure that the same voter does not cast a ballot in-person on Election Day.
An initial statement on Monday from Madison Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl did not specify that it was the envelopes, not the ballots, that contain the barcodes. The statement posted on the clerk’s website was later updated to specify that the barcodes were on the envelopes, not the ballots.
Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany, a strong supporter of Donald Trump whose northern Wisconsin district does not include Madison, posted a picture of an absentee ballot on the social platform X to show there was no barcode.
“My office has proof that there is no barcode on the actual ballots,” Tiffany posted on Wednesday. “Here is a picture of the absentee ballots – NO BARCODE.”
He also called for an investigation.
By Thursday morning his post had more than 1.6 million views.
Tiffany later took credit for the clerk changing the wording on her initial statement.


“Why do they keep editing their statements and press releases?” Tiffany posted.
Madison city spokesperson Dylan Brogan said Thursday that he altered the wording of the statement for clarity before Tiffany questioned it by “parsing apart sentences.”
“The City routinely updates its website to provide as much clarity as possible,” Brogan said.
He called the mailing of duplicate absentee ballots “a simple mistake that we immediately rectified and it will have no impact on the election.”
“There are safeguards in place,” Brogan said. “The system worked.”
Ann Jacobs, the Democratic chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, rebuked Tiffany on X.
“I can’t tell if this is just profound lack of knowledge or the intentional farming of outrage,” she posted. “Both, by the way, are bad.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore also responded to Tiffany’s post by telling him to “knock it off.”
“This is misinformation,” she posted on X. “You and I both have voted with absentee ballots in Wisconsin. You just did in the Aug 13 primary, and in 4 of the last 5 elections. We owe it to the people of Wisconsin to not spread falsehoods about election security.”
The clerk said in her response to Tiffany that 2,215 duplicate ballots were sent before the error was caught on Monday. No duplicate ballots have been returned, Witzel-Behl said. Once a ballot is received and the envelope barcode is scanned, if a second ballot is returned it will not be counted, she said.
“I would simply note that elections are conducted by humans and occasionally human error occurs,” she wrote to Tiffany. “When errors occur, we own up to them, correct them as soon as possible, and are transparent about them – precisely as we have done here.”
The dustup in battleground Wisconsin comes as there is intense scrutiny over how elections are run, particularly in swing states that are likely to decide the winner of the presidential election. Trump lost Wisconsin in 2020. Nearly four years later, conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election and false claims of widespread fraud persist. Trump continues to insist, despite no evidence of widespread fraud, that he won that election as he seeks a return to the White House.
President Joe Biden’s win over Trump in Wisconsin survived two recounts ordered by Trump, including one involving the city of Madison, an independent audit, a review by a Republican law firm and numerous lawsuits.",False

HOUSTON (AP) — Jason Heyward hit a go-ahead, two-run homer and made a dazzling defensive play as the Houston Astros beat the Seattle Mariners 4-3 on Tuesday night to clinch their fourth consecutive AL West championship.
Alex Bregman and Kyle Tucker each added a solo home run for the Astros, who are headed to the postseason for the eighth year in a row.
The Astros trailed by one with no outs in the fifth inning when Victor Caratini singled before moving to second on a sacrifice bunt by Jeremy Peña.
Heyward, who wowed on defense in the top of the inning, launched his home run to the second deck in right field off Logan Gilbert (8-12) to put Houston on top 4-3.
Heyward, who signed with the Astros last month after his release by the Dodgers, is filling in for Yordan Alvarez, who is out with a knee sprain.
“What an opportunity,” Heyward said. “You never know where you’re going to be. It’s a different journey than most to get here, but it’s really cool that the game allows that to happen. And to come into a winning clubhouse, with a winning culture, that says a lot about what people think of me and it’s fun to give that back to them.”
The Mariners had runners on first and third with one out in the eighth before Ryan Pressly retired Mitch Garver on a flyball. Josh Hader took over and struck out J.P. Crawford to preserve the lead.
Hader returned for the ninth and retired pinch-hitter Luis Urías before striking out Victor Robles and Julio Rodríguez to earn his 34th save. 


First-year Astros manager Joe Espada was overwhelmed as the final out was recorded.
“Oh my God. Unbelievable,” he said. “Tears came out of my eyes. I’m emotional because I care about this team. I love this team, and the fact that we are in a position to compete for another World Series is special.”
Framber Valdez (15-7) permitted eight hits and three runs in 5 2/3 innings for the win.
Jorge Polanco homered among his season-high four hits and had two RBIs for the Mariners, who dropped 2 1/2 games below the postseason cutoff in a crowded race for the final two American League wild cards.
“It’s always hard when you watch a team celebrate,” Seattle manager Dan Wilson said. “But I think the message here is that there’s a lot of different scenarios that could still take place. And we keep fighting ... and turn around and see what happens.” 
Justin Turner and Polanco singled to open the sixth, but Garver grounded out before Valdez struck out Crawford to end his outing.
Bryan Abreu came in and pinch-hitter Luke Raley grounded out as Houston escaped the jam.
Gilbert allowed five hits, four runs and tied a season high by giving up three homers in six innings.
There were two outs in the first when Bregman sent a fastball from Gilbert over the fence in center field to make it 1-0.
Polanco tied it when homered to left on Valdez’s second pitch of the second inning.
Rodríguez and Cal Raleigh singled to open the third before the Mariners took a 2-1 lead on an RBI double by Randy Arozarena. There was one out when Polanco singled to score Rodríguez and make it 3-1.
Tucker’s shot to start the Houston fourth sailed over the short wall in right field to cut the lead to 3-2.
Heyward robbed Raleigh of extra bases with a leaping catch in left field for the second out of the fifth. Heyward crashed into the metal scoreboard on the wall after making the play, knocking out a panel with his left hand.
He was shaken up by the collision and fell to the ground writhing in pain. Heyward was checked by an athletic trainer but remained in the game before hitting his homer in the bottom half.
Astros: Alvarez was feeling better after spraining his right knee Sunday on a slide, but wasn’t sure when he’ll return. “I really can’t do much right now,” he said. “Inflammation obviously is still there and I can’t even turn my knee right now.”
The Mariners hadn’t announced their starter for Wednesday’s series finale. LHP Yusei Kikuchi (9-9, 4.19 ERA) will pitch for Houston.

Publication date:2024-09-12 07:00:00

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A tech billionaire popped out from a SpaceX capsule hundreds of miles above Earth and performed the first private spacewalk Thursday, a high-risk endeavor once reserved for professional astronauts.
Tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman teamed up with SpaceX to test the company’s brand new spacesuits on his chartered flight. The daring feat also saw SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis going out once Isaacman was safely back inside.
This spacewalk was simple and quick — the hatch was open barely a half hour — compared with the drawn-out affairs conducted by NASA. Astronauts at the International Space Station often need to move across the sprawling complex for repairs, always traveling in pairs and lugging gear. Station spacewalks can last seven to eight hours; this one clocked in at less than two hours.
Isaacman emerged first, joining a small elite group of spacewalkers who until now had included only professional astronauts from a dozen countries. 
“Back at home, we all have a lot of work to do. But from here, it sure looks like a perfect world,” Isaacman said as the capsule soared above the South Pacific. Cameras on board caught his silhouette, waist high at the hatch, with the blue Earth beneath.
The commercial spacewalk was the main focus of the five-day flight financed by Isaacman and Elon Musk’s company, and the culmination of years of development geared toward settling Mars and other planets.


All four on board donned the new spacewalking suits to protect themselves from the harsh vacuum. They launched on Tuesday from Florida, rocketing farther from Earth than anyone since NASA’s moonwalkers. The orbit was reduced by half — to 460 miles (740 kilometers) — for the spacewalk.
This first spacewalking test involved more stretching than walking. Isaacman kept a hand or foot attached to the capsule the whole time as he flexed his arms and legs to see how the spacesuit held up. The hatch sported a walker-like structure for extra support.
After roughly 10 minutes outside, Isaacman was replaced by Gillis to go through the same motions. The SpaceX engineer bobbed up and down in weightlessness, no higher than her knees out of the capsule, as she twisted her arms and sent reports back to Mission Control.
Each had 12-foot (3.6-meter) tethers but did not unfurl them or dangle at the end unlike what happens at the space station, where astronauts routinely float out at a much lower orbit.
More and more wealthy passengers are plunking down huge sums for rides aboard private rockets to experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Others have spent tens of millions to stay in space for days or even weeks. Space experts and risk analysts say it’s inevitable that some will seek the thrill of spacewalking, deemed one of the most dangerous parts of spaceflight after launch and reentry but also the most soul-stirring. 
This operation was planned down to the minute with little room for error. Trying out new spacesuits from a spacecraft new to spacewalking added to the risk. So did the fact that the entire capsule was exposed to the vacuum of space.
There were a few glitches. Isaacman had to manually pull the hatch open instead of pushing a button on board. Before heading out, Gillis reported seeing bulges in the hatch seal. 
Scott “Kidd” Poteet, a former Air Force Thunderbird pilot, and SpaceX engineer Anna Menon stayed strapped to their seats to monitor from inside. All four underwent intensive training before the trip. 
It went by “in the blink of an eye,” said SpaceX commentator Kate Tice. 
Congratulations streamed in after the spacewalk concluded at one hour and 46 minutes — or a full swing and then some around Earth.
“Today’s success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said via X.
Isaacman, 41, CEO and founder of the Shift4 credit card-processing company, has declined to disclose how much he invested in the flight. It was the first of three flights in a program he’s dubbed Polaris; this one was called Polaris Dawn. For SpaceX’s inaugural private flight in 2021, he took up contest winners and a cancer survivor. 
Until Thursday, only 263 people had conducted a spacewalk, representing 12 countries. The Soviet Union’s Alexei Leonov kicked it off in 1965, followed a few months later by NASA’s Ed White.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Several top staffers in North Carolina Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson’s campaign for governor have quit their posts, marking more fallout from a CNN report outlining evidence that he made disturbing posts on a pornography website’s message board more than a decade ago. 
The campaign said in a news release Sunday that senior adviser Conrad Pogorzelski III, campaign manager Chris Rodriguez, the campaign’s finance director and the deputy campaign manager “have stepped down from their roles with the campaign.” Information on new campaign staffers would be forthcoming soon, the release said. 
“I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign, and I wish them well in their future endeavors,” Robinson said in the release. 
Pogorzelski, who helped Robinson get elected lieutenant governor in 2020 in his first bid for public office and later became his chief of staff, said separately on Sunday that additional staffers also left the campaign — the deputy finance director, two political directors and the director of operations.
Pogorzelski, in a text, said that he “along with others from the campaign have left of our own accord.”
The CNN report on Thursday unearthed past posts it said Robinson left on a porn site’s message boards in which he referred to himself as a “black NAZI;"" said he enjoyed transgender pornography; said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama; and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as “worse than a maggot.” 


Robinson denied writing the posts and said Thursday that he wouldn’t be forced out of the race by “salacious tabloid lies.” He avoided directly discussing the controversy during a gubernatorial campaign event on Saturday evening at a race track in Fayetteville. The event happened after earlier in the day former President Donald Trump didn’t mention Robinson at a rally about 90 miles (145 kilometers) away in Wilmington. 
Before Saturday, Robinson had been a frequent presence at Trump’s North Carolina campaign stops. The Republican presidential nominee has long praised Robinson — who would be North Carolina’s first Black governor if elected — calling him “Martin Luther King on steroids” for his speaking style.
On Sunday, Robinson still expressed optimism that he could win in November over Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the sitting attorney general. Polls have shown Robinson trailing Stein. 
But Robinson said polls have “underestimated Republican support in North Carolina for several cycles,” and with a large portion of the electorate undecided “I am confident our campaign remains in a strong position to make our case to the voters and win on November 5.”
Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion “weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down” and comparing abortion to slavery.
Stein said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Robinson is “utterly unqualified, unfit to be the governor of North Carolina, and we’re going to do everything in our power to keep that from happening.”
Polls show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris locked in a close race in North Carolina and nationally. Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump’s ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together and a new ad from Harris’ campaign highlighting the Republican candidates’ ties, as well as Robinson’s support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions.
What to know about the 2024 Election
On Sunday, Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Robinson deserves a chance to defend himself against the allegations, which Graham described as “unnerving.” He said Robinson is “a political zombie if he does not offer a defense to this that’s credible,” while arguing the issue wouldn’t hurt Trump.
“If they’re true, he’s unfit to serve for office,” Graham said of Robinson and the claims in the CNN report. “If they’re not true, he has the best lawsuit in the history of the country for libel.”

New York City officials assured residents that water flowing from their faucets will continue to be perfectly safe — even if it might taste a bit different — as they announced plans Monday to address massive leaks in the supply system by shutting down part of a main aqueduct for the winter.
The temporary shutdown this week of a stretch of the Delaware Aqueduct in upstate New York, which carries water from the Catskill region, means the city will be more reliant on reservoirs in the northern suburbs. And that could mean people with more sensitive palates could notice changes in the famously crisp taste of New York City water.
“New Yorkers should know that your water is going to taste a little, slightly different. Some of you are not going to pick it up,” Mayor Eric Adams said before sipping a bit of water at a news conference announcing the work. 
Adams called it “perfectly safe, good water.”
A section of the Delaware Aqueduct is being drained as part of a $2 billion project to address profuse leaks beneath the Hudson River. The temporary cutoff has been in the works for years, with officials steadily boosting capacity from other parts of the city’s sprawling 19-reservoir system.
The aqueduct is the longest tunnel in the world and carries water for 85 miles (137 kilometers) from four reservoirs in the Catskill region to other reservoirs in the northern suburbs. Operating since 1944, it provides roughly half the 1.1 billion gallons (4.2 billion liters) a day used by more than 8 million New York City residents. The system also serves some upstate municipalities.


But the aqueduct leaks up to 35 million gallons (132 million liters) of water a day, nearly all of it from a section far below the Hudson.
The profuse leakage has been known about for decades, but city officials faced a quandary: They could not take the critical aqueduct offline for years to repair the tunnel. So instead, they began constructing a parallel 2.5-mile (4-kilometer) bypass tunnel under the river about a decade ago.
“It’s taken us 20 years to plan for this project because the scale of this project is so massive,” said environmental Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala.
The new tunnel will be connected during the shutdown, which is expected to last up to eight months. More than 40 miles (64 kilometers) of the aqueduct running down from the four upstate reservoirs will be out of service during that time, though a section closer to the city will remain in use. 
Other leaks farther north in the aqueduct also will be repaired in the coming months. 
Deputy Commissioner Paul Rush said the work was timed to avoid summer months, when demand is higher. The city also has spent years making improvements to other parts of the system, some of which are more than 100 years old.
Capacity has been increased for the complementary Catskill Aqueduct, and more drinking water will come from the dozen reservoirs and three lakes of the Croton Watershed in the northern suburbs. The heavier reliance on those suburban reservoirs could affect the taste of water due to a higher presence of minerals and algae in the Croton system, according to city officials.
“Just as different brands of bottled water taste a bit different, so do our different reservoirs,” Aggarwala said.
City water, he said, remains a safe and healthy choice.
“I don’t know that that many people will actually notice a difference in taste. It is just possible,” he said. “And so we want to make clear to you all why and what’s going on, in case people do have concern.”",False

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday in a rare occurrence, adding to tensions in the region where multiple countries have overlapping territorial claims and both Beijing and Washington seek to project their influence.
The launch was part of routine training by the People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force, which is in charge of conventional and nuclear missile operations, and was not aimed at any country or target, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.
The ICBM, carrying a dummy warhead, landed in a designated area in the sea, the ministry said, without specifying where exactly. 
China rarely tests ICBMs out in international waters, with some experts tracing the last such deployment back to May 1980, when Beijing launched a DF-5 missile into the South Pacific. Usually, the PLA test-fires ballistic missiles in China’s remote Xinjiang region or in the Bohai Sea.
China choosing the Pacific Ocean as the location for test-firing its missile comes across as both a display of its increased nuclear capabilities and as a warning to the United States and its allies in the region, experts say.
“There is no other potential audience, as China does not expect to have to confront the EU or the U.K. militarily,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.
The test also comes weeks ahead of an expected call between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden. It marks an increase in regional security tensions with U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines, and a continuation of frictions with the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.


Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it was monitoring the missile launch, along with other military exercises by China in the region.
The launch, coinciding with the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, “is a pretty blunt signal” to the international order, said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former U.S. defense official.
“China is signaling that its forbearance has limits, that it is prepared to use its most powerful weapons to deter adversaries or punish them if needed, if deterrence fails,” he said.
Wednesday’s launch also follows a series of corruption arrests this year that ensnared several leading officers in its rocket corps on allegations of misconduct. Its aim could be to both provide assurances at home and signal to the world that the issues have been resolved. 
China boasts the world’s largest standing army and the biggest navy. Its military budget is the second highest in the world, after that of the U.S.
According to the U.S., China also has the largest air force in the Indo-Pacific, with more than half of its fighter planes consisting of fourth or fifth generation models. China also boasts a massive stockpile of missiles, along with stealth aircraft, bombers capable of delivering nuclear weapons, advanced surface ships and nuclear-powered submarines.
In his more than a decade in power, Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, has spearheaded the armed forces’ modernization, with investments in high-tech military technologies from stealth fighters to aircraft carriers and a growing arsenal of nuclear weapons.
China’s defense budget has more than doubled since 2015, even as the country’s economic growth rate has slowed considerably. A U.S. Department of Defense report last year said China has continued to strengthen the PLA’s ability to “fight and win wars against a strong enemy.”
The U.S. report also estimated China had more than 500 operational nuclear warheads as of May 2023 and was on track to accumulate more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030.
China has not revealed the size of its nuclear arsenal.
In comparison, Russia is believed to have a total inventory of more than 5,580 warheads — including 4,380 stockpiled warheads for operational forces, as well as an additional 1,200 retired warheads awaiting dismantlement — according to a report this year by the Federation of American Scientists.
The same report put the U.S. nuclear warheads at 5,044.
Few countries have ICBMs in their arsenal, and testing is usually restricted to their own territory. North Korea has carried out multiple ICBM tests since 2017, including firing a developmental solid-fueled missile in December that came down in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
The U.S. earlier this year fired two unarmed ICBMs equipped with reentry vehicles from California and brought them down on an American test site in the Marshall Islands.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers, who ran for two touchdowns, left with an ankle injury right before halftime and was limited to one second-half series against in a loss to No. 16 LSU on Saturday. 
Sellers was sacked by Bradyn Swinson on the next-to-last play of the half and limped into the locker room. Backup and former Auburn starting quarterback Robby Ashford took over for the final play. 
Ashford remained in the game for South Carolina’s first series of the second half. 
Sellers returned for a three-and-out series in the third quarter before going to the sidelines for good. 
Sellers had a strong performance in the opening half. He had scoring runs of 4 and 75 yards, the second the longest ever by a quarterback in Gamecock history, and threw for 112 yards as South Carolina led the Tigers 24-16. 
“He’s got a little bit of an ankle sprain. I think he’s going to be fine,” Gamecocks coach Shane Beamer said the 36-33 loss. 
Sellers was 9-of-16 passing for 113 yards. He ran for 88 yards. 
Sellers said he felt his ankle get rolled on. He said he struggled adjusting to the wrap on his ankle. Sellers did not believe it was serious and expected to be OK going forward.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine an undisclosed number of medium-range cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles in a military aid package totaling about $375 million; a U.S. official also said billions more in assistance over the coming months would be announced Thursday.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the $375 million package as global leaders met at the U.N. General Assembly this week and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used his appearance there to rally support. Zelenskyy will meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington on Thursday to continue his push to get them to allow his troops to use long-range weapon s to strike deeper into Russia. 
The package announced by Blinken includes air-to-ground bombs, which have cluster munitions and can be fired by Ukraine’s fighter jets, as well as munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelin and other anti-armor systems, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, bridging systems and other vehicles and military equipment. 
“The United States is committed to Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s brutal aggression,” Blinken said in a statement. “We will deploy this new assistance as quickly as possible to help Ukraine protect its territory and its people.”
The latest package of weapons, provided through presidential drawdown authority, is one of the largest approved recently and will take stocks from Pentagon shelves to deliver the weapons more quickly to Ukraine. 


It comes as nearly $6 billion in funding for aid to Ukraine could expire at the end of the month unless Congress acts to extend the Pentagon’s authority to send weapons from its stockpiles to Kyiv. 
A U.S. official said, however, that the Biden administration is expected to notify Congress on Thursday of its intent to spend the remaining amount of money under presidential drawdown authority contained in the supplemental budget for Ukraine after the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
That amount, $5.5 billion, must either be used or notified to Congress by Sept. 30 or be lost and returned to the Treasury.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the expected move, said lawmakers would be told that the administration will spend the money in multiple aid packages that will be announced after Oct. 1, in the next budget year.
Ukrainian and Russian forces are battling in the east, including hand-to-hand combat in the Kharkiv border region where Ukraine has driven Russia out of a huge processing plant in the town of Vovchansk that had been occupied for four months, officials said Tuesday. At the same time, Ukrainian troops continue to hold ground in Russia’s Kursk region after a daring incursion there last month.
The aid announcement also came on the heels of Zelenskyy’s highly guarded visit on Sunday to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers who are producing 155 mm shells, one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces. 
Including this latest package, the United States has provided more than $56.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russian forces invaded in February 2022.

ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay (AP) — A powerful drought in Brazil’s Pantanal region led on Monday to the lowest water levels on the Paraguay River in more than a century, disrupting commerce on the major waterway, creating hazards for local transport and offering a grim warning for other parts of the world.

Paraguay’s Department of Meteorology and Hydrology reported that water levels on the country’s namesake river, a regional economic lifeline, dipped 89 centimeters (35 inches) below the meter’s benchmark at the port of Asunción, the capital, the lowest point in 120 years.
(AP Video Emilio Sanabria)

The previous record-breaking drop occurred just three years ago, in October 2021 — a sign, experts say, of how droughts that starve the region’s waterways are becoming more frequent and intense. The Amazon — the world’s most voluminous river — and one of its main tributaries, the Madeira River, have also registered new daily record lows at the city of Tabatinga.

The most immediate effect is being felt across landlocked Paraguay, one of the world’s leading exporters of agricultural commodities, which relies on the river to move 80% of its international commerce. 

The head of Paraguay’s fishing union said Monday that the decline in water levels has put 1,600 fishermen out of work. On Monday, dozens of boats that would normally ply the waterway sat on bone-dry banks of sand.

“I have no way out,” said Fermín Giménez, a sailor who became trapped Monday as the river literally dried up beneath his small barge. “It’s a disaster.”

Originating in Brazil, the Paraguay-Paraná waterway runs 3,400 kilometers (about 2,110 miles) through Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia and into the open seas, making the region a vital transport hub for grain, corn, soy and other agricultural products. 



In the last few days, disruptions have rippled from Paraguay across neighboring countries, with more than half of the river’s shipping capacity halted or tied up in delays, according to Paraguay’s main shipping association. Only so much can be loaded onto cargo ships without the risk of getting stuck along the river’s shallow parts, it said.

That has created expensive headaches in countries including Brazil, which exports iron ore along the river, and Bolivia, which has been forced to reroute badly needed fuel shipments via a slower overland path. Paraguay, which relies on the river to generate electricity, also faces the eventual possibility of cuts in supply, said Raúl Valdez, president of Paraguay’s Center of River and Maritime Shipowners.

With no rainfall expected in the coming weeks, industry officials said there’s no relief in sight. They anticipate losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

“Our main question is, will this now be a new pattern? No one is expecting a quick recovery,” Valdez said. “It’s a major concern for the whole region.” 

Experts said the drying of the Paraguay River — as with other rivers from Colorado to France to Brazil’s Amazon — reflects how population growth, climate change and deforestation have increasingly conspired with weak governance and inefficient irrigation practices to transform landscapes, upending delicate ecosystems and sending scores of communities scrambling for fresh water.

“All over we are seeing increases in droughts; they are longer, more intense, more frequent and more difficult to recover from,” said Rachael McDonnell, deputy director-general for research at the International Water Management Institute.

As rainfall becomes more erratic and the warming climate intensifies the cycles of flood and drought, McDonnell added, “we’ve lost the slack in the system.” 

With Brazil in the grips of the worst drought since since nationwide measurements began over seven decades ago, wildfires are also raging further downstream, in the forests along Paraguay’s northeast border with Brazil, where residents said Monday the air smelled of acrid smoke, and in parts of Bolivia, where the government has declared a national emergency.

TORONTO (AP) — Red Sox closer and four-time All-Star Kenley Jansen will miss the final six games of the season after being placed on the 15-day injured list Monday because of a sore right shoulder.
Boston recalled right-hander Chase Shugart from Triple-A Worcester.
Jansen, who turns 37 next week, went 4-2 with a 3.29 ERA and 27 saves in 31 chances for the Red Sox in 2024, his 15th big league season. He’ll become a free agent following the World Series.
Jansen struck out a batter in a scoreless inning Sunday in the opener of a split doubleheader sweep over Minnesota. Manager Alex Cora said after the second game that Jansen had been sore and was likely to go on the IL.
The NL saves leader with the Dodgers in 2017 and the Braves in 2022, Jansen won a World Series title with Los Angeles in 2020. He pitched for Atlanta in 2022 before signing a two-year contract with Boston before the 2023 season.

TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Three games into the regular season, the Arizona Cardinals look like the team that many expected to see this fall.
They’re often exciting on offense. They’re better on defense. They usually get good quarterback play from Kyler Murray. They’ve got a potential star in rookie receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. 
And it’s still not quite enough to push the Cardinals into the upper tier of the NFL — at least for the moment.
Arizona (1-2) is coming off a 20-13 loss to the Detroit on Sunday. Since the Lions are considered a Super Bowl contender, there was no shame in what was a very competitive game. The same could be said for their season-opening loss to the Buffalo Bills — who have been a perennial playoff team in recent years.
But losses are losses, and the Cardinals have had a lot of those the past few years following back-to-back 4-13 seasons.
Even so, Murray remains confident.
“I love what we have in the locker room,” Murray said on Sunday. “We just didn’t make enough plays today. I know those plays are out there to be made and we will make them.”
There were some encouraging moments from Sunday. The Murray-to-Harrison connection produced its third touchdown in two games, and the rookie finished with five catches for 64 yards. Dennis Gardeck had an interception, making another big play one week after having three sacks against the Los Angeles Rams. The defense held Detroit scoreless in the second half.
But the big offensive gains were hard to find. The Lions limited the Cardinals to just 277 yards. 


“I think we were 1 for 9 on third downs. That’s not good,” Murray said. “That’s not how you beat a playoff team and win those types of games.”

Murray has played 11 games since returning from a torn ACL midway through last season and it appears his running ability is as good as ever. He ran for 45 yards on five carries against the Lions and has consistently extended plays this season with his ability to dance around would-be tacklers.
The Cardinals’ running game — outside of those Murray scrambles — didn’t do much against the Lions. James Conner ran for a season-low 17 yards on nine carries and Arizona finished with just 77 yards rushing.
“We knew it was going to be dirty (with) 2, 3 yards but you’re kind of waiting for that one to pop,” coach Jonathan Gannon said. “Hats off to them. They did a good job.”
WR Michael Wilson made some tough catches on Sunday, finishing with eight receptions for 64 yards. The second-year receiver caught eight of nine targets from Murray and could continue to have big games with opposing defenses focusing so heavily on Harrison.
Rookie RB Trey Benson was expected to make an immediate impact after being drafted in the third round out of Florida State, but he hasn’t done much through three games. He’s run for just 31 yards on 16 carries, averaging 1.9 yards per rush.
DT Justin Jones (triceps), RT Jackson Barton (toe) and DT Khyiris Tonga (knee) all left Sunday’s game with injuries. Gannon said all of them were still being evaluated on Monday. TE Trey McBride is in concussion protocol.
3 — The Cardinals managed just a field goal in the second half despite having seven possessions. Three of the drives ended with a punt, two on downs and one with an interception. Matt Prater’s 45-yard field goal in the fourth quarter produced the only points.
The Cardinals play their third straight home game against the Washington Commanders on Sunday. Washington’s offensive coordinator is Kliff Kingsbury, who coached Murray for his first four seasons in the NFL before getting fired in 2022.

HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese authorities have banned the accounting firm PwC for six months and fined it over 400 million yuan ($56.4 million) over its involvement in the audit of collapsed property developer Evergrande.
The punishment is the heaviest yet for international accounting firms operating in China. PwC will be banned from signing off on any financial results in the country for six months. Already, it has been losing clients.
China’s Ministry of Finance said in a statement Friday that it was imposing 116 million yuan ($16.35 million) in fines and confiscation of illegal gains on PwC Zhong Tian, also known as PwC China, as well as a six-month business suspension, revocation of PwC’s Guangzhou branch and an administrative warning.
A separate regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, also imposed fines and confiscations totaling 325 million yuan ($45.8 million) on PwC for allegedly failing to perform due diligence in the audit of Evergrande.
China’s finance ministry said PwC issued “false audit reports” of Evergrande and that the audit procedures had “serious defects” in design and implementation, leading to many false conclusions. It also accused PwC of not maintaining “professional skepticism” and failing to point out errors and a lack of information disclosure by Evergrande during the audits.
The securities regulator said 88% of the records kept by PwC regarding the real estate projects were inconsistent with the actual implementation and were “seriously unreliable.” When on-site investigations were carried out, some projects were still “a piece of vacant land” despite being considered to have met the delivery conditions, the regulator said.


“The work performed by PwC Zhong Tian’s Hengda audit team fell well below our high expectations and was completely unacceptable,” Mohamed Kande, global chair of PwC, said in a statement on its website. Hengda is the principal subsidiary of China Evergrande Group.
“It is not representative of what we stand for as a network and there is no room for this at PwC,” he said.
The statement said PwC Zhong Tian has cooperated fully with regulators, respects their decisions and will fully comply with the administrative penalties.
PwC China has fired six partners and five staff directly involved in the Hengda audit, it said. The firm is also in the process of issuing financial penalties for current and former firm leaders who were responsible for the business, the statement said.
PwC came under Beijing’s scrutiny after the January collapse of Evergrande, the world’s most indebted developer and a symbol of China’s ongoing property crisis.
China’s securities regulator said in March that Evergrande had inflated its mainland China revenues by almost $80 billion in 2019 and 2020. In May, authorities fined the company $577 million.
PwC had audited Evergrande’s accounts for 14 years until 2023 and gave it a clean bill of health.
PwC has been the largest of the “big four” accounting firms operating in China, taking in nearly 8 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in revenues in 2022, above competitors Deloitte, KPMG and EY, according to the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
China has been cracking down on excessive borrowing by developers during a prolonged property market slump that has hit many other parts of the economy, including construction, building materials and home appliances.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich was appointed captain of Germany’s national team Monday after his predecessor Ilkay Gündogan was among a string of senior players to retire from international duty after Euro 2024.
Kimmich will be backed up by two vice-captains, Real Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger and Arsenal forward Kai Havertz, when he takes up the captaincy for upcoming Nations League games against Hungary on Saturday and the Netherlands on Sept. 10.
The 29-year-old Kimmich hasn’t been the permanent captain for Bayern or the national team before, but he has often stepped into the role when other players have been injured or unavailable. He last started a Germany game as captain in friendlies last year.
The German soccer federation said Monday that Kimmich had worn the captain’s armband 17 times in a career spanning 91 international games. That total appeared to include games in which Kimmich took over the captaincy when another player was substituted. 
Gündogan was named captain by then-coach Hansi Flick last year ahead of Germany hosting 2024, when the team reached the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champion Spain. He retired from international duty last month ahead of a return from Barcelona to Manchester City. 
Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said Kimmich was the “logical successor” to Gündogan as captain.
Other players who have retired from the national team since Euro 2024 include goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Müller, both teammates of Kimmich at Bayern. Midfielder Toni Kroos retired from all soccer following the tournament.


Despite the high-profile retirements, Nagelsmann has named a squad with only one uncapped player for the Nations League, saying there had been “enough changes.”
Also Monday, Nagelsmann confirmed he sees Barcelona’s Marc-André ter Stegen as Germany’s new starting goalkeeper in place of Neuer as Germany plans for the 2026 World Cup. That decision was widely expected after ter Stegen spent much of his international career so far as Neuer’s backup.

Last meeting: Titans beat Dolphins 28-27 on Dec. 11, 2023, in Miami Gardens, Florida.
Last week: Titans lost to Packers 30-14; Dolphins lost to Seahawks 24-3.

Turnover differential: Titans minus-7; Dolphins even.
Will Levis. The second-year quarterback will be making his 13th NFL start back at the stadium where he had his biggest clutch moment, rallying the Titans to 15 points in 51 seconds for a comeback victory. That was his lone 300-yard passing game in the NFL. Levis has had to learn a second offense with Brian Callahan getting used to being both a first-time head coach and play-caller. Levis already has one more interception than he had in nine starts as a rookie with with five, including a pair of pick-6s. He also has three fumbles, two off strip-sacks. 
Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. The NFL’s leading receiving duo from 2023 has had a quiet start to the season. Hill caught an 80-yard touchdown pass to go with 130 receiving yards in the season opener, but he has not had more than 50 receiving yards in a game since. Waddle hasn’t had more than 41 receiving yards since going for 101 in the opener. The duo combined for just seven catches and 66 yards in Week 3. Waddle said teams employ a lot of two-deep safety coverages to take the two star receivers out of games early, but he added that it’s up to him to get separation in one-on-one matchups to make it easier for the quarterback to get him the ball.


Titans run game vs. Dolphins run defense. Miami defensive tackle Calais Campbell said the team’s rushing defense so far this season “is not our standard” after the Dolphins gave up 112 rushing yards per game and 4.5 yards per carry in the first three weeks. Miami has also been burned for huge plays on the ground. Buffalo’s James Cook had a 49-yard touchdown run against the Dolphins in Week 2. Travis Etienne had a 26-yard carry against them in Week 1. Campbell said the Titans could be the best rushing team they’ve faced so far because of Will Levis’ scrambling ability and the production of Tony Pollard, who has 158 yards on 39 carries. The Titans also are looking to get backup Tyjae Spears more involved. Spears had 118 yards from scrimmage with his pass-catching skills out of the backfield in Miami last December.

Before their 2023 meeting, the previous time the teams met in Miami Gardens, Fla. was on Sept. 9, 2018, when a weather delay turned the matchup into a 7-hour, 8-minute game — the longest in NFL history. Then-Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill led a 27-20 win.
The Dolphins were held to three points in last week’s loss, their lowest-scoring output since Mike McDaniel was hired in 2022. ... Skylar Thompson was ineffective in his first start since he was a rookie in 2022, completing 13 of 19 passes for 107 yards. ...

He leads the league with eight turnovers. ... The Titans have held their first three opponents this season to an average of 139.3 yards per game. If they keep Miami below 200 yards passing Monday night, it would be the longest streak for the franchise since the first five games of 1986. ... Five-time Pro Bowl WR DeAndre Hopkins is coming off his best game this season with six catches for a team-high 73 yards and a TD. He had a team-high seven receptions for 124 yards and a TD that jump-started the Titans. ... P Ryan Stonehouse has had 10 straight games played with at least one punt of 55 yards or longer, the NFL’s longest active streak. ... OLB Harold Landry has three sacks. ... LB Kenneth Murray had a career-high two sacks last week against Green Bay. ... S Jamal Adams is three tackles shy of 500. 
The running backs for both teams could be in for big games against two struggling run defenses. Dolphins running back De’Von Achane leads the team with 43 carries for 150 yards with one rushing touchdown, while Pollard is averaging 4.1 yards per carry and is having a productive season outside of being bottled up by the Packers last week.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Aaron Rodgers was eager to get back on the field and feel a few firsts in his return from an Achilles injury that cut his first season with the New York Jets short after only four snaps.
The first throw, the first hit, the first touchdown in a new uniform. 
There was also the first loss as Rodgers showed some flashes of his four-time MVP form in a 32-19 loss to the San Francisco 49ers but also a little bit of expected rust after such a long layoff.
“We expect greatness when we step on the field,” Rodgers said. “There were moments, moments that felt pretty good but not sustained. I felt like if we could just get a first down we’d be rolling. But we had those three and outs which hurt us. I think a lot of stuff is correctable.” 
Rodgers showed signs of his old self, connecting on a well-placed back-shoulder throw to his new No. 1 receiver Garrett Wilson in the first half and hitting his old Green Bay teammate Allen Lazard on a 36-yard scoring strike in the third quarter.
But those were just a few flashes on a night when he didn’t look comfortable moving in the pocket in his first back from the serious injury and struggled to move the ball consistently for the Jets.
Rodgers finished 13 for 21 for 167 with the touchdown and one interception. He threw for fewer yards only 13 times in 218 previous starts when he played at least 35 snaps.


“I can play better,” he said. “I missed a couple of throws. ... I felt overall I got the ball out pretty good but there were some opportunities I’d like to have back.”
Rodgers’ second game with the Jets lasted much longer than his first, which ended with a season-ending Achilles injury after just four snaps in 2023.

New York went three-and-out on the opening drive this game with two handoffs and a dropped pass by Lazard before a setback on the fourth snap that was temporary instead of season ending this time around. Rodgers’ first completion as a Jet was caught by Breece Hall, who had the ball punched out by Fred Warner for a lost fumble that set up a Niners field goal.
Rodgers got the Jets moving on the following drive, converting three third-down passes to Wilson to set up Hall’s 3-yard TD run. Rodgers went 6 for 7 for 61 yards on the drive.
“It was awesome man, it’s great,” Wilson said about having Rodgers back. “Having him in the huddle, we’re just going to get better. As far as seeing him out there healthy, staying healthy throughout the whole game, it was a good feeling.”
New York didn’t get another first down until early in the third quarter after the 49ers had taken a 23-7 lead. Two plays after Rodgers’ 12-yard pass to Hall, Rodgers threw his first interception with New York. His pass to Wilson was deflected by Deommodore Lenoir into the hands of linebacker Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles.
The Jets struggled to get in a rhythm as the Niners bottled up Hall and the running game and the defense couldn’t make stops. New York ran just 37 offensive plays with Rodgers in the game before Tyrod Taylor took over on the final drive.
“We just didn’t see the field as much as we’d like,” coach Robert Saleh said. “I think our running game is going to be fine, but we only ran 49 plays today. We never got a chance to establish what we’re trying to establish.” 
Rodgers provided his biggest highlight on his next drive when he took advantage of a free play when Leonard Floyd jumped offsides to throw his first TD pass in 610 days on the deep pass over the middle to Lazard.
It was Lazard who also caught Rodgers’ last TD pass in Green Bay in the final game of the 2022 season before he was traded to New York where he was supposed to fill the void of a franchise quarterback that Jets fans have been waiting a half-century for since Joe Namath left town. 
The 40-year-old Rodgers spent his first 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, winning four MVPs and one Super Bowl. He was traded before the 2023 season to the quarterback-starved Jets. New York has gone through 15 starting QBs since last making the playoffs in 2010 with Mark Sanchez for the longest active postseason drought in the NFL.
But Rodgers’ first season with New York ended almost as quickly as it started. He ran onto the field with an American flag as part of a pregame celebration. 
Then on his opening drive against Buffalo, Rodgers threw one incompletion and was sacked by Leonard Floyd and injured the Achilles. Rodgers made an attempt to return late last season but was unable to pull it off, setting the stage for his return in his native California against San Francisco — the team that memorably skipped over drafting him No. 1 overall in 2005 to take Alex Smith instead.
“It’s been a while,” he said. “I felt great, a lot of gratitude just to be back in pads. So many people helped me get back to this spit so I’m really thankful.”

Lincoln Riley has yet to deliver the level of success Southern California fans hoped for when he made a shocking move west from Oklahoma after the 2021 regular season.
USC is better than it was when Riley arrived but as the No. 11 Trojans’ loss at No. 18 Michigan suggests, they are not entering the Big Ten as serious contenders to win their new conference. It’s fair to say, more was expected of Riley than 21-9 after 30 games.
The school Riley left behind also played its first game in a new league Saturday night, and No. 15 Oklahoma made it clear it will not be challenging for the Southeastern Conference championship. The Sooners were smothered by No. 6 Tennessee in Volunteers coach Josh Huepel’s return to Norman.
Riley has become a pariah in Oklahoma. Sooners fans have reveled in his struggles at USC and are convinced OU is better off without him. But Brent Venables, Riley’s replacement, is 19-11 at Oklahoma.
Venables’ Oklahoma is most definitely different from Riley’s.
Even while Riley was going 55-10 with two Heisman Trophy winners in five years at OU, his teams played little defense and never felt like a threat to win a national title as they stacked up Big 12 titles.
Riley’s Oklahoma program appeared to be slipping and the way he constructed a roster certainly didn’t seem like a recipe for success in the SEC. In fact, some of his detractors suggested Riley fled OU because he feared leading the transition into the toughest conference in the country.


Venables, the former defensive coordinator at Clemson, has taken a different approach. He has stressed building up the lines and playing salty defense. The problem is that now the offense is a mess.
Oklahoma came into the Tennessee game averaging less than 5.0 yards per play under new coordinator Seth Littrell and then was held to 3.3 by Heupel’s Volunteers, who — to be fair — are nasty up front.
So who is better off, USC or Oklahoma?
Riley tried to address the defensive issues in the offseason with a staff overhaul, starting with luring D’Anton Lynn from UCLA to be defensive coordinator.
The Trojans have been better defensively. Of course, the bar set by former defensive coordinator Alex Grinch was really low. Still, there is work to be done after allowing 290 yards rushing to a Michigan team without a functional passing game.
“It’d be interesting to go back and look at it, but I mean we probably played – probably won – 80-85% of the defensive snaps,” Riley said. “But we lost some of them big.”
Three long runs accounted for 154 yards for Michigan.
USC is also not where it needs to be on the offensive line, which is going to hold back the side of the ball where Riley thrives, especially in the Big Ten.
Meanwhile, at Oklahoma, Venables benched highly touted second-year quarterback Jackson Arnold during the Tennessee game for freshman Michael Hawkins Jr. 
“He’s a tough young man and he knows he has to be better,” Venables said of Arnold.
Not including sacks, Oklahoma averaged 2.0 yards per carry.
Oklahoma fans have swapped lamenting what their team could be with a competent defense to longing for a solid offense to support an ascending defense.
After more than a decade of dysfunction at USC following the Pete Carroll era, there are more positive signs now under Riley than with any of his predecessors. But, again, that’s not saying much.
For now, both sides of Riley’s move are still hoping for more.
Games like USC-Michigan will help college football fans adapt to the demise of the Pac-12.
The 11th-ranked Trojans and 18th-ranked Wolverines played a regular-season game for the first time in 66 years and it was an instant Big Ten classic.
When conference officials and television executives came up with the idea of a Big Ten West Wing, this is exactly what they had in mind.
“Can’t believe we’re stuck with this game when we could be watching SC play Cal in front of 40,000 empty seats,” Fox Sports executive Michael Mulvihill posted on X.
Fox shares the Big Ten’s rights with CBS and NBC.
USC-Michigan was on CBS and no doubt drew a monster audience that will make the network’s suits thrilled with their $350-million-a-year investment.
But that’s how they get you: with USC at Michigan going down to the wire on a sunny Saturday in front of 110,000 fans; with No. 6 Tennessee at No. 15 Oklahoma in the Sooners’ first SEC game, played later Saturday.
It’s cold but true. The games always seem to deliver.
More than a year after the Pac-12 fell apart, with its traditional members scattered to other power conferences, all this realignment is producing some weird stuff.
On Friday night, Stanford made a cross-country trip to Syracuse to play its first game as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.
It is fair to ask: What is the point of all this?
Then the Cardinal and Orange played a thriller, won by Stanford with a walk-off field goal, and the absurdity of it all fades and fans forget the greedy and destructive off-field decisions the people who run college football so often make.
Shedeur Sanders conjured up memories of Kordell Stewart with a game-tying touchdown pass on the final play of regulation against Baylor in Colorado’s first Big 12 game since 2010. Then Travis Hunter sealed the field-storming victory in overtime by forcing a fumble inches from the goal line. He also had seven catches for 130 yards. ... Best team in the Big 12? No. 12 Utah is the obvious choice after the Utes won at No. 14 Oklahoma State without injured QB Cam Rising (hand) and No. 13 Kansas State had an epic meltdown at BYU.... No. 7 Missouri was taken to the brink by Vanderbilt, and escaped with a double-overtime victory that ended with the Commodores missing a short field goal that would have tied it and kept the game going. ... Florida got a win at Mississippi State that might buy coach Billy Napier at least a few more weeks. The school is without a president and there isn’t a lot of upside in firing a coach in September and opening up a transfer portal window for the players. The Gators do have an open week before their next game against UCF in the Swamp on Oct. 5. As for the Bulldogs (1-3), they look as if they are starting from scratch in Year 1 under coach Jeff Lebby. ... Since leaving Georgia behind in Week 1, No. 21 Clemson has been unstoppable. The Tigers have bounced back from that humbling loss by outscoring Appalachian State and N.C. State by a combined 101-20 — in the first half. Even taking degree of difficulty into account, Clemson’s offense and QB Cade Klubnik have been unrecognizable from last season. Before kicking a field goal on the last play of the first half against N.C. State, the Tigers scored touchdowns on 14 of 15 first-half possessions over the last two games. ... No. 23 Northern Illinois followed up beating Notre Dame by losing at home in overtime to Buffalo. MACtion! ... Both James Madison’s old coach and JMU with a new coach remain unbeaten. Former Dukes coach Curt Cignetti has Indiana at 4-0 for the first time since 2020 after another blowout, this time against Charlotte. The Hoosiers have outscored their opposition 150-23 so far. Meanwhile, JMU under former Holy Cross coach Bob Chesney moved to 3-0 by dropping 53 points on North Carolina in the first half, the most ever allowed by the Tar Heels in a half. “Embarrassing day, shocking day,” UNC coach Mack Brown said.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minnesota man has been sentenced to a 30-year prison term for killing a transgender woman last year in Minneapolis.
Damarean Bible, 25, was found guilty of second-degree murder in August and sentenced Wednesday, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Bible admitted fatally shooting 38-year-old Savannah Ryan Williams on Nov. 29.
“She was my best friend and meant everything to me,” Williams’ mother, Kim Stillday, said at the sentencing hearing. “As a person, Savannah was funny. She would light up any room she walked into.”
Prosecutor James Hannemon called the shooting “a cold-blooded, brazen killing” that was unprovoked. 
“She just had the great misfortune of coming across a person who valued her life so little,” he said.
Bible spoke briefly at the hearing.
“I completely apologize,” Bible said. “I feel like I do need to sit down and do some time.”
Bible told police he began to feel “suspicious” while engaged in a sex act with Williams and shot her in the head.
It was the second attack on a transgender woman near the same light-rail station in 2023. Two men pleaded guilty to severely beating a trans woman during a robbery in February 2023, although prosecutors concluded that attack was not motivated by bias. The local LGBTQ+ community was also roiled by a shooting at a mostly queer and trans punk rock show in August 2023 that left one person dead and six injured. 
Nationally, the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, said in an annual report in November that it has recorded the deaths of 335 transgender and gender-nonconforming victims of violence, including at least 33 deaths in the preceding 12 months. The group said the victims were “overwhelmingly young and people of color, with Black trans women disproportionately impacted.”
LGBTQ+ activists had urged prosecutors to treat Williams’ death as a hate crime, but Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said there wasn’t enough evidence to prove Bible’s motive.

DENVER (AP) — A couple of things gleaned from Thursday’s media day for the Denver Nuggets: Nikola Jokic can grow a first-rate beard/goatee, Jamal Murray has aspirations to be an MMA fighter and Aaron Gordon held one impressive yard sale this summer as he cleaned out his closet.
Oh, and that not defending their crown sat well with absolutely no one. They’re eager to scale that NBA mountaintop again only with a different look. Gone are Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Reggie Jackson. Brought in are Russell Westbrook and Dario Saric.
Of course, there are the mainstays in Jokic, now a three-time NBA MVP, and Murray, who’s fresh off signing a 4-year, $208M max contract extension. The Nuggets are coming off a season in which they tied the franchise’s NBA record for wins (57) only to be eliminated in the second-round of the playoffs to Minnesota. Denver squandered a 20-point second-half lead in Game 7 at home.
“After a season where everybody says we failed, it’s my job to make sure that we don’t believe all that (expletive),” said Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who guided the team to their first NBA championship in 2022-23. “We’re a good team. The last six years, no one in the West has come close to doing what we’ve done. Remind yourself of that, but also challenge yourself to not be satisfied. Push yourself and push your teammate to become even better.”
Nuggets general manager Calvin Booth estimated that Jokic has a 10-year prime contention window and they’re about halfway through it.


“You hit one of them it’s great,” Booth said. “It’s going to be incredibly hard to win another one.”
On the docket for Booth, negotiating a contract extension with Gordon, which he can do starting Friday. Gordon is coming off a season in which he averaged 13.9 points and 6.5 rebounds in his do-a-little-bit-of-everything role.
“I really love this organization,” Gordon said. “I hope we get it done.”
Gordon switched his jersey to No. 32 this season to honor his brother, Drew, who died four months ago in car crash in Oregon. Aaron Gordon said his teammates helped him through it.
“These guys have been there for me every step of the way,” Gordon said. “These guys have really developed into people that I would call my brothers.”
Gordon has long been a fan favorite. That was evident when he opened up his wardrobe to fans this summer. His pop-up event was well received. 
“Just a yard sale,” he cracked. “It just happened to get a little out of hand. It’s a great community. They’ve accepted me and I’m just grateful for it.”
On Thursday, Murray wasn’t exactly in an expansive mood during his time at the podium, but he did reveal his affection for mixed martial arts. He worked out with former UFC featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski. 
“I might have a career there after this,” said Murray, who struggled for Team Canada over the summer at the Paris Games. “But I’m doing this right now.”
Murray forms quite an on-court partnership with Jokic, who showed up with a beard/goatee he’s already contemplating nixing. Jokic enters training camp on the high of helping Serbia to an Olympic bronze medal in Paris. He has already picked up his first assist of the year, too, by playing a role in bringing Westbrook to town.
“Great, great player for us,” said Jokic, who earned his third NBA MVP award in four seasons after a regular season averaging 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and nine assists. “He’s going to bring us all the good stuff.”
Westbrook joined the Nuggets in an effort to capture the one thing missing from his distinguished resume — a title.
“As long as we as a team put our best foot forward, we can live with the results,” Westbrook said. “If it’s a championship, I’m grateful for that. If it’s not, I’m also grateful for the opportunity.”
Westbrook was in a jovial mood Thursday, playfully mimicking Murray’s signature “Blue Arrow” pose as Murray took pictures. It brought a grin to Murray.
That’s just Westbrook’s personality.
“People confuse intensity with competitiveness,” Westbrook said. “When I’m on the floor, I don’t want to be walking around, shaking hands, kissing babies. I’m there to kick some (butt). Of the floor, I’m chill.”
Notes: Altitude announced a deal to offer Nuggets and Avalanche games through a streaming app along with a handful of games on local broadcasts. Altitude TV has been in a long-running dispute with Comcast, the state’s largest cable provider, which has not carried Altitude since their previous deal expired in 2019. ... The contenders to join Murray, Jokic, Michael Porter Jr. and Gordon in the starting lineup appear to be Christian Braun and Julian Strawther. ... Porter, who’s had back issues in the past, took advantage of a healthy offseason by getting in even more work on the court.

Verizon is buying Frontier Communications in a $20 billion deal to strengthen its fiber network.
Verizon Communications Inc. said Thursday that the acquisition will also shore up its foray into artificial intelligence as well as connected smart devices. 
Frontier has concentrated heavily on its fiber network capabilities over about four years, investing $4.1 billion upgrading and expanding its fiber network. It now gets more than half of its revenue from fiber products. 
The price tag for Frontier, based in Dallas, is sizeable given its 2.2 million fiber subscribers across 25 states. Verizon has approximately 7.4 million Fios connections in nine states and Washington, D.C. 
Frontier has 7.2 million fiber locations and has plans to build out an additional 2.8 million fiber locations by the end of 2026.
“The acquisition of Frontier is a strategic fit,” Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said in a prepared statement. “It will build on Verizon’s two decades of leadership at the forefront of fiber and is an opportunity to become more competitive in more markets throughout the United States, enhancing our ability to deliver premium offerings to millions more customers across a combined fiber network.”
There are skeptics of the potential for Verizon’s $20 billion acquisition, however. 
“The real issue is simply that Frontier’s paltry 3.5% national fiber coverage (again, according to the FCC’s broadband map as of end of 2023) would leave Verizon with a combined fiber footprint that still covers less than 13% of the country, with a path to potentially take that only to about 17% of the country,” Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson Research wrote. “A fiber footprint covering 17% of the U.S. is nowhere near large enough to be the basis of a strategy for a national wireless operator.” 


Verizon, based in New York City, will pay $38.50 for each Frontier share. The deal is expected to close in about 18 months. It still needs approval from Frontier shareholders. 
Shares of Frontier Communications Parents Inc., which were halted briefly on Wednesday after a report from the Wall Street Journal about the deal sent the stock up nearly 40%, fell 9% Thursday. Verizon’s stock dipped slightly.",False

Publication date:2024-09-30 22:24:00

PHOENIX (AP) — The so-called Big 3 was a big disappointment for the Phoenix Suns in Year 1.
Now the franchise hopes a little continuity for their star trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal — along with a revamped supporting cast — can help Year 2 be much more successful.
The Suns gathered in downtown Phoenix on Monday morning, roughly five months after getting swept out of the first round of the playoffs by the Minnesota Timberwolves after a 49-33 record during the regular season. Booker relished the fresh start, but also said the disappointment of last season still lingered just a little.
In the four-time All-Star’s mind, that’s not a bad thing.
“I think going out in the fashion that we did, it’s something that you just don’t want to blow by it and act like it never happened,” Booker said. “It’s something we have to accept and use as motivation. Experience is the best teacher. 
“We have that terrible experience under our belt. Now we use it for motivation.”
The Suns were active during the offseason, adding new coach Mike Budenholzer, who replaced Frank Vogel after just one season. Budenholzer is an Arizona native and was the coach of the Milwaukee Bucks in 2021 when they rallied from a 2-0 deficit to beat the Suns in the Finals.
Phoenix has been to the Finals three times, including 1976 and 1993, but never won a championship.
“It’s all talk at this stage,” Budenholzer said. “I’m just like any other coach — trying to get my team ready for practice tomorrow, get ready for games and be the best we can.”


Phoenix also made some shrewd moves on the free agency market, beefing up their backcourt by adding veteran point guards Tyus Jones and Monte Morris. They also signed veteran center Mason Plumlee, who will be a backup big man behind Jusuf Nurkic.
Jones averaged 7.3 assists and just one turnover last season. He signed a $3 million, one-year deal in July that was viewed as well-below market value, but the 28-year-old wanted to join a winner and potentially raise his value for an even bigger payday next offseason.
“We got him for a steal,” Booker said.
Durant and Booker had a busy summer as vital parts of the U.S. basketball team that won the gold medal in Paris. The ageless Durant — who just turned 36 years old — has a lot of mileage on his body, but has been remarkably durable over the past year.
Booker is in his prime, entering his 10th season in the NBA. He’s still just 27 years old — relatively young in the NBA — but has already played nearly 650 career games between the regular season and playoffs. A few years ago, he used to tease veteran teammate Chris Paul about his extensive routines to keep his body healthy.
Now he’s starting to understand.
“I’m always a sponge,” Booker said. “You see that guys have all their different ways to stay healthy and KD is one of the guys I’ve watched closely.”
Then there’s Beal, who missed much of the first half of the season with various injuries and never quite looked comfortable in his role under Vogel. The three-time All-Star averaged 21 points last season despite those frustrations and is looking forward to a mulligan with a revamped roster.
“I feel ecstatic right now, I’m super excited, just to have a good summer,” Beal said. “I never really got off to a good start (last season). Now, I get to do that. Everybody’s acclimated with each other, so we’re past that phase.
“Now we can just hit the ground running.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Another top adviser to New York City Mayor Eric Adams resigned Monday, even as the Democrat’s lawyer criticized the federal corruption case against him and asked a judge to toss out bribery charges.
Timothy Pearson, one of the mayor’s closest confidants, submitted his resignation Monday evening, weeks after federal agents seized cellphones, documents and cash from his Long Island home, said his attorney, Hugh H. Mo.
Pearson, a retired police inspector who served in the department alongside Adams, had a broad role that included overseeing contracts and security at migrant shelters while also maintaining significant influence over the police department.
He has not been publicly accused of wrongdoing by prosecutors or charged with a crime.
Adams, a Democrat, pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he accepted lavish travel benefits and illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official and others, and in return performed favors including pushing through the opening of a Turkish consulate building.
The mayor’s attorneys filed a motion Monday saying that the cheap flights to overseas destinations, seat upgrades, free meals and free hotel rooms he got were not bribes under federal law.
“Congressmen get upgrades. They get corner suites. They get better tables at restaurants. They get free appetizers. They have their iced tea filled up,” his attorney, Alex Spiro, said at a news conference. “Courtesies to politicians are not federal crimes.”


While not disputing that Adams accepted flight upgrades and deeply discounted or free travel, Spiro said his client had never promised to take action on behalf of the Turkish government in exchange for the perks, which prosecutors say were worth more than $100,000.
“There was no quid pro quo. There was no this for that,” Spiro said.
Besides the case against Adams, prosecutors are conducting investigations into several top city officials. The drumbeat of searches and subpoenas in recent weeks has prompted the resignation of the city’s police commissioner and schools chancellor.
Even before the federal scrutiny, Pearson had been seen as a political liability for Adams.
AP correspondent Julie Walker reports attorneys for New York City Mayor Eric Adams seek the dismissal of a bribery charge.
While serving as an adviser to the mayor, he was also collecting a paycheck as an executive at a casino seeking a state contract — an arrangement that ended after it was revealed by The New York Times two years ago. 
His role in a brawl at migrant shelter last fall, where he was accused of physically attacking security guards, is being probed by the city’s Department of Investigation. And he faces multiple lawsuits accusing him of sexually harassing female subordinates while leading a new unit created by Adams to monitor other city agencies.
“A lot of allegations have been swirling in the media for months,” Mo said. “There are no merits to these allegations.
In recent months, Adams has repeatedly defended Pearson, describing him as a “good friend.” That staunch support had created fissures within City Hall, according to multiple people who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel decisions.
City Hall’s chief legal counsel, Lisa Zornberg, recently resigned after Adams refused her advice to fire Pearson and another aide, one of those people said.
In a statement Monday, Adams said Pearson had spent 30 years “keeping New Yorkers safe” in both the public and private sector. “We appreciate Tim’s decades of service to this city and wish him well,” Adams said.
Gov. Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat who has the power to remove Adams from office, told reporters Monday that she had spoken to the mayor about “what my expectations are” but also indicated she wasn’t ready to give up on his administration.
“I am giving the mayor an opportunity now to demonstrate to New Yorkers — and to me — that we are righting the ship, that we have the opportunity to instill the confidence that I think is wavering right now and to power forward with an effective government,” she said. 
At a news conference Monday, Spiro initially said Adams was not legally obligated to disclose any of the trips or upgrades he received from Turkish officials and businesspeople, but later acknowledged that he was not an expert in the city’s rules.
He also said a former Adams staffer had lied to prosecutors to make it seem like the mayor had firsthand knowledge of illegal donations.
“Eventually New Yorkers, being New Yorkers, are going to wise up to all this,” Spiro said. 
Prosecutors say that after Adams won the Democratic mayoral primary in 2021, a Turkish official who had been involved in arranging his discounted travel asked him to expedite the opening of the country’s new diplomatic facility in New York, which fire safety inspectors said was not safe to occupy.
Adams then sent a series of text messages to the fire commissioner pushing for him to open the building, the indictment said.
In another corruption case, federal prosecutors told a judge Monday that ex-fire chief Brian Cordasco intends to plead guilty to a conspiracy charge stemming from allegations that he took bribes from certain people and companies to expedite fire inspections and approvals.
Cordasco and another former chief of the department’s fire-safety division, Anthony Saccavino, were arrested earlier this month. Both pleaded not guilty.
That indictment made no reference to projects linked to the Turkish government, but did refer to a “City Hall List” allegedly used by the department to prioritize inspections. At a news conference after the arrests, Manhattan-based U.S. Attorney Damian Williams declined to say whether the case against the pair was related to “any other investigation we may or may not be doing.”",False

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a barrage of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles at Kyiv and possibly other cities, Ukraine’s air force said early Monday.
Several series of explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Monday, sending residents into bomb shelters.
Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said emergency services were called to the Holosiivskyi and Solomianskyi districts of Kyiv. One person was reportedly injured by falling debris in Shevchenkivskyi district, Klitschko said.
“There will be an answer for everything. The enemy will feel it,” the head of the Presidential Office, Andrii Yermak, posted on his Telegram page following the attack.
According to the air force, Russia fired several groups of cruise missiles accompanied by ballistic missile launches and a few drones, targeting Kyiv.
An explosion also rang out in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, according to Ukrainian media. 
The barrage comes a day after Russia’s military reported intercepting and destroying 158 Ukrainian drones targeting multiple Russian regions in one of the biggest attacks of the war that has raged for about 2 1/2 years. 
Forty-six of the drones were over the Kursk region, where Ukraine has sent its forces in recent weeks in the largest incursion on Russian soil since World War II. A further 34 were shot over the Bryansk region, 28 over the Voronezh region, and 14 over the Belgorod region — all of which border Ukraine.


Drones were also shot down deeper into Russia, including one each in the Tver region, northwest of Moscow, and the Ivanovo region, northeast of the Russian capital. Russia’s Defense Ministry said drones were intercepted over 15 regions, while one other governor said a drone was shot down over his region, too.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that falling debris from one of the two drones shot down over the city caused a fire at an oil refinery.
Ukrainian drone strikes have brought the fight far from the front line into the heart of Russia. Since the beginning of the year, Ukraine has stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals to slow down the Kremlin’s assault.
Also in Russia, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said 11 people were wounded in Ukrainian aerial missile attacks in the Russian border region of Belgorod on Sunday. These included eight in the regional capital, also called Belgorod.
Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday it had taken control of the towns of Pivnichne and Vyimka, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. The Associated Press could not independently verify the claim.
Russian forces have been driving deeper into the partly occupied eastern region, the total capture of which is one of the Kremlin’s primary ambitions. Russia’s army is closing in on Pokrovsk, a critical logistics hub for the Ukrainian defense in the area.
At least three people were killed and nine wounded on Sunday in Russian shelling in the town of Kurakhove, some 20 miles (33 kilometers) south of Pokrovsk, Donetsk regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said.
Also on Sunday, 44 people were wounded when Russia attacked the Kharkiv regional capital, also called Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. The city was struck by 10 missiles, with a shopping center, a sports facility and residential buildings among those damaged. 
Elsewhere in Ukraine overnight, eight drones were shot down out of 11 launched by Russia, according to the Ukrainian air force.
One person was killed and four wounded in shelling overnight in the Sumy region, local officials said, while Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said five other people had been wounded in his region.

Publication date:2024-09-25 22:27:00

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — With the end of his life approaching, Missouri death row inmate Marcellus Williams was offered an opportunity to make a final statement to the world.
His words were few — neither proclaiming innocence nor admitting guilt in the 1998 murder of Lisha Gayle, a social worker and former St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter who was stabbed 43 times during a burglary of her suburban St. Louis home. Williams instead seemed to express peace with his fate, writing simply: “All Praise Be To Allah In Every Situation!!!”
Williams’ execution Tuesday has left others to debate whether it should have occurred.
Missouri’s governor, attorney general and top court remain convinced of his guilt. Those who advocated for him continue to insist he was innocent. The St. Louis County prosecutor, citing lingering questions, believes Williams’ sentence should have been converted to life in prison. Gayle’s family, though not publicly outspoken, also joined in a request to let Williams live. 
The Missouri execution, carried out at a prison in Bonne Terre, was one of five scheduled within a week in the U.S., renewing a long-running debate over how the death penalty is applied in the states. 
When Gayle was killed, items stolen from her home were later sold by Williams or found in his possession. A former girlfriend and an inmate who shared a cell with Williams also testified at his trial that he confessed to killing Gayle. 


The ex-girlfriend told police that when Williams picked her up on the day of the Gayle’s death, she noticed he was wearing a jacket even though it was hot outside, and that there was blood on his shirt, scratches on his neck and a laptop in his car. She told police that when she looked in the car’s trunk the next day, she found a purse that contained Gayle’s identification.
When police searched Williams’ car more than a year after Gayle’s death, they found a St. Louis Post-Dispatch ruler and calculator that had belonged to Gayle. Police also recovered a laptop stolen from Gayle’s home from a man who had bought it from Williams. 
Williams’ attorneys argued that the ex-girlfriend and cellmate were convicted felons who wanted part of a $10,000 reward. Williams’ former cellmate was paid a $5,000 reward. The ex-girlfriend never requested the reward, the governor’s office said.
Authorities did not find physical evidence at the crime scene linking Williams to Gayle’s death. 
Williams’ attorneys noted that a bloody shoeprint, fingerprints and hair found at the scene did not match Williams. But a prosecutor said such tests were merely inconclusive.
The knife used in the killing also was left at the scene. A crime scene investigator testified at Williams’ 2001 trial that the killer had worn gloves. But questions swirled for years about DNA testing of the knife. 
The state Supreme Court canceled Williams’ scheduled execution in 2015, allowing time for further DNA testing. Just hours before Williams was again scheduled to be executed in 2017, then-Gov. Eric Greitens also canceled the lethal injection amid DNA questions. Greitens appointed a board of retired judges to investigate the case. But the panel never reached a conclusion before Gov. Mike Parson dissolved it in 2023. 
In August, new testing revealed that DNA on the knife matched that of prosecution team members who had handled it without wearing gloves. Without evidence pointing to anyone else, Williams’ attorneys quit pursuing an innocence claim in court and refocused their arguments on alleged procedural errors, including that prosecutors had mishandled evidence and wrongly excluded a Black man from the jury based partly on race.
There have been no verified instances of an innocent person being executed in the U.S. since capital punishment was reintroduced in 1972, but there have been at least 21 people executed despite “strong and credible” claims of innocence, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The group said that tally includes Williams, who was added to the list Wednesday. 
The center’s list also includes two other Missouri men. They are Walter Barton, who was executed in May 2020 for the fatal stabbing of an 81-year-old woman, and Larry Griffith, who was executed in June 1995 for the fatal drive-by shooting of a 19-year-old man.
In addition, the center lists three current death row inmates facing execution despite strong claims of innocence: Richard Glossip, who was convicted in Oklahoma of a murder-for-hire of a motel owner; Toforest Johnson, who is set to die in Alabama for the murder of an off-duty sheriff’s deputy; and Robert Roberson, who was convicted in Texas of murdering his 2-year-old daughter.
At the time of Williams’ murder trial, he already had an extensive list of burglary, robbery, theft and assault convictions in other cases. A jury convicted him of first-degree murder for Gayle’s death, which in Missouri can be punishable either by death or life in prison without parole. It took jurors just 90 minutes to decide that he deserved the death penalty. 
St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell, a Democrat who took office in 2019 and is running for Congress, cited a relatively recent Missouri law to reopen the question of Williams’ guilt or innocence. Bell struck an agreement in August with the Midwest Innocence Project, which was representing Williams, that would have let Williams enter a new, no-contest plea to first-degree murder in exchange for a new sentence of life in prison without parole. 
Bell’s position made the case highly unusual, said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which reports on problems with capital punishment and has a database of nearly 1,600 executions. 
Maher said it’s “highly, highly unusual, very rare” for a prosecutor to side with a prisoner who is facing execution. 
But Republican Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey objected, and courts kept in place the death sentence. 
Ultimately, the execution decision rested with Parson, who could have used gubernatorial powers to convert Williams’ sentence to life imprisonment. 
A clemency request submitted on Williams’ behalf pleaded for mercy, noting that Gayle’s family also supported life imprisonment instead of death. But Parson disagreed, explaining in his own final statement on the case: “No juror nor judge has ever found Williams’s innocence claim to be credible.” 
The story has been corrected to fix the spelling of the Texas death row inmate’s last name. He is Robert Roberson, not Robertson.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential candidate, is less popular among voters than his Democratic rival, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 
Both Vance and Walz entered the spotlight this summer as relative political unknowns. As both running mates prepare to address a huge audience in next week’s vice-presidential debate, Democrats are more positive about Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris than Republicans are about Vance and former President Donald Trump.
The findings of the new survey reinforce the challenge for the Republican presidential ticket as voting begins in more and more states. 
The poll shows that negative feelings about Vance are considerably more widespread than positive opinions. About half of registered voters have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Vance, up from about 4 in 10 in late July, while around one-quarter have a somewhat or very favorable view of him, and a similar share don’t know enough to say. 
Walz, by contrast, is better liked. About 3 in 10 voters have a negative view of Walz, while about 4 in 10 have a positive opinion and about 3 in 10 don’t know enough to say.
That difference in favorability extends to the candidates’ bases. About 7 in 10 Democratic voters have a positive opinion of Walz, compared to about 6 in 10 Republican voters who have a favorable view of Vance.


Democratic candidates tend to receive more support from women, while Republicans perform better among men. That gap is clear in Trump and Harris’ favorability numbers — but Walz is better liked than Vance among both men and women.
About 4 in 10 male and female voters have a positive view of Walz, while about 3 in 10 men and about one-quarter of women have a positive view of Vance.
Walz also has a popularity advantage over Vance among voters over the age of 60. Half of voters in this group view Walz somewhat or very favorably, while about 3 in 10 have a similar opinion of Vance.
Despite his strength over Vance in some areas, there are also some key Democratic groups where Walz still has work to do. About three-quarters of Black adults have a favorable view of Harris, while roughly half say the same about Walz. She is also viewed more positively by women; about 3 in 10 women don’t know enough about Walz to have an opinion.
In general, though, neither of the vice-presidential candidates outshine Harris or Trump among major demographic groups, and they remain less well-known than the presidential nominees, even among groups that are traditionally part of each party’s base. For example, about one-quarter of white voters without a college degree don’t know enough to say about Vance, and around 4 in 10 voters between the ages of 18 and 29 don’t have an opinion on Walz. 
This means their popularity could continue to shift as their national profiles rise. 
The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted Sept. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.",True

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are off to a 3-1 start with a lot of room for improvement.
That was coach Todd Bowles’ message in the aftermath of a 33-16 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles that left the Bucs in a familiar position — sole possession of first place in the NFC South. With a short week to prepare for Thursday night’s game at division rival Atlanta, the team’s next challenge may be the toughest it’s had so far.
“Really just taking care of their bodies and staying healthy and making sure they’re ready to go,” Bowles said. “Getting treatment when you need to get treatment and getting rest when you need to get rest.”
That figures to leave players little time to pat themselves on the back for what they accomplished in September, and especially how they rebounded with perhaps their best all-around performance of the season against the Eagles after playing poorly in a 26-7 loss to Denver the previous week.
The offense gained 445 yards and scored on four of six possessions in the red zone. The defense limited the Eagles to 227 yards and sacked Jalen Hurts six times after only getting opposing quarterbacks on the ground twice in the first three weeks of the season.
“(We’ve) taken ownership of what we put on tape (against the Broncos). ... Everybody owned it, and that’s an accountable team,” Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield said.
Bowles said overall, it’s a nice start to the season. Still, there’s a lot of work left, beginning with back-to-back games against the Falcons and Saints.


“It’s definitely a huge opportunity for us, but we can only take it one game at a time, right?” receiver Chris Godwin said.

“We for sure cannot be looking past anybody, let alone one of our division rivals that presents a really big challenge for us,” Godwin added. "". It’s going to be a big game for us, especially on a short week. We’ve got to make sure that we’re on our P’s and Q’s in the film room and in our game plan to be able to go in there into a hostile environment. I’m sure their stadium will be rocking. It’s going to be a tough challenge for us, but I think we’re up to the task.”
Mayfield passed for two touchdowns and ran for a third against the Eagles. The offense scored touchdowns on its first two possessions — a rarity for Tampa Bay. In fact, the Bucs had gone 20 consecutive games without getting into the end zone on their opening drive.
The running game is not nearly as productive as it needs to be if the Bucs are going to be as good as they think they can be. Rookie Bucky Irving scored his first pro TD and finished with 49 yards on 10 carries. Starter Rachaad White also rushed for 49 yards on 10 attempts, but the ground game has been inconsistent at best.
Sterling Shepard had three receptions for 51 yards in his Bucs debut. The former New York Giants receiver was signed during the training camp, but got injured and never really had an opportunity to compete for a job. The Bucs brought him back on the practice squad and promoted to the active roster for Sunday’s game.
“He’s very smart, he brings a lot of experience, he can still play ... he’s very fast, he’s very sure-handed,” Bowles said. “If he’s healthy, he’s a heck of a football player.”
Punter Jake Camarda was a healthy scratch after Trenton Gill was signed earlier in the week.
A total of 15 players were listed on the injury report Monday, but Bowles said it was too soon to speculate on who might not play this week. All-Pro safety Antoine Winfield (foot), DL Calijah Kancey (calf) and RT Luke Goedeke were all inactive against the Eagles.
596. WR Mike Evans became the Bucs’ career scoring leader, surpassing Martin Gramatica (592) and becoming only the third non-kicker to lead a franchise in scoring. The others are Hall of Famers Jerry Rice (49ers) and Emmitt Smith (Cowboys).
Thursday night begins a two-game stretch against NFC South rivals. After facing the Falcons, the Bucs travel to New Orleans on Oct. 13.

DirecTV is buying Dish and Sling, a deal it has sought to complete for years, as the company seeks to better compete against streaming services that have become dominant.
DirecTV said Monday that it will acquire Dish TV and Sling TV from its owner EchoStar in a debt exchange transaction that includes a payment of $1, plus the assumption of approximately $9.8 billion in debt. 
The prospect of a DirecTV-Dish combo has long been rumored, with headlines about reported talks popping up over the years. And the two almost merged more than two decades ago — but the Federal Communications Commission blocked their owners’ then-$18.5 billion deal, citing antitrust concerns.
The pay-for-TV market has shifted significantly since. As more and more consumers tune into online streaming giants, demand for more traditional satellite continues to shrink. And, although high-profile acquisitions have proven to be particularly tough under the Biden-Harris administration, that may make regulators more inclined to approve DirecTV and Dish’s pairing this time around.
DirecTV said Monday that the transaction will help it bring smaller content packages to consumer at lower prices and essentially provide a one-stop shopping experience for entertainment programming. 
It’s hoping this will appeal to those who have left satellite video services for streaming. The company said that combined, DirecTV and Dish have collectively lost 63% of their satellite customers since 2016.


“DirecTV operates in a highly competitive video distribution industry,” DirecTV CEO Bill Morrow said in a statement. “With greater scale, we expect a combined DirecTV and Dish will be better able to work with programmers to realize our vision for the future of tv, which is to aggregate, curate, and distribute content tailored to customers’ interests, and to be better positioned to realize operating efficiencies while creating value for customers through additional investment.”
The current deal could provide a key lifeline for EchoStar. The Colorado-based telecommunications company has reportedly faced the prospect of bankruptcy as it continues to burn through cash and see losses pile up.
In a recent securities filing, EchoStar disclosed that it had just $521 million in “cash on hand.” And the company forecast negative cash flows for the remainder of the year — while also pointing to major looming debt payments, with more than $1.98 billion of debt set to mature in November.
“With an improved financial profile, we will be better positioned to continue enhancing and deploying our nationwide 5G Open RAN wireless network,” EchoStar President and CEO Hamid Akhavan said. “This will provide U.S. wireless consumers with more choices and help to drive innovation at a faster pace.” 
By shedding Dish, EchoStar will be able to focus its efforts elsewhere, like its wireless carrier Boost Mobile.
“We are playing to win in the wireless business. there’s no doubt about it,” Akhavan said during a conference call, adding that the company may need to seek additional funding and financing in the future to achieve its goals.
Shares of EchoStar fell more than 14% in Monday midday trading. 
The DirecTV and Dish deal is targeted to close in 2025’s fourth quarter. But it is contingent on several factors, including regulatory approvals and bondholders writing off nearly $1.6 billion in debt related to Dish. 
The combined company will be based in El Segundo, California. 
“We believe regulatory approval is likely to be greater than 50% given the opportunity for the combined company to improve its competitiveness to offer a range of linear video packages as well as to take a more aggressive stance on offering a live streaming video product,” Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research wrote in a note to clients.
But the analyst added that there’s still significant uncertainty related to whether or not the Federal Communications Commission, Department of Justice and other possible regulators give the necessary approvals, based on previous talks with company management and industry experts over the last few years.
Shortly before DirecTV made its announcement, AT&T said it was selling its remaining stake in DirecTV to private equity firm TPG in a deal valued at about $7.6 billion. 
The move ends the communication giant’s remaining ties to the entertainment industry.
AT&T said Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will receive payments from TPG and DirecTV for its remaining 70% stake in the satellite TV company. This includes $1.7 billion in the second half of the year and $5.4 billion next year. The remaining amount will be paid in 2029.
AT&T purchased DirectTV for $48.5 billion back in 2015. But in 2021, following the loss of millions of customers, AT&T sold a 30% stake of the business to TPG for $16.25 billion.
AT&T’s deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025.",False

GRAND HAVEN, Mich. (AP) — An ultra swimmer nicknamed The Shark was back on shore Wednesday, having given up on yet another quest to cross Lake Michigan after 40 hours in the water.
An online tracker showed Jim Dreyer returned to Grand Haven, Michigan, where he started his planned 82-mile (130-kilometer) swim to Wisconsin on Monday night.
He posted on Facebook that he was safe.
“There were only two good hours in this 40-hour swim. If you were watching the tracker, I promise I wasn’t drunk,” Dreyer wrote. “We will talk after a sleep Marathon. Thank you all for your support, Your Love, and prayers.”
Dreyer, 61, has tried four times since 2023 to swim across Lake Michigan, including an effort just a few weeks ago, but has been unsuccessful due to lake conditions or other factors.
He was not only swimming one of the Great Lakes this week but also towing a small inflatable boat with supplies.
Dreyer first made a splash when he crossed Lake Michigan in 1998, starting in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, and finishing in Ludington, Michigan.
In August, lake conditions and hallucinations forced him to give up on the third day. Dreyer lost the batteries for his GPS device and ended up swimming far off course.

PHOENIX (AP) — Kyle Higashioka, Brandon Lockridge and Donovan Solano homered in the ninth inning, lifting the San Diego Padres to a 5-0 win on Saturday night over the sliding Arizona Diamondbacks, who continued to lose ground in the National League playoff race.
The Diamondbacks (88-73) have lost five of six as they chase an NL wild card. They’re currently behind the Braves (88-71) and Mets (87-72), who hold the final two playoff spots.
“It was just one of those nights,” Diamondbacks first baseman Christian Walker said. “They executed well. You’ve got to tip you’re hat, even if it’s frustrating to say. There’s two sides of it. Somebody else is doing their job when they’re getting you out.
“We had some opportunities, but couldn’t execute when it mattered.”
The game was scoreless heading into the ninth. With one out, San Diego’s David Peralta singled up the middle and then Higashioka cranked a no-doubt, two-run homer deep into the left field stands. 
“I was just looking for something down the middle and the slider kind of popped on him,” Higashioka said. “I recognized it early and luckily this one went over the fence.”
Lockridge followed with his first big league homer, which was also hit to left.
It was a stunning blowup for Diamondbacks left-hander A.J. Puk (4-9), who has been the team’s most dominant reliever since he was acquired from the Miami Marlins at the trade deadline. He had given up just one run over 27 innings over his 29 outings since coming to Arizona.


“They both hit sliders,” Puk said. “It’s one of those things. They put some good swings on the ball, they’re good hitters. It wasn’t my day today.”
Solano added a two-run homer, his fourth hit of the night, later in the ninth off Scott McGough for a 5-0 advantage. 
“This game can be awesome, and it can rip your heart out,” Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. 
Arizona has the highest-scoring offense in the big leagues this season but finished with just two hits. San Diego right-hander Randy Vásquez took a no-hitter into the sixth inning before Corbin Carroll laced a double to right field. 
The 25-year-old Vásquez — who had just been recalled from Triple-A El Paso — was making his first start in the big leagues since Aug. 31. He finished with six scoreless innings, giving up just one hit and one walk while striking out four.
The Padres rested several regulars for Saturday’s game after securing the No. 4 spot in the NL playoff bracket on Friday. San Diego will host a best-of-three Wild Card Series starting Tuesday.
“Regardless of who we put out there, they’re going to compete and play to win the game,” Padres manager Mike Shildt said. “It started with Vásquez, he was fantastic.”
San Diego’s Luis Arraez (.314) got the day off as he tries to hold off Shohei Ohtani and Marcell Ozuna for the NL batting title. If he wins, it would be his third batting crown in three years for three different teams, which hasn’t been done in the post-1900 era.
Diamondbacks lefty Eduardo Rodriguez started with 4 2/3 scoreless innings, giving up four hits and two walks while striking out three.
San Diego’s Wandy Peralta (3-2) threw a scoreless eighth to earn the win.
Shildt told reporters that INF Ha-Seong Kim will not return this season because of a shoulder injury. He hit .233 with 11 homers and 22 stolen bases over 122 games.
The teams wrap up the regular season on Sunday. The Padres will start LHP Martín Pérez (5-5, 4.25 ERA) while the Diamondbacks haven’t announced a starter.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The race for control of Congress is as close as ever, with barely two dozen House seats and a handful in the Senate likely to determine the majority this November and whether a single party sweeps to power with the White House.
Lawmakers are returning to Washington for a three-week legislative sprint, away from the campaign trail where races have become “trench warfare” and a seat-by-seat slog. Many of the highest-profile races are being waged in Montana, New York, California and beyond, far from the presidential battleground states contested by Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.
“Buckle up,” said Jack Pandol, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
Upended by the summer shake-up that replaced President Joe Biden with Harris atop the Democratic ticket, the down-ballot campaigns enter this fall stretch at a virtual toss-up, a high-wire uncertainty where every single seat won or lost could make the difference in party control.
What’s changed is not so much the fundamentals of the individual races, but which side has the energy and enthusiasm to make sure their voters actually show up and cast their ballots, strategists said.
Money, volunteers and voter enthusiasm are flowing to the Democratic campaigns since Harris replaced Biden. That’s challenging Republicans who entered the election cycle favored for gains and buoyed by Trump’s comeback bid, despite the criminal charges hanging over his potential return to the White House.


Trump and Republicans are working feverishly to regain the momentum they enjoyed from the GOP convention in Milwaukee and from the Supreme Court decision giving former presidents broad immunity from prosecution, including for some acts related to his effort to overturn the 2020 election and for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
Trump’s campaign staff held a private conference call Friday with House Republicans, assuring them that the movement is shifting to Trump as they game out strategies ahead, according to another Republican who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed conversation.
“There’s a lot of handwringing going on and a lot of anxiousness about where this election is headed,” said Montana Sen. Steve Daines, a Trump ally who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm.
Speaking at the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas, Daines played up GOP Senate candidates as warriors and predicted that enthusiasm from rural voters who will “crawl over broken glass” to vote for Trump will help Republicans such as Sam Brown, who is challenging Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev.
Still, the fundraising gap Republicans now find themselves facing with Democrats is a problem, say GOP strategists on both ends of the Capitol, leaving them without money to keep pace with advertising and on-the-ground organizing.
“We have a lot of work to do,” Daines said.
Long gone are the days of supermajorities in the House and Senate, replaced by a new era of razor-thin margins that leave little margin for errors in political campaigns, or actual governing. 
Democrats are almost certain to see their narrow majority slip to at least a 50-50 split with Republicans with the retirement of independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. His departure is making way for Republican Gov. Jim Justice to handily win that seat.
What to know about the 2024 Election
Trump is wildly popular in Montana, where Senate Republicans see their best chance to go on offense as they challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. But Tester is also a popular figure in the Big Sky state, where a whopping $238 million-plus is being spent on ads.
Senate Republicans had the advantage this this cycle, with few incumbents to protect, allowing them to challenge Democrats with handpicked, often wealthy recruits in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin. Democrats have only more recently gone on offense in long-shot races against Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida.
But incumbents often bring longevity and name recognition to the race, making them tough to topple, as is the case in Pennsylvania, where Democrat Sen. Bob Casey is being challenged by Republican Dave McCormick, and in Ohio, where Sen. Sherrod Brown is running a playful cookie-eating television ad as he faces Republican Bernie Moreno.
For the open seat in Democratic-heavy Maryland, the state’s popular former Republican governor, Larry Hogan, who was courted to run by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, is in a tough matchup against county executive Angela Alsobrooks. She would make history as one of the few Black women elected to the Senate.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has predicted Democrats will keep their majority. In a Senate split, majority control goes to the party in the White House because the vice president can cast deciding votes.
“Democrats have never been in a stronger position to defend our Senate majority,” said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who leads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has crisscrossed the country this summer in some 20 states as what he calls an “ambassador of hope” in his party’s quest to save its razor-thin majority. 
The Republicans are trying to protect 18 Republicans in Democratic-heavy congressional districts where Biden had won, particularly in coastal New York and California, and going on offense to challenge Democrats elsewhere.
But House Democrats, whose campaign chairwoman, Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state was among those who spoke privately to Biden about the potential down-ballot drag as he weighed his decision to exit the race, are benefiting from the Harris momentum.
Democrats are working to protect their own most embattled House lawmakers, a handful of pragmatic legislators including Marcy Kaptur in Ohio, Matt Cartwright in Pennsylvania and a trio of younger lawmakers who lead the centrist Blue Dog coalition — Mary Peltola of Alaska, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state and Jared Golden of Maine.
Each faces a notable Republican: Nick Begich, from an Alaskan political family; Washington’s Trump-endorsed Joe Kent; and former NASCAR driver Austin Theriault in Maine.
Republicans have gone to great lengths to diversify their own ranks of what just a few years ago, remained a party of mostly white men, and few women. The 2018 election, for example, left about a about a dozen Republican women and no Black Republicans in the House.
GOP Rep. Richard Hudson, chairman of the NRCC, said House Republicans are “right where we expected to be,” acknowledging it’s a “trench warfare” fight.
Because many of the House races are being contested so far from the presidential battlegrounds, candidates are being forced to stand up their own operations along with the congressional committees to turn out the vote. 
House Democrats are seeing an organic flow of volunteers mobilized, having knocked on more than 377,000 doors and made more than 845,000 phone calls in August, greater than in the previous three months combined, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said.
House Republicans have propped up dozens of “Battle Stations” for voter outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, particularly areas without Trump’s campaign infrastructure, and also report crowds of enthusiastic voters at events as Johnson traveled the country in the contested regions. 
Fundraising remains imbalanced as Democrats are outpacing Republicans with Harris atop the ticket, and Republicans are sounding alarms to their own donors to get off the sidelines.
“We are on track to flip the Senate,” said Jason Thielman, executive director of the NRSC. But he said the Democrats’ “massive cash advantage is a real problem. The biggest thing preventing Senate Republicans from having a great night in November is the cash crunch.”
Both the DSCC and DSCC posted record online fundraising in the days after Harris’ campaign announcement and her team sent $25 million to down-ballot races, including $10 million each this past week to the House and Senate committees.
DCCC Spokesperson Viet Shelton said grassroots enthusiasm to elect a Democratic House majority is “at an all-time high.” He said voters want to elect “get-stuff-done incumbents” not a “rag-tag group” of Republican candidates aligned with Trump.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Palestinian militants killed three Israeli police officers on Sunday when they opened fire on a vehicle in the occupied West Bank, where Israel has carried out large-scale raids in recent days.
The attack took place along a road in the southern West Bank. The raids have mainly been focused on urban refugee camps in the northern part of the territory, where Israeli forces have traded fire with militants on a near-daily basis since the outbreak of the war in Gaza.
The police confirmed that all three killed were officers and said the assailants slipped away. 
One of the officers killed was Roni Shakuri, 61, from the southern town of Sderot near the Gaza border, police said. His daughter, Mor, who was also a police officer, was killed in a battle with Hamas militants when they tried to take over the Sderot police station during the Oct. 7 attack.
A little-known militant group calling itself the Khalil al-Rahman Brigade claimed responsibility for the shooting on Sunday. Hamas praised the attack as a “natural response” to the war in Gaza and called for more.
Later on Sunday, Israeli forces encircled a home in the nearby city of Hebron where the army said the suspected attacker was believed to be hiding. At least six soldiers moved in on the structure, repeatedly opening fire and tossing a grenade inside. Soldiers later removed the body of a man from inside on a stretcher, at one point turning toward Palestinian journalists and firing several rounds toward them. 
The army later said the dead man was the gunman from the morning attack, and that an M-16 automatic rifle was found with him. It said the man had formerly served in the Palestinian Authority’s security forces.


The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there.
Over 650 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, mainly during Israeli military arrest raids. Most appear to have been militants involved in gunbattles with Israeli forces, but civilian bystanders and rock-throwing protesters have also been killed.
The last 10 months have also seen an uptick in settler violence directed at Palestinians and in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.
Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state, but the last serious peace talks collapsed more than 15 years ago. 
Israel has built well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, some of which resemble suburbs and small towns, Over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship live in the settlements, which most of the international community considers illegal.
The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in population centers.

Baltimore Ravens linebacker Kyle Van Noy criticized the Kansas City Chiefs’ medical staff for being slow to respond to his eye injury during the teams’ season opener last week.
Van Noy injured his right eye in the third quarter on Thursday night and said he was “disappointed” about how long it took for Chiefs doctors to see him in the locker room after leaving the field.
“When you get hurt, especially something that can be serious like mine was, you’re supposed to rely on the team’s training staff or their doctors, and I was supposed to see an ophthalmologist,” Van Noy said Tuesday on his podcast with retired defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. “They took an entire quarter to get down to talk to me in the locker room, which to me is unacceptable because then you start thinking, ’What if I was trying to go back in the game? What if I was really, really hurt? I know mine happened to be moderate, but it still was serious because it’s an eye and your expectation of someone to be down there, as the training staff asked them to be down there, would have had a little bit more urgency.”
A Chiefs spokesperson said the team had no comment on Van Noy’s remarks, which also referenced the organization getting a failing grade for its training staff on NFLPA report cards.
“I understand how Kansas City, the players have given that training room an ‘F’ because, with my experience, I would have probably after that gave them an ‘F,’ too,” Van Noy said. “As a player, people have that expectation of you being professional, handling business and in a time of need I wanted that from them and I felt like I didn’t get it.”


In July, shortly before training camp, Chiefs president Mark Donovan was asked about the “F” grades from players.

“You hate to see that, and you hate to be on the other side of that,” Donovan said at the time. “You do have to throw open your eyes to it and listen, so you learn from it. One thing that I think is important that probably isn’t as well known is we met with our (player) leadership team and walked through it and said, ‘What’s real and what’s not?’ We had a great meeting. It’s a smaller group of players, but it’s the leaders of the team.”
Van Noy, 33, is in his 11th NFL season and third with Baltimore. His thoughts drifted to wondering if the delay was because he played for the Ravens but said he did not believe that to be the case.
“I don’t think it was that, but at the same time I don’t want them to come out and apologize,” Van Noy said while wearing sunglasses. “It is what it is. It’s all good. I don’t need them to come out with a press release and say they apologize, ‘We take care of our players,’ blah, blah, blah, but I experienced it.”
Van Noy did not practice Wednesday. Coach John Harbaugh said it was a situation he was not getting involved in.
“I don’t know what happened or didn’t happen,” Harbaugh told reporters in Owings Mills, Maryland. “I have respect for everybody involved. I have respect for the medical people everywhere in the league, of course. Our place, Kansas City, every place in the league, all of them have the utmost respect for the players. Certainly Kyle Van Noy, he’s my guy. I love him. This is one of these guys that competes and fights and does everything he can to be the best player he can.”

Publication date:2024-09-12 07:00:00

NAPA, Calif. (AP) — David Lipsky shot a 7-under 65 on Thursday at Silverado Country Club to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Procore Championship.
Winless in 104 events since joining the PGA Tour in 2022, Lipsky went out with the early groups and had eight birdies with one bogey to kick off the FedEx Cup Fall series at the picturesque course in the heart of Napa Valley wine country.
After missing the cut in his three previous tournaments, Lipsky flew from Las Vegas to Arizona to reunite with his college coach at Northwestern to get his focus back. He also spent time playing with some of the Northwestern players, which helped him relax.
“Just being around those guys and seeing how carefree they are, not knowing what’s coming for them yet, it’s sort of nice to see that,” Lipsky said. “I was almost energized by their youthfulness.”
Patton Kizzire and Mark Hubbard were a stroke back. Kizzire started on the back nine and made a late run with three consecutive birdies to move into a tie for first. A bogey on No. 8 dropped him back.
“There was a lot of good stuff out there today,” Kizzire said. “I stayed patient and just went through my routines and played well, one shot at a time. I’ve really bee working hard on my mental game and I think that allowed me to rinse and repeat and reset and keep playing.”
Mark Hubbard was at 67. He had nine birdies but fell off the pace with a bogey and triple bogey on back-to-back holes.


Kevin Dougherty also was in the group at 67. He had two eagles and ended his afternoon by holing out from 41 yards on the 383-yard, par-4 18th.
Defending champion Sahith Theegala had to scramble for much of his round of 69.
Wyndham Clark, who won the U.S. Open in 2023 and the AT&T at Pebble Beach in February, had a 70.
Max Homa shot 71. The two-time tournament champion and a captain’s pick for the President’s Cup in two weeks had two birdies and overcame a bogey on the par-4 first.
Stewart Cink, the 2020 winner, also opened with a 71. He won The Ally Challenge last month for his first PGA Tour Champions title.
Three players from the Presidents Cup International team had mix results. Min Woo Lee shot 68, Mackenzie Hughes 69 and Corey Conners 73. International team captain Mike Weir also had a 69.
Lipsky was a little shaky off the tee for much of the afternoon but made up for it with steady iron play that left him in great shape on the greens. He had one-putts on 11 holes and was in position for a bigger day but left five putts short.
Lipsky’s only real problem came on the par-4 ninth when his approach sailed into a bunker just shy of the green. He bounced back nicely with five birdies on his back nine. After missing a 19-foot putt for birdie on No. 17, Lipsky ended his day with a 12-foot par putt.
That was a big change from last year when Lipsky tied for 30th at Silverado when he drove the ball well but had uneven success on the greens.
“Sometimes you have to realize golf can be fun, and I think I sort of forgot that along the way as I’m grinding it out,” Lipsky said. “You’ve got to put things in perspective, take a step back. Sort of did that and it seems like it’s working out.”
Laird stayed close after beginning his day with a bogey on the par-4 10th. The Scot got out of the sand nicely but pushed his par putt past the hole.
Homa continued to have issues off the tee and missed birdie putts on his final four holes.

Pro Picks is a weekly column where AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi shares his picks for upcoming games. For all previous Pro Picks, head here.
Five home underdogs, a winless favorite and three undefeated underdogs highlight the NFL’s Week 4 schedule.
The Bills, Vikings and Seahawks are among five 3-0 teams but they’re road dogs this weekend. The Bengals are 0-3 but they’re road favorites.
Home field isn’t an odds advantage for the Giants, Colts, Buccaneers, Panthers and Chargers.
Oddsmakers are still trying to figure teams out in September, giving respect to some based on last year’s success and waiting for others to earn more trust.
Pro Picks aims for a fourth straight winning week.
Line: Bengals minus 4
Andy Dalton and the Panthers (1-2) are getting no respect after the veteran quarterback excelled in his first start, leading Carolina to its first victory. Joe Burrow and the Bengals (0-3) are reeling. They can’t afford another loss with their playoff hopes already on the ropes. Expect Joe Cool to come out slinging.
BEST BET: BENGALS: 27-13 
Line: Packers minus 2 1/2
Malik Willis has led the Packers (2-1) to two straight wins without Jordan Love thanks to the best rushing attack in the NFL at 204 yards per game and an opportunistic defense. The Vikings (3-0) are coming off back-to-back impressive wins over San Francisco and Houston and Sam Darnold is thriving. Minnesota’s defense presents a tough challenge for Willis or Love, if he returns from a knee injury. The Vikings are 6-1-2 against the spread in their past nine road games. The Packers are 5-1 against the spread in their past six home games. Something has to give.
UPSET SPECIAL: VIKINGS: 24-23 


Line: Cowboys minus 5 1/2
The AP Top 25 college football poll is back every week throughout the season!
Get the poll delivered straight to your inbox with AP Top 25 Poll Alerts. Sign up here.
Dallas (1-2) can’t stop the run or run the ball. The Cowboys are fortunate to be facing the Giants (1-2) on Thursday night. Daniel Jones has played better this season but a motivated Micah Parsons should make his night difficult. The Cowboys have won six in a row in the series, 13 of 14 and outscored New York 89-17 last season. Dak Prescott has won his past 12 starts vs. the Giants.
COWBOYS: 27-17 
Line: Falcons minus 2 1/2
Kirk Cousins was a missed call away from leading the Falcons (1-2) to a comeback win against the two-time defending champion Chiefs. Derek Carr and the Saints (2-1) struggled against Philadelphia after two dominant performances. New Orleans has won five of the past six games in Atlanta. But this is a revamped Falcons team with Cousins, playmakers and a strong defense.
FALCONS: 23-20 
Line: Bears minus 3
The Bears (1-2) need to run the ball better to help Caleb Williams and the offensive line must protect him. He should have success facing the league’s worst defense. The Rams (1-2) have allowed the most yards (425.7 per game) this season. Matthew Stafford, despite a depleted supporting cast, should keep Los Angeles close.
BEARS: 23-19 
Line: Steelers minus 1 1/2
No team wins more games playing old-school football than the Steelers (3-0). They run the ball, have a tenacious defense and Justin Fields is making enough plays without mistakes. The Colts (1-2) could learn from Pittsburgh. Anthony Richardson has only completed 49.6% of his passes this season and had five picks in the past two games. That spells doom against T.J. Watt and the Steelers.
STEELERS: 19-16 
Line: Jets minus 7 1/2
Aaron Rodgers is back to playing like a four-time MVP and the Jets (2-1) seem to just be getting started. He’ll face a stout Broncos defense this week. Bo Nix is coming off his best game, though he faced an injury-depleted defense in Tampa Bay. He still hasn’t thrown a TD pass. The point spread seems too big, making New York the play.
JETS: 26-13 
Line: Eagles minus 2
The Eagles (2-1) could be without starting wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. The Buccaneers (2-1) are banged-up on defense without All-Pro safety Antoine Winfield Jr., though they’re hoping defensive tackles Vita Vea and Calijah Kancey can return. It’s revenge game for Philadelphia after an embarrassing loss to Tampa Bay in a wild-card game last postseason.
EAGLES: 25-20 
Line: Texans minus 6 1/2
Trevor Lawrence has regressed and the Jaguars (0-3) are in trouble after entering the season with high expectations. C.J. Stroud and the Texans (2-1) aim to rebound from a disappointing loss. Houston has dominated the series, winning 10 of the past 12 meetings. Jacksonville is desperate enough to stay close but hard to see an upset after a listless effort in Buffalo.
TEXANS: 23-22 
Line: Cardinals minus 3 1/2
Kyler Murray could have a big day throwing to Marvin Harrison Jr. against a pass defense that’s ranked 29th. It would help him if the Cardinals (1-2) could run the ball more effectively. Jayden Daniels has been impressive for the Commanders (2-1) and this game probably means a little more to offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, who was Arizona’s coach. Still, it’ll be hard for Washington to win on the road on a short week after a road win Monday night.
CARDINALS: 26-20 
Line: 49ers minus 10 1/2
The Super Bowl hangover is real. The 49ers (1-2) keep losing star players and games despite Brock Purdy’s best efforts. Somehow, they’re double-digit favorites against the rested Patriots (1-2). This is another game where a big line makes the home team the pick to cover the spread.
49ERS: 27-13 
Line: Raiders minus 2
The Browns (1-2) have too much talent to keep losing games. Myles Garrett is playing through injuries and his presence is enough to cause Gardner Minshew nightmares.
BROWNS: 22-16 
Line: Chiefs minus 7 1/2
Justin Herbert’s status is uncertain because of an ankle injury. With him, the Chargers (2-1) should be competitive. Without him, Taylor Heinicke will have to rely on a strong run game. Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs (3-0) are unbeaten despite playing inconsistent ball. Jim Harbaugh’s first crack at the two-time defending Super Bowl champions is spoiled by Herbert’s uncertainty and the absence of suspended safety Derwin James.
CHIEFS: 27-17 
Line: Ravens minus 2 1/2
Josh Allen has been outstanding in leading the Bills (3-0) to a hot start. The Ravens (1-2) saved their season in Dallas and need Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry to get rolling on the ground, control the clock and keep Allen and Co. off the field.
RAVENS: 26-23 
Line: Dolphins minus 1
Tua Tagovailoa’s absence has turned the Dolphins (1-2) from a contender to a pretender. Whether it’s Skylar Thompson, Tim Boyle or Tyler Huntley under center, Miami has to get the ball to a star-studded cast of playmakers. The Titans (0-3) are going through growing pains and should offer the Dolphins relief.
DOLPHINS: 20-17 
Line: Lions minus 3 1/2
Geno Smith and the unbeaten Seahawks (3-0) face their toughest challenge so far after beating the Broncos, Patriots and Dolphins. The Lions (2-1) have injury problems on defense and Jared Goff hasn’t been able to get the downfield passing game going. But the running game behind David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs is capable of carrying the offense until Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown and the receivers start clicking.
Last week: Straight up: 9-7. Against spread: 11-5
Overall: Straight up: 32-16. Against spread: 28-18-2
Thursday: Straight up: 2-1. Against spread: 2-1.
Monday: Straight up: 2-2. Against spread: 2-2.
Best Bet: Straight up: 2-1. Against spread: 2-1.
Upset Special: Straight up: 3-0. Against spread: 3-0.

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — State and local election officials from across the country on Wednesday warned that problems with the nation’s mail delivery system threaten to disenfranchise voters in the upcoming presidential election, telling the head of the U.S. Postal Service that it hasn’t fixed persistent deficiencies.
In an alarming letter, the officials said that over the past year, including the just-concluded primary season, mailed ballots that were postmarked on time were received by local election offices days after the deadline to be counted. They also noted that properly addressed election mail was being returned to them as undeliverable, a problem that could automatically send voters to inactive status through no fault of their own, potentially creating chaos when those voters show up to cast a ballot.
The officials also said that repeated outreach to the Postal Service to resolve the issues had failed and that the widespread nature of the problems made it clear these were “not one-off mistakes or a problem with specific facilities. Instead, it demonstrates a pervasive lack of understanding and enforcement of USPS policies among its employees.”
The letter to U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy came from two groups that represent top election administrators in all 50 states. They told DeJoy, “We have not seen improvement or concerted efforts to remediate our concerns.”
“We implore you to take immediate and tangible corrective action to address the ongoing performance issues with USPS election mail service,” they added. “Failure to do so will risk limiting voter participation and trust in the election process.”


The Postal Service on Wednesday reiterated DeJoy’s assurances that it’s well positioned to swiftly deliver election mail despite being in the midst of a network modernization that has caused some delivery hiccups. Mail is currently being delivered in 2.7 days on average, officials said, but the Postal Service is still urging voters not to procrastinate.
“We are ready to deliver. We were successful in 2020 delivering a historic volume of mail in ballots; also in 2022 and will do so again in November 2024,” Adrienne Marshall, director of Election Mail and Government Services, said in a statement.
The two groups, the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of State Election Directors, said local election officials “in nearly every state” are receiving timely postmarked ballots after Election Day and outside the three to five business days USPS claims as the standard for first-class mail.
The letter comes less than two weeks after DeJoy said in an interview that the Postal Service was ready to handle a flood of mail ballots expected as part of this November’s presidential election and as former President Donald Trump continues to sow doubts about U.S. elections by falsely claiming he won in 2020. 
That year, amid the global pandemic, election officials reported sending just over 69 million ballots in the mail, a substantial increase from four years earlier. 
While it’s likely that number will be smaller now, many voters have embraced mail voting and come to rely on it. And both Democrats and Republicans have launched efforts to push supporters to vote early, either in person or by mail to “bank” their votes before Election Day on Nov. 5.
What to know about the 2024 Election
The letter went out on the day the first mailed ballots of this year’s general election were being sent, to absentee voters in Alabama.
Postal Service officials told reporters last month that almost 98% of ballots were returned to election officials within three days in 2020, and in 2022, the figure was nearly 99%. DeJoy said he would like to inch closer to 100% this election cycle and that the Postal Service is better positioned to handle ballots than four years ago.
But officials in rural states have been critical of the Postal Service for years as it has consolidated mail-processing centers to cut its costs and financial losses.
In addition to being signed by the current and incoming presidents for both groups of election officials, the leaders of groups that represent local election officials in 25 states were listed. 
The election officials warned that any election mail returned to an election office as undeliverable could trigger a process outlined in federal law for maintaining accurate lists of registered voters. That means a voter could be moved to “inactive” status and be required to take additional action to verify their address to participate in the election, the officials said in the letter.
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, the recent past president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, sent his own letter in recent days to DeJoy. He said nearly 1,000 ballots from his state’s Aug. 6 primary election couldn’t be counted because they arrived too late or without postmarks — and more continue to come in.
“The Pony Express is more efficient at this point,” Schwab posted on the social media platform X in late August.
Schwab and other Kansas election officials also have said some ballots arrive on time but without postmarks, which keeps them from being counted under Kansas law. What’s more, Schwab told DeJoy, local postal clerks have told election officials that they can’t add postmarks later even if it’s clear that the Postal Service handled the ballot ahead of the mail-in deadline.
Kansas will count ballots postmarked on or before Election Day if they arrive within three days. The Republican-controlled Legislature created that grace period in 2017 over concerns that mail delivery had slowed after the Postal Service shut down seven mail-processing centers in the state. That left much of the state’s mail handled through larger centers in Denver, Amarillo, Texas, and Kansas City, Missouri.
Schwab has promoted the use of local ballot drop boxes for voting in advance, breaking with other Republicans who have suggested without evidence that they can be sources of fraud. Schwab has long said the boxes are more secure than the U.S. mail.
“Keep your ballot out of the hands of the federal government!” he advised voters in a post on X after the August primary.
In their letter Wednesday, election officials said colleagues across the U.S. have reported that Postal Service staff, from managers to mail carriers, are uninformed about the service’s policies for handling election-related mail, give them inconsistent guidance and misdeliver ballots.
“There is no amount of proactive communication election officials can do to account for USPS’s inability to meet their own service delivery timelines,” the officials wrote. “State and local election officials need a committed partner in USPS.”

Publication date:2024-09-02 07:00:00

United States President Joe Biden is adding to the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he isn’t doing enough to reach a cease-fire deal in Gaza.
Israel’s largest trade union, the Histadrut, called for the general strike, the first since the start of the war. It aimed to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking, health care and the country’s main airport. But a court ruled it had to end early after the government called the strike politically motivated. 
Hundreds of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets Sunday in grief and anger after six hostages were found dead in Gaza. The families and much of the public blamed Netanyahu, saying they could have been returned alive in a deal with Hamas to end the nearly 11-month-old war.
But others support Netanyahu’s strategy of maintaining military pressure on Hamas, whose Oct. 7 attack into Israel triggered the war. They say it will force the militants to give in to Israeli demands and ultimately annihilate the group.
Here’s the latest:
WASHINGTON — United States President Joe Biden again spoke briefly to reporters, this time as he departed the White House on Monday for a campaign stop with Vice President Kamala Harris in Pittsburgh.
Asked about progress toward a cease-fire, Biden responded, “We’re negotiating.” When asked about the hostages being held by Hamas, he reiterated, “We’re in the middle of negotiations.” 


He was also asked about his previous comment from the morning that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t doing enough to reach a possible cease-fire agreement but said only, “We’re still in negotiations. Not with him, but with my colleagues from Qatar and from Egypt.”
WASHINGTON — United States President Joe Biden says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough to reach a deal to free hostages in Gaza along with a cease-fire in its war with Hamas.
Biden spoke to reporters two days after six hostages, including one Israeli-American, were found after being killed by Hamas. Protests rocked Israel on Sunday.
Asked if Netanyahu was doing enough, Biden responded, “No.” Biden was arriving at the White House for a Situation Room meeting with advisers involved in negotiating a hostage deal and cease-fire. The president insisted that negotiators remain “very close” to a deal, adding that “hope springs eternal.”
A rare general strike in Israel is ending after a labor court ruled that it must stop by 2:30 p.m. local time. The court accepted a petition from the government saying it was politically motivated.
The head of Israel’s largest trade union, the Histadrut, says it will abide by the court decision and has instructed members to return to work. Arnon Bar-David had called for the general strike, the first since the start of the war, as Israelis shared grief and anger over the discovery of six dead hostages in Gaza.
The strike aimed to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking and health care. Municipalities in Israel’s populated central area including Tel Aviv participated, but others including Jerusalem did not, reflecting deep political divisions.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A suspected attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted a ship in the Red Sea on Monday, authorities said. 
Two projectiles hit the vessel, and a third explosion occurred near the ship, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said. 
“Damage control is underway,” UKMTO said. “There are no casualties onboard and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call.”
The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults.
The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a United States-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets.
The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian health authorities and United Nations agencies on Sunday began a large-scale campaign of vaccinations against polio in the Gaza Strip, hoping to prevent an outbreak in the territory that has been ravaged by the Israel-Hamas war.
Authorities plan to vaccinate children in central Gaza until Wednesday before moving on to the more devastated northern and southern parts of the strip. The campaign began with a small number of vaccinations on Saturday and aims to reach about 640,000 children.
Gaza’s Health Ministry said more than 72,600 children received vaccines Sunday.
The World Health Organization has said Israel agreed to limited pauses in the fighting to facilitate the campaign. There were initial reports of Israeli strikes in central Gaza early Sunday, but it was not immediately known if anyone was killed or wounded. The pause ended Sunday afternoon, according to a schedule released by Israel.
Israel has said the vaccination program will continue through Sept. 9 and last eight hours a day.
Gaza recently reported its first polio case in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in a leg. The World Health Organization says the presence of a paralysis case indicates there could be hundreds more who have been infected but aren’t showing symptoms.",False

The latest mass killing in the U.S. happened Saturday in Birmingham, Alabama, where four people were killed and more than a dozen injured outside a nightspot in what police described as a targeted “hit” by multiple shooters.
It was the country’s 31st mass killing this year, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University.
The Birmingham shooting occurred on the sidewalk and street outside Hush, a lounge in the Five Points South district. Police Chief Scott Thurmond said authorities believe the shooting targeted one of the people who was killed, possibly in a murder-for-hire. A vehicle pulled up and “multiple shooters” got out and began firing, then fled, he said. Investigators were trying to determine whether anyone fired back, creating crossfire. 
At least 135 people have died this year in mass killings, which are defined as incidents in which four or more people die within a 24-hour period, not including the killer — the same definition used by the FBI.
Last year ended with 217 deaths from 42 mass killings in the U.S., making 2023 one of the deadliest years on record.
Here is a look at other U.S. mass killings this year:

Before voters even begin casting ballots, Democrats and Republicans are engaged in a sprawling legal fight over the 2024 election through a series of court disputes that could even run past Nov. 5 if results are close.
Republicans filed more than 100 lawsuits challenging various aspects of vote-casting after being chastised repeatedly by judges in 2020 for bringing complaints about how the election was run only after votes were tallied.
After Donald Trump made "" election integrity "" a key part of his party’s platform following his false claims of widespread voter fraud in 2020, the Republican National Committee says it has more than 165,000 volunteers ready to watch the polls.
Democrats are countering with what they are calling “voter protection,” rushing to court to fight back against the GOP cases and building their own team with over 100 staffers, several hundred lawyers and what they say are thousands of volunteers.
Despite the flurry of litigation, the cases have tended to be fairly small-bore, with few likely impacts for most voters.
“When you have all this money to spend on litigation, you end up litigating less and less important stuff,” said Derek Muller, a law professor at Notre Dame University.
The stakes would increase dramatically should Trump lose and try to overturn the results. That’s what he attempted in 2020, but the court system rejected him across the board. Trump and his allies lost more than 60 lawsuits trying to reverse President Joe Biden’s win.


Whether they could be successful this year depends on the results, experts said. A gap of about 10,000 votes — roughly the number that separated Biden and Trump in Arizona and Georgia in 2020 — is almost impossible to reverse through litigation. A closer one of a few hundred votes, like the 547-vote margin that separated George W. Bush and Al Gore in Florida in 2000, is much more likely to hinge on court rulings about which ballots are legitimate.
“If he loses, he’s going to claim that he won. That goes without saying,” Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said of Trump. “If it looks like what we had last time … I expect we’ll see the same kind of thing.”
Trump has done nothing to discourage that expectation, saying he would accept the results of the election only if it’s “free and fair,” raising the possibility it would not be, something he continues to falsely contend was the case in 2020. He also continues to insist that he could only lose due to fraud.
“The only way they can beat us is to cheat,” Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in June.
To be clear, there was no widespread fraud in 2020 or any election since then. Reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Trump disputed his loss reaffirmed that Biden won. And Trump’s attorney general said there was no evidence that fraud tipped the election.
Trump installed his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, which then named attorney Christina Bobb as the head of its election integrity division. Bobb is a former reporter for the conservative One America News Network who has been indicted by Arizona’s attorney general for being part of an effort to promote a slate of Trump electors in the state, even though Biden won it.
Echoing Trump, the RNC said it’s trying to counter Democratic mischief.
What to know about the 2024 Election
“President Trump’s election integrity effort is dedicated to protecting every legal vote, mitigating threats to the voting process and securing the election,” RNC spokeswoman Claire Zunk said in a statement. “While Democrats continue their election interference against President Trump and the American people, our operation is confronting their schemes and preparing for November.”
This time around, Democrats say they’re prepared for whatever Republicans might do.
“For four years, Donald Trump and his MAGA allies have been scheming to sow distrust in our elections and undermine our democracy so they can cry foul when they lose,” Jen O’Malley Dillon, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign manager, said in a statement. “But also for four years, Democrats have been preparing for this moment, and we are ready for anything.”
The highest-profile litigation so far has been in Georgia, over new rules from a Republican-appointed majority on the State Board of Elections, which has echoed Trump’s conspiracy theories. The rules could allow members of local election boards to try to refuse to certify results, a gambit Trump supporters have tried, unsuccessfully, to reverse losses in 2020 and 2022.
A Trump-aligned group sued to have courts declare that election board members have that power while Democrats sued to overturn the new rules. GOP Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has questioned the wisdom of the board changing procedures so close to the election. Legal experts say the state board’s rules conflict with longstanding state law that certification is not optional.
Whether local boards delay or refuse to certify the results from the upcoming election has been a growing concern, especially after a handful of local officials took that step during this year’s primaries. But experts say the fears of a certification crisis are overblown, in large part because most state laws are clear that state or local boards must certify the official results brought to them by election offices. The courtroom remains the most important venue for candidates who want to challenge results.
“Trying to deny certification is a really poorly thought out theory,” Ben Ginsberg, a Republican election lawyer, said on a Thursday call with reporters. “It has never worked.”
The litigation to date has often been about relatively esoteric matters, but some cases could have implications after November if Trump loses. The RNC has filed lawsuits in Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina alleging the states need to remove inactive or ineligible voters from their rolls. Late last month, Republicans sued North Carolina over a favorite issue — the risk of noncitizens voting, which is rare. They contend the state wasn’t doing enough to safeguard against it. 
So far none of the claims have succeeded. But if Trump loses in those states by a narrow margin, that sort of pre-election litigation could pave the way for him to claim in court that the vote was invalid.
The other area that could have ramifications in November and beyond is whether mail ballots arriving after Election Day can be counted. Nineteen states allow that as long as the ballots are sent before polls close. The RNC sued to overturn this provision in Nevada and Mississippi, but both cases were dismissed by judges.
The RNC appealed those cases, and the first is scheduled to be heard by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later this month. It’s the sort of issue that could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. Some Trump allies in 2020 hoped the court would declare him the winner, but the late-arriving mail ballot litigation at the time showed the limits of that tactic.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state had to count mail ballots that arrived up to four days after Election Day. Republicans then appealed that ruling to the nation’s highest court, and late-arriving mail was counted separately in November 2020 while everyone waited for the Supreme Court to weigh in.
In the end, the Supreme Court didn’t take up the case. Trump lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes, so the 10,000 late-arriving mail ballots wouldn’t have even made a difference.",False

Publication date:2024-09-17 07:00:00

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans have blocked for a second time this year legislation to establish a nationwide right to in vitro fertilization, arguing that the vote is an election-year stunt after Democrats forced a vote on the issue. 
The Senate vote was Democrats’ latest attempt to force Republicans into a defensive stance on women’s health issues and highlight policy differences between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in the presidential race, especially as Trump has called himself a “ leader on IVF.”
The 51-44 vote was short of the 60 votes needed to move forward on the bill, with only two Republicans voting in favor. Democrats say Republicans who insist they support IVF are being hypocritical because they won’t support legislation guaranteeing a right to it. 
“They say they support IVF — here you go, vote on this,” said Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill’s lead sponsor and a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children.
The Democratic push started earlier this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the GOP-led legislature rushed to enact a law to provide legal protections for the clinics.
Democrats quickly capitalized, holding a vote in June on Duckworth’s bill and warning that the U.S. Supreme Court could go after the procedure next after it overturned the right to an abortion in 2022. 


The bill would establish a nationwide right for patients to access IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies and a right for doctors and insurance companies to provide it, an effort to pre-empt state efforts to limit the services. It would also require more health insurers to cover it and expand coverage for military service members and veterans.
In a statement after the vote, Harris said Republicans in Congress “have once again made clear that they will not protect access to the fertility treatments many couples need to fulfill their dream of having a child.”
Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who missed the vote because he was campaigning, said during a stop in Wisconsin that the measure was not a serious IVF bill, but a measure designed to make Republicans look bad.
“The Senate blocked a ridiculous showboat bill that had no chance of passing,” Vance said.
Republicans argued that the federal government shouldn’t tell states what to do and that the bill was an unserious effort. Only Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with Democrats to move forward on the bill both times. 
Meanwhile, Republicans have scrambled to counter Democrats on the issue, with many making clear that they support IVF treatments. Trump last month announced plans, without additional details, to require health insurance companies or the federal government to pay for the fertility treatment.
In his debate with Harris earlier this month, Trump said he was a “leader” on the issue and talked about the “very negative” decision by the Alabama court that was later reversed by the legislature.
South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said that Democrats are trying to create a political issue “where there isn’t one.” 
“Let me remind everybody that Republicans support IVF, full stop,” Thune said just before the vote. 
The issue has threatened to become a vulnerability for Republicans as some state laws passed by their party grant legal personhood not only to fetuses but to any embryos that are destroyed in the IVF process. Ahead of its convention this summer, the Republican Party adopted a policy platform that supports states establishing fetal personhood through the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which grants equal protection under the law to all American citizens. The platform also encourages supporting IVF but does not explain how the party plans to do so. 
Republicans have tried to push alternatives on the issue, including legislation that would discourage states from enacting explicit bans on the treatment, but those bills have been blocked by Democrats who say they are not enough. 
Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech then that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and proposed to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts. Republican Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have tried to pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned. 
Cruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said Democrats were holding the vote to “stoke baseless fears about IVF and push their broader political agenda.”",False

CINCINNATI (AP) — The Cincinnati Bengals entered the 2024 season with a healthy Joe Burrow and high expectations. 
After a disappointing 38-33 loss to the Washington Commanders on Monday night, the Bengals are 0-3 and their playoff hopes are hanging in the balance. 
“We didn’t envision ourselves in this spot but here we are,” Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said. “It’s a kick in the gut when you feel really good about the team and you start off 0-3. But again, that is where we are right now. We need to find a way to win next Sunday and get this thing moving in the right direction.”
Slow starts have been common during Taylor’s tenure, but most can be attributed to Burrow’s health. The Bengals have started 0-2 three straight seasons. They were winless through three games to start the 2020 season, but that included a tie. 
This is the worst start since they began the 2019 season 0-11, the year before they drafted Burrow No. 1 overall. 
On Monday night, Burrow was upstaged by fellow LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels who completed 21 of 23 passes for 254 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 39 yards and another TD. 
The Commanders figured to have success on the ground against a Bengals defense that struggles to stop the run. Cincinnati also was missing two key defensive lineman in B.J. Hill and Sheldon Rankins who were inactive with hamstring injuries. Washington rushed for 108 yards and three TDs on Monday. 


Bengals cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt didn’t help matters this week when he said Daniels and the Commanders ran a “Nice little college offense.” 
“That’s not what we do,” Taylor said. “We praise our own team. Praise the other team. We don’t take shots. That team hasn’t punted in two weeks. They’ve scored on every single possession the past two weeks. I have a tremendous amount of respect for what they’re doing over there.”

Bolstered by the return of wide receiver Tee Higgins from injury, the Bengals did their best to keep up with Daniels and the Commanders’ rushing attack. 
Ja’Marr Chase had six catches for 118 yards and two touchdowns. Higgins had three catches for 39 yards. Burrow passed for 324 yards and three TDs, but the Bengals’ offense wasn’t consistent enough. 
“We had our opportunities and didn’t cash in on them,” Burrow said. “We stalled out on some drives in the first half. That’s been the common denominator these first three weeks.” 
Following Monday night’s game, Burrow and Taylor were seen walking into the coaches offices rather than directly into the locker room as they typically do. Burrow acknowledged a private conversation with his head coach. 
“It was a very positive conversation,” Burrow said. “We’re not happy with where we’re at but by no means is the season over. There will be some critical thinking that I will have to do, to see what kind of leader I want to be going forward, whatever I feel the team needs from me.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Salvagers abandoned an initial effort to tow away a burning oil tanker in the Red Sea targeted by Yemen’s Houthi rebels as it “was not safe to proceed,” a European Union naval mission said Tuesday, leaving the Sounion stranded and its 1 million barrels of oil at risk of spilling.
While a major spill has yet to occur, the incident threatens to become one of the worst yet in the Iranian-backed rebels’ campaign that has disrupted the $1 trillion in goods that pass through the Red Sea each year over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. It also has halted some aid shipments to conflict-ravaged Sudan and Yemen.
“The private companies responsible for the salvage operation have concluded that the conditions were not met to conduct the towing operation and that it was not safe to proceed,” the EU’s Operation Aspides mission said, without elaborating. “Alternative solutions are now being explored by the private companies.”
The EU mission declined to answer questions from The Associated Press about the announcement, other than to say its “assets have been engaged in protecting the tugs involved.” The safety issue could be the fire burning aboard the vessel. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken Tuesday afternoon and analyzed by the AP showed the Sounion still ablaze.
The U.S. State Department has warned that a spill from the Sounion could be “four times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster” in 1989 off Alaska.


Meanwhile, there’s the threat of attacks by the Houthis, who on Monday targeted two other oil tankers traveling through the Red Sea. The Houthis have suggested they’ll allow a salvage operation to take place, but critics say the rebels have used the threat of an environmental disaster previously involving another oil tanker off Yemen to extract concessions from the international community.
The Houthis initially attacked the Greek-flagged Sounion tanker on Aug. 21 with small arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat. A French destroyer operating as part of Operation Aspides rescued its crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti.
Last week, the Houthis released footage showing they planted explosives on board the Sounion and ignited them in a propaganda video, something the rebels have done before in their campaign.
The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.
The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
There no American vessels known to be in the Red Sea at the moment as the EU mission has taken charge after the Sounion attack. A U.S. defense official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss information not made public, said the American military has not been asked and has no role in the cleanup or the towing of the Sounion.
The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower recently served a monthslong deployment in the Red Sea, facing the most intense, continuous combat the U.S. Navy has seen since World War II while fighting against the Houthis.
The U.S. aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, along with its carrier groups, are in the Gulf of Oman to counter a threatened Iranian retaliation against Israel over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Satellite pictures and a report Tuesday from the U.S. Navy Institute suggest the USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group, once with the Roosevelt, has moved into the Gulf of Aden. 
However, the U.S. has continued a campaign of airstrikes targeting the Houthis. A strike Tuesday destroyed a Houthi missile system, the U.S. military’s Central Command said.
“The onus is on the Houthis, again, to look at the impact that they’re having, not only in the short term, but on the long term as it relates to the environment, the economy and the safety of those that are transiting this important waterway,” said U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon’s press secretary. 
The Houthis’ attacks likely will continue until there’s a cease-fire in Gaza, warned Matthew Bey, a senior analyst at the RANE Network, a risk consultancy. Even then, there’s a risk that the rebels continue the attacks.
“The Houthis have learned quite a bit from what they’ve been doing over the last year — it’s been a very significant recruiting boon for them,” Bey said. “I think there are a lot of incentives for them to target shipping in the future because they’ve learned that they can be very successful in that. It brings in the West, which is kind of the enemy that they want to fight to some degree as well.”

DENVER (AP) — Masyn Winn homered, doubled and drove in four runs, Lars Nootbaar scored twice, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 7-3 on Tuesday night.
St. Louis rallied to spoil the beginning of the last homestand of Charlie Blackmon’s career with a run in the seventh and four in the eighth. Blackmon tripled and doubled.
Blackmon, who announced he will retire at the end of the season, received a standing ovation when he led off the bottom of the first before getting hit by Cardinals starter Michael McGreevy.
His triple in the fifth gave Colorado a 3-2 lead. It was the 68th of his career, the most in franchise history, but the lead didn’t hold up after starter Ryan Feltner left the game one pitch into the seventh inning with cramping in his pitching arm.
“It was pretty much the whole front side of my arm, just tightness,” Feltner said of his right arm. “It was compounding over the course of the game. Nothing crazy.”
The Cardinals tied it in the seventh when Colorado’s mistake on a comebacker to reliever Victor Vodnik loaded the bases, and Nootbaar scored from third on shortstop Ezequiel Tovar’s wild relay throw on a potential inning-ending double play.
“It was a crazy play and worked out our way,” St. Louis manager Oli Marmol said of the comebacker.
The Cardinals scored four runs in the eighth of Angel Chivilli (1-3) on RBI singles by Jordan Walker and Victor Scott II and Winn’s two-run double.


The rookie shook off a minor injury to drive in a season-high four runs.
“I was in the cages and took a weird swing earlier and kind of tweaked my triceps,” Winn said. “I wanted to be in there, especially getting towards the end of this thing. I want to be out there and compete and play as much as I can.”
Andrew Kittredge (5-5) pitched the seventh inning for the win.
McGreevy escaped the first loss of his career when St. Louis tied it in the seventh. He allowed three runs on four hits in the second start and third appearance of his career. His ERA rose from 0.90 to 2.40.
The Cardinals opened the scoring in the third on Winn’s two-run homer, his 15th of the season.
“Feltner threw the ball well,” manager Bud Black said. “He got stronger as the game went on but unfortunately he started cramping.”
Aaron Schunk’s second home run of the season, a solo shot in bottom of the third, made it 2-1, and the Rockies tacked on two more in the fifth. Schunk’s dribbler to third drove in Sam Hilliard and Blackmon hit his team-leading fifth triple to center.
Rockies: 2B Brendan Rodgers was out of the lineup with a hamstring injury. Black said it was a nagging injury and considers Rodgers day to day.
The Cardinals will send RHP Erick Fedde (8-9, 3.38 ERA) to the mound against former St. Louis LHP Austin Gomber (5-11, 4.67) in the second of the three-game series on Wednesday night.

NEW YORK (AP) — With presidential candidates looking on, some 9/11 victims’ relatives appealed to them Wednesday for accountability as the U.S. marked an anniversary laced with election-season politics.
In a remarkable tableau, President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris stood together at ground zero just hours after Trump and Harris faced off in their first-ever debate. Trump and Biden — the successor whose inauguration Trump skipped — shook hands, and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared to facilitate a handshake between Harris and Trump.
AP AUDIO: AP correspondent Julie Walker reports the U.S. remembers the lives taken by the 9/11 attacks, marking the anniversary with both family and politics.
Then the campaign rivals stood only a few feet (meters) apart, Biden and Bloomberg between them, as the hourslong reading of victims’ names began. At Trump’s side was his running mate, Sen. JD Vance.

The image was one of putting politics aside at this year’s solemn commemoration of the hijacked-plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001. But some victims’ relatives, after reading out names, delivered political messages of their own.

“We are pleading for your help, but you ignore us,” Allison Walsh-DiMarzio said, directly challenging Trump and Harris to press Saudi Arabia about any official involvement in the attacks. Most of the 19 hijackers were Saudi, but the kingdom denies it was behind their plot.
“Which one of you will have the courage to be our hero? We deserve better,” Walsh-DiMarzio said. She’s a daughter of 9/11 victim Barbara P. Walsh, an administrative assistant.


Joanne Barbara was one of multiple readers who spoke out against a now-revoked plea deal that military prosecutors struck with alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two fellow defendants.
“It has been 23 years, and the families deserve justice and accountability,” said the widow of Assistant Fire Chief Gerard A. Barbara.
Biden, on his last Sept. 11 in office, and Harris paid respects Wednesday at all three 9/11 attack sites: ground zero, the Pentagon and a rural part of Pennsylvania.
The president, vice president — and, separately, Trump — laid wreaths Wednesday afternoon at the Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Biden and Harris spoke with victims’ relatives and visited the local fire department; Trump and Vance went to a New York City firehouse earlier in the day.
The Flight 93 memorial stands where one of the hijacked planes crashed after crew members and passengers tried to storm the cockpit. Trump described the site as an “incredible place” in brief remarks from afar to reporters.
The attacks killed 2,977 people and left thousands of bereaved relatives and scarred survivors. The planes took down the World Trade Center’s twin towers and carved a gash in the Pentagon, the U.S. military headquarters, where Biden and Harris laid a red, white and blue wreath Wednesday afternoon. 
While many Americans may not observe 9/11 anniversaries anymore, “the men and women of the Department of Defense remember,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said earlier in the day.
The attacks altered U.S. foreign policy, domestic security practices and the mindset of many Americans who had not previously felt vulnerable to foreign extremists.
Effects rippled around the world. Victims came from more than 90 different countries, and the U.S. responded to the attacks with a “ Global War on Terrorism.” U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq killed hundreds of thousands of Afghans and Iraqis and thousands of American troops.
Communities around the country hold events on the anniversary, which Congress has titled both Patriot Day and a National Day of Service and Remembrance. 
Thousands of Americans commemorate it with volunteer work — among them Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. He packed meals in St. Paul for people in need.
During early anniversaries at ground zero, presidents and other officeholders read poems, parts of the Declaration of Independence and other texts.
But the National Sept. 11 Memorial and Museum decided in 2012 to limit the ceremony to relatives reading victims’ names.
If politicians “care about what’s actually going on, great. Be here,” said Korryn Bishop, who attended Wednesday to remember her cousin John F. McDowell Jr., who worked in finance. “If they’re just here for political clout, that upsets me.” 
Brandon Jones was glad politicians weren’t on the podium.
“This should be a site for coming together to find feasible solutions and peace. This should not be a place to score political points to get brownie points to round up your base,” said Jones. He’s a cousin of victim Jon Richard Grabowski, an insurance firm technology executive.
In 2008, then-senators and presidential campaign rivals John McCain and Barack Obama jointly paid their respects at ground zero. 
Eight years later, the Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, abruptly left the trade center ceremony, stumbled while awaiting her motorcade and later disclosed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia. The episode stirred fresh attention to her health, which her Republican opponent — Trump, who was also at that observance — had been questioning for months.
Over the years, some victims’ relatives have used the forum to exhort leaders to prioritize national security, acknowledge the casualties of the war on terror, complain that officials are politicizing 9/11 and even criticize individual officeholders. Others bemoan Americans’ divisions or decry violence.
“It’s my prayer that this wicked act called terrorism will never occur again,” Jacob Afuakwah said Wednesday. He lost his brother, Emmanuel Akwasi Afuakwah, a restaurant worker.
But many family members stick to tributes and personal reflections. Increasingly they come from children and young adults born after the attacks killed one of their relatives.
Thirteen-year-old twins Brady and Emily Henry read names to honor their uncle, firefighter Joseph Patrick Henry.
“We promise to continue telling your stories,” Emily Henry said, “and we’ll never let anyone forget all those lost on Sept. 11.”

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson said Tuesday his campaign has hired a law firm to help investigate a CNN report stating he made explicit racial and sexual posts on a pornography website’s message board.
The lawyers will look at how what Robinson calls “false smears” originated. 
The announcement comes as more North Carolina Republicans disturbed by last week’s report said that if Robinson can’t formally refute the accusations quickly, the GOP should shift its focus to competitive in-state races. 
Other Republicans already have abandoned Robinson, the sitting lieutenant governor. The Republican Governors Association said Monday it will no longer support Robinson. His campaign had benefitted from the group spending millions of dollars in advertising in his race with Democratic nominee Josh Stein, whom polls have shown leading Robinson. Most of Robinson’s top campaign staffers also quit in the report’s fallout.
GOP officials are anxious that Robinson’s situation could pull down Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and help Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the battleground state, and threaten the outcomes of other key seats on the ballot. 
“He should conclusively and quickly prove false the allegations against him,” Hal Weatherman, who is seeking to succeed Robinson as lieutenant governor, said on X. Weatherman runs separately from Robinson but received his endorsement. “If he can prove this isn’t true and was fabricated to hurt him, he will win in a landslide. But if he fails to do so, he will lose, because the comments being attributed to him are highly disturbing.”


Robinson, a favorite of the state GOP’s conservative base and who would be the state’s first Black governor if elected, has denied writing the messages from more than a decade ago, well before he became active in politics. In a news release, Robinson said he was confident the Binnall Law Group from northern Virginia “will leave no stone unturned and enable us to use every legal means to hold CNN accountable for their lies.” Firm partner Jesse Binnall has represented Trump and his campaign in litigation. 
CNN’s report unearthed posts it said Robinson left on a porn site’s message boards in which he referred to himself as a “black NAZI;” said he enjoyed transgender pornography; said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama; and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as “worse than a maggot.” Robinson has a history of inflammatory comments on abortion, LGBTQ+ issues and the role of women that Stein and his allies have used against him for months.
CNN didn’t immediately respond to an email Tuesday seeking comment. Last week, CNN said it had matched details of an account on the pornographic website forum to other online accounts held by Robinson by comparing usernames, a known email address and his full name. CNN reported that details discussed by the account holder matched Robinson’s age, length of marriage and other biographical information..
At a campaign event Monday, Robinson said he would be “coming after CNN full throttle.” He hasn’t provided evidence that would counter the broadcast report. 
What to know about the 2024 Election
Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina endorsed a Robinson rival in the March gubernatorial primary and has questioned Robinson’s qualifications for the post. Speaking with reporters Tuesday in Washington, Tillis proposed that Robinson should by Friday present evidence that would form the basis for litigation to “defend his name or in the absence of a defense, then we’ve got to move on.”
Robinson was endorsed by Trump before the primary and has spoken at the former president’s in-state rallies. But he was not involved in a Trump rally in Wilmington last weekend and Trump didn’t mention him. Trump has another North Carolina event on Wednesday. 
Speaking in Charlotte on Monday, Trump running mate JD Vance said it was up to North Carolina voters to decide what they think of Robinson’s messages and whether they believe Robinson’s defense.
A Republican Governors Association spokesperson said this week that no further ad placements had been made in the race after Tuesday. 
Data from AdImpact, which monitors campaign spending, shows that the RGA and a separate political action committee associated with the group had spent at least $15.9 million on television and online advertising in the North Carolina general election race. Stein’s campaign and his allied groups have widely outspent Robinson and his allies during the general election so far, according to data.
The deadline for any North Carolina gubernatorial candidate to withdraw from the race was Sept. 19.",False

Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar thanked Lebanon’s Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah for his support in the ongoing war with Israel in a letter released Friday by Hezbollah’s media office.
In the letter, dated Monday, Sinwar thanks Nasrallah for the “blessed acts” of Iran-backed groups in their support for Hamas since Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250. Sinwar called the war “one of the most honorable battles for the Palestinian people.” 
On Oct. 8, Hezbollah started attacking Israeli military posts along the border, triggering an ongoing exchange of fire that has left hundreds dead.
Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since the Israel-Hamas war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count. 
The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, and the United Nations reported the Palestinian economy is in a free fall. The report from the U.N. Trade and Development also warned of “rapid and alarming economic decline” in the West Bank, citing expanded Israeli settlements, land confiscations, demolition of Palestinian buildings and violence by settlers as dampening economic prospects.
Here’s the latest:
JERUSALEM — The U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees says that one of its staffers was shot and killed during an Israeli military raid in the West Bank, the first such shooting of an agency staffer in the occupied territory in more than a decade.


The United Nations Relief and Works Agency said Friday that a sniper fatally shot one of the agency’s sanitation workers on the roof of his home in the Faraa urban refugee camp in the northern West Bank during an Israeli military operation early Thursday. The UNRWA identified the worker as Sufyan Jawwad.
Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani confirmed that Israeli forces had killed the UNRWA employee in Faraa, saying that he had been throwing explosive devices at Israeli troops when he was shot. Shoshani also alleged that Jawwad had a past record of militant activity, without providing evidence.
“This is yet another example of an UNRWA employee taking active part in terrorist activities against Israel,” Shoshani said.
UNRWA did not immediately respond to the Israeli army allegations.
UNRWA was thrown into crisis earlier this year when Israel accused a dozen UNRWA employees of participating in Hamas’ devastating Oct. 7 attacks.
The relationship between UNRWA and Israel has long been tense because of the agency’s mission to care for Palestinian refugees and their descendants — now estimated at 6 million spread across the Middle East — who fled or were pushed from their homes during the 1948 war over Israel’s creation.
CAIRO — Israeli airstrikes continued to hit Gaza overnight and early Friday, killing at least 12 people in their homes, the Palestinian territory’s Civil Defense said. 
The strikes hit homes in Deir al Balah’s Nuseirat Camp as well as in Rafah, it said. In Nuseirat, three people died, including a woman and a child, and eleven others were injured by the strikes. In Rafah, strikes killed five people, including two children, Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal said.
Israeli strikes resumed Friday afternoon, killing another person in Nuseirat and three people in Gaza City.
Bassal said a day earlier that 16 people were killed by airstrikes on Gaza City on Thursday.
The strikes come nearly a day after health workers wrapped up the first round of the polio vaccination campaign during which hundreds of thousands of children were vaccinated. The second dose of the vaccine is expected to be provided in the coming weeks, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).
Gaza’s health ministry said Thursday that 41,119 Palestinians were killed, and 95,125 others were injured since the Israel-Hamas war broke out last October. 
BEIRUT — The leader of the Palestinian Hamas group thanked Lebanon’s Hezbollah chief for his support in the ongoing war with Israel in a letter released Friday by Hezbollah’s media office.
Yahya Sinwar’s letter came in response to a message sent earlier by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in which he paid his condolence for the July killing of top Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh during a visit to Iran.
In the letter, dated Monday, Sinwar thanks Nasrallah for the “blessed acts” of Iran-backed groups in their support for Hamas since the Israel-Hamas war started Oct. 7, calling the war “one of the most honorable battles for the Palestinian people.”
A day after the militants’ bloody incursion into Israel that started the war, Hezbollah started attacking Israeli military posts along the border, triggering an ongoing exchange of fire. More than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli strikes since Oct. 8, most of them fighters with Hezbollah and other armed groups, but also more than 100 civilians. In northern Israel, 23 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed by strikes from Lebanon.
ISTANBUL — Turkish officials held a brief ceremony Friday at Istanbul International Airport where the body of a Turkish American activist killed by Israeli gunfire arrived ahead of her funeral and burial in a town on the Aegean coast.
Istanbul Gov. Davut Gul and other officials held prayers in front of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi’s coffin, which was draped in the Turkish flag, before helping carry it to another plane for the city of Izmir. Her funeral is expected to be held Saturday in the town of Didim, near Izmir.
The 26-year-od activist from Seattle was killed Sept. 6 following a demonstration against Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, according to an Israeli protester who witnessed the shooting.
The Israeli military said Tuesday that Eygi was likely shot “indirectly and unintentionally” by Israeli forces. Turkey announced it will conduct its own investigation into her death.",False

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers will likely be without All-Pro tight end George Kittle for Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Rams.
The Niners listed Kittle on Friday as doubtful for the game after he reported a sore hamstring following practice on Wednesday. 
The Niners will also be without All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey, who went on injured reserve last week with Achilles tendinitis, and star receiver Deebo Samuel, who strained his calf last week. 
If Kittle is unable to go, the 49ers would be missing three of their four players who gained at least 1,000 yards from scrimmage last season. Kittle, McCaffrey and Samuel accounted for 39 of the team’s 60 offensive touchdowns last season.
Quarterback Brock Purdy has had plays in his career without those three stars on the field, according to ESPN. He is 3 for 7 for 49 yards and an interception on those plays, with five of the plays coming in mop-up duty of a blowout loss against Kansas City before Purdy took over as starter. 
Eric Saubert would get the start at tight end if Kittle is unable to play. Saubert played 45 offensive snaps in his first two games with San Francisco and had two catches for 26 yards last week against the Vikings.
“I thought he’s done a hell of a job,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday. “He’s stepped in well. Kittle was cramping most of the game, so he had to do a lot throughout the Minnesota game. He’s been real consistent since he’s been here. If he’s got to do it all, he’s up for the challenge. He’s shown he can help us in the passing and the run game.”


Jordan Mason has filled in well for McCaffrey the first two weeks with 247 yards rushing and two TDs and could become the seventh player ever to rush for at least 100 yards and a TD in each of the first three games of the season.

The Niners would still have second-team All-Pro Brandon Aiyuk, who has struggled the first two games following a contract dispute that held him out of practice all of training camp, and Jauan Jennings at receiver.
In other injury news, the 49ers will get safety Talanoa Hufanga back this week for the first time since he tore his ACL last November. Defensive end Nick Bosa (ribs) and cornerback Charvarius Ward (knee, hamstring) are both listed as questionable.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — One more person has died from mass shootings at two houses on the same street in a South African village over the weekend, bringing the death toll to 18, officials said Monday.
Police are still searching for the assailants who opened fire Saturday on people who had reportedly gathered for a family event in Lusikisiki village in Eastern Cape province.
The shootings, which took place in two separate houses on the same street, fueled outrage over a recent spate of mass shootings in the country.
The motive for the killings remains unknown and police said on Monday that the investigation is continuing and no arrests have been made.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa condemned the killings and promised that the government would deploy all needed resources in the investigation.
He said Monday that 38 people had been killed in previous mass shootings in the past two years and 25 suspects have been arrested.
“I feel deeply for all the families and members of the broader community affected by this attack, and on behalf of all of us as South Africans, I offer you our deepest sympathies,” he said.
“While we are united in our grief, we are also united in our outrage and condemnation of this excessive criminal assault which will not go unpunished,” he said.
The shootings follow a mass killing in KwaZulu-Natal province in April 2023. Ten members of the same family, including seven women and a 13-year-old boy, were killed at their home.


Sixteen people were fatally shot in a bar in the Johannesburg township of Soweto in 2022, the worst mass shooting in South Africa in decades before the latest killings in Lusikisiki.
South Africa has one of the highest homicide rates in the world. It recorded 12,734 homicides in the first six months of this year, according to police.

BALTIMORE (AP) — Blake Snell struck out 12 over six innings and allowed just one hit to carry the San Francisco Giants past the faltering Baltimore Orioles 10-0 on Tuesday night.
The Orioles have lost seven of nine to fall four games behind the first-place Yankees in the AL East. Baltimore held a half-game lead on Sept. 5 before its current tailspin, during which it has been outscored 46-18.
Colton Cowser had two of the Orioles’ five hits in their most lopsided shutout loss of the season.
“We’ve been scuffling offensively,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “We had a tough night.”
In this one, the Giants got the only run they needed when Mike Yastrzemski drove the second pitch from Orioles starter Albert Suárez (8-6) over the right-field wall. Yastrzemski added an RBI single in the second after a sacrifice fly by Brett Wisely, and Snell had no problem making the lead stand up.
“Getting runs early on, it feels good to pitch with a lead,” Snell said. “You can be more aggressive.”
Facing a Baltimore lineup without several injured starters, Snell (4-3) flashed the form that enabled him to win the 2023 NL Cy Young Award. The left-hander had at least two strikeouts in every inning but the fourth, and made up for it by striking out the side in the fifth.
“We faced one of the better pitches in the game, and we didn’t swing the bats well against him,” Hyde said. 
Snell struck out All-Star Gunnar Henderson three times, the last one in the sixth to culminate his 98-pitch masterpiece.


“Gunnar. Changeups. He just struggles with them,” Snell said. “A lot of lefties do.”
Snell waked two, and the only hit he allowed was a solid third-inning single up the middle by Emmanuel Rivera.
“I like where I was at mentally today,” Snell said.
Since his return from the injured list on July 9 following a groin strain, Snell is 4-0 with a 1.33 ERA with 105 strikeouts in 74 1/3 innings.
“The guy’s unbelievable. He’s on top of it right now,” Yastrzemski said. “He’s a special pitcher. It’s pretty cool to see how dominant he can be.”
San Francisco turned the game into a rout with a six-run ninth against Craig Kimbrel, who long ago lost his job as Baltimore’s closer due to ineffectiveness.
The Giants snapped a four-game losing streak to begin their final road trip of the season.
Giants: SS Tyler Fitzgerald returned to the starting lineup after missing three games with lower back tightness. ... INF Matt Chapman headed home to be with his wife, who was ready to give birth. 
Orioles: INF Jordan Westburg (hand) took batting practice and is expected to return before the end of the regular season, general manager Mike Elias said. ... 1B Ryan Mountcastle (wrist) is working out in Florida and has a chance to return before October. ... INF Ramón Urías (ankle sprain) could come off the IL before the end of the season, Elias said. ... RHP Grayson Rodriguez (lat strain) is making progress.

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The Biden administration on Friday asked an appeals court to revive a Trump-era rule that lifted remaining Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves in the U.S.
If successful, the move would put the predators under state oversight nationwide and open the door for hunting to resume in the Great Lakes region after it was halted two years ago under court order.
Environmentalists had successfully sued when protections for wolves were lifted in former President Donald Trump’s final days in office.
Friday’s filing with the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals was President Joe Biden administration’s first explicit step to revive that rule. Protections will remain in place pending the court’s decision. 
The court filing follows years of political acrimony as wolves have repopulated some areas of the western U.S., sometimes attacking livestock and eating deer, elk and other big game. 
Environmental groups want that expansion to continue since wolves still occupy only a fraction of their historic range.
Attempts to lift or reduce protections for wolves date to the first term of former President George W. Bush more than two decades ago and have continued with each subsequent administration.
They once roamed most of North America but were widely decimated by the mid-1900s in government-sponsored trapping and poisoning campaigns. Gray wolves were granted federal protections in 1974.


Each time the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declares them recovered, the agency is challenged in court. Wolves in different parts of the U.S. lost and regained protections multiple times in recent years.
“The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is focused on a concept of recovery that allows wolves to thrive on the landscape while respecting those who work and live in places that support them,” agency spokesperson Vanessa Kauffman said.
The administration is on the same side in the case as livestock and hunting groups, the National Rifle Association and Republican-led Utah.
It’s opposed by the Sierra Club, Center for Biological Diversity, Humane Society of the United States and other groups.
“While wolves are protected, they do very well, and when they lose protections, that recovery backslides,” said Collette Adkins with the Center for Biological Diversity. “We won for good reason at the district court.”
She said she was “saddened” officials were trying to reinstate the Trump administration’s rule.
Efforts to restore wolves to date have been limited to a handful of regions. Federal officials earlier this year agreed to develop a first-ever national recovery plan, by December 2025, under a settlement in a separate lawsuit.
Kauffman declined to say whether that national plan would still be pursued if the government prevails in the 9th Circuit case.
But attorneys suggested in Friday’s court filing that the government is ready to move on from gray wolf recovery, now that the species is no longer in danger of extinction.
“The ESA (Endangered Species Act) is clear: its goal is to prevent extinction, not to restore species to their pre-western settlement numbers and range,” U.S. Department of Justice attorneys wrote.
The 2022 ruling that restored protections said wildlife officials had failed to show wolf populations could be sustained in the Midwest and portions of the West. Officials also didn’t adequately consider threats to wolves outside those core areas, said U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in California.
The Great Lakes region has more than 4,000 wolves. More than 2,000 wolves occupy states in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest.
 Congress circumvented the courts in 2011 and stripped federal safeguards in the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains. Thousands of wolves have since been killed in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.
Lawmakers have continued to press for state control in the western Great Lakes region. When those states gained jurisdiction over wolves briefly under the Trump rule, trappers and hunters using hounds blew past harvest goals in Wisconsin and killed almost twice as many as planned. 
Michigan and Minnesota have previously held hunts but not in recent years.
Wolves are present but no public hunting is allowed in states including Washington, Oregon, California and Colorado. They’ve never been protected in Alaska, where tens of thousands of the animals live.
The Biden administration last year rejected requests from conservation groups to restore protections for gray wolves across the northern Rockies. That decision, too, has been challenged.
State lawmakers in that region, which includes Yellowstone National Park and vast areas of wilderness, are intent on culling more wolf packs. But federal officials determined the predators were not in danger of being wiped out entirely under the states’ loosened hunting rules.
The U.S. also is home to small, struggling populations of red wolves in the mid-Atlantic region and Mexican wolves in the Southwest. Those populations are both protected as endangered.",False

Playing just two days after a feisty Premier League match against Arsenal, Manchester City fielded a heavily rotated team and still had too much for second-tier Watford in the English League Cup.
City won 2-1 thanks to first-half goals by Jeremy Doku and Matheus Nunes at Etihad Stadium as the third round continued Tuesday with fellow top-flight teams Chelsea, Aston Villa and Leicester also advancing.
Chelsea thrashed fourth-division Barrow 5-0, with Christopher Nkunku scoring a hat trick and celebrating by inflating a blue balloon and holding it between his lips. Villa won 2-1 at third-tier Wycombe and Leicester triumphed 3-0 in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 draw at fourth-tier Walsall.
The last 32 of the competition is being spread over two midweeks to accommodate the expanded Champions League and Europa League. Manchester United and Tottenham were among those to advance last week, while Liverpool and Arsenal play their games on Wednesday.
City manager Pep Guardiola won the League Cup four straight years with City from 2018, but said he isn’t going to take it seriously this season and will use the matches to give rhythm to some fringe players.
“We are not going to waste energy on this competition, for sure,” he said.
Doku was one of just two Man City players — along with Kyle Walker — to start both the dramatic 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Sunday and against Watford. The Belgium winger put his team ahead in the fifth minute by shooting home from just inside the area after City seized on a misplaced back-pass.


Nunes added the second in 38th with a low, left-footed shot for the Portugal midfielder’s first goal since joining from Wolverhampton in the offseason on 2023.
Tom Ince — the son of former England midfielder Paul Ince — scored for Watford in the 86th.
Chelsea also rotated its lineup, making 11 changes from the team that started the 3-0 win at West Ham on Saturday.
Nkunku scored the opening two goals by the 15th minute and rounded off the scoring in the 75th. In between was an own-goal and a tap-in by Pedro Neto for his first goal for Chelsea.
Colombia forward Jhon Durán continued his brilliant start to the season for Villa by scoring the team’s second goal — from the penalty spot in the 85th — to add to Emi Buendia’s opener in the 55th.
The 20-year-old Durán has netted four times in five league matches so far this season, all off the bench.
Wycombe’s consolation came in the fifth minute of stoppage time.
Walsall was unable to complete an upset over Leicester after taking its Premier League opponent to spot kicks at home.
Leicester converted all three of its penalties, while Walsall failed with its first three attempts to bring the shootout to its earliest possible conclusion.

An arbitration board has ruled that U.S. Steel may proceed with its proposed acquisition by Nippon Steel, a deal that faces strong opposition from its workforce.
The board, which was jointly chosen by U.S. Steel and the United Steelworkers to decide disputes between them, said Wednesday that U. S. Steel has satisfied each of the conditions of the successorship clause of its basic labor agreement with the union. It determined that no further action under the agreement was necessary in order to proceed with the closing of the proposed transaction with Nippon Steel.
USW had filed a series of grievances in January alleging that the successorship clause had not been satisfied. The union has previously stated that it doesn’t believe Nippon fully understands its commitment to steelworkers, retirees and its communities. USW has expressed concern about the enforcement of its labor agreements, having transparency into Nippon’s finances, as well as national defense, infrastructure and supply-chain issues. 
The arbitration board heard evidence and arguments from U.S. Steel and USW last month.
The board said Wednesday that it recognized the repeated written commitments Nippon made to fulfill the requirements of the successorship clause and that no further actions were required by the company. The written commitments include Nippon’s pledge to invest at least $1.4 billion in USW-represented facilities, not to conduct layoffs or plant closings during the term of the basic labor agreement, and to protect the best interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters.
“With the arbitration process now behind us, we look forward to moving ahead with our pending transaction with Nippon Steel,” U.S. Steel President and CEO David Burritt said in a statement. 


USW said in a statement on Wednesday that it disagreed with the arbitration board’s result. 
“Nippon’s commitment to our facilities and jobs remains as uncertain as ever, and executives in Tokyo can still change U.S. Steel’s business plans and wipe them away at any moment,” the union said. “We’re clearly disappointed with the decision, but it does nothing to change our opposition to the deal or our resolve to fight for our jobs and communities that hang in the balance in this transaction.”
President Joe Biden has previously voiced his opposition to Nippon Steel buying U.S. Steel, but the federal government appears to be in no hurry to block the deal.
Earlier this month White House officials did not deny that the president would formally block the acquisition. But the necessary report from the government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has yet to be submitted to the White House. 
The proposed takeover carries some heavy political weight in Pennsylvania, a state that both Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump view as a must-win in November’s presidential election. U.S. Steel is headquartered in Pittsburgh.
Biden, Harris and Trump have all come out against the deal. Harris spoke at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh on Wednesday where she pledged to build an economy that is both pro-business and helps the middle class.",False

AURORA, Colo. (AP) — Police in the Denver suburb of Aurora say a Venezuela street gang with a small presence in the city has not taken over a rundown apartment complex — yet the allegation continues to gain steam among conservatives and was amplified by former President Donald Trump in a Wednesday Fox News town hall where he said Venezuelans were “taking over the whole town.” 
The unsubstantiated allegation gained momentum following last month’s dissemination of video from a resident in the complex that showed armed men knocking on an apartment door, intensifying fears the Tren de Aragua gang was in control of the six-building complex.
However, city officials indicate the buildings, along with two other apartment complexes, were run down because of neglect by the property manager, CBZ Management.
Aurora is a diverse city that has long grappled with crime and gangs, and police said they have so far linked 10 people to Tren de Aragua and arrested six of them, including the suspects in a July attempted homicide.
But in a visit to the apartments where the armed men were filmed, interim Aurora police chief Heather Morris said gang members had not taken over and weren’t collecting rent. The remarks came after Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman said that “criminal elements” had taken over some unspecified buildings and were extorting residents. 
Aurora Police agent Matthew Longshore reiterated Thursday in an email to The Associated Press that the agency has confirmed residents are not paying rent to gang members, but they found apartment managers are no longer sending representatives to the complex.


The City of Aurora is already taking legal action against Zev Baumgarten with CBZ for “years of neglecting properties and numerous code violations” after another building he managed in Aurora was shut down as uninhabitable. Its residents were evicted in mid-August. Trials for Baumgarten that had been scheduled for August and September have been delayed for at least six months.
CBZ didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking comment, and phone numbers listed for the two open apartment buildings managed by CBZ in Aurora were disconnected.
After residents held a news conference to speak out against the gang claims, Coffman, a Republican and former congressman, conceded he was “not sure where the truth is in all of this.” In an interview this week with Denver7 TV station, Coffman said the narrative that all of Aurora was unsafe was not true and harmful to the economic health of the rapidly growing city of more than 400,000 people. 
Coffman wasn’t immediately available Thursday to speak about the situation. 
Trump has sought to capitalize on concerns over immigration as he seeks a second term in November. At Wednesday night’s town hall, he repeated his call for mass deportations after overstating the gang situation in Aurora.
“Take a look at Aurora in Colorado, where Venezuelans are taking over the whole town, they’re taking over buildings, the whole town,” Trump said. “You saw it the other day they’re knocking down doors and occupying apartments of people.”
Among the nearly 1 million Venezuelan migrants who entered the U.S. in recent years were suspected gang members tied to police shootings, human trafficking and other crimes — yet there’s no evidence that the gang has set up an organizational structure in the U.S., Jeremy McDermott, the Colombia-based co-director of InSight Crime, told the AP this summer. He published a recent report on Tren de Aragua’s expansion.
Social media posts about a video purporting to show migrants taking over a school bus in San Diego and a 911 call reporting Venezuelan migrants taking over an apartment building in Chicago have also gotten attention lately. Both were unsubstantiated. 
Many of the immigrants from Venezuela and other Latin American countries who live in the Aurora complex say there are no gangs there, and they are being unfairly painted as criminals. 
They pinned blame on New York-based CBZ Management for refusing to take care of bedbugs, rodents and constant water leaks despite monthly rent costing $1,200 or more. Residents fear they could be evicted, but the city said Wednesday there were no immediate plans to pursue that option.
“The only criminal here is the owner of the building,” Moises Didenot, who is from Venezuela, said Tuesday through a translator at a news conference in a dusty courtyard at the complex.
He showed reporters some mice he recently caught on sticky traps in the basement apartment he shares with his wife and 11-year-old daughter. Only two of the burners on their stove work, their ceiling fan is missing a blade and as soon as they clean their bathtub, mold quickly creeps back, he said.
Aurora officials said in an Aug. 30 social media post that they were taking the Venezuela gang’s presence seriously and indicated more arrests were expected. They also said they would “continue to address the problems that the absentee, out-of-state owners of these properties have allowed to fester unchecked.”
The video helping fuel the unsubstantiated allegation showed armed men, including one holding a long gun, climbing up the stairs and knocking on an apartment door. The former residents who filmed it told KDVR-TV it was taken before a shooting at the complex on Aug. 18 in which a 25-year-old man later died.
An Aurora Police Department spokesperson, Sydney Edwards, said that police have been in possession of the video and seized evidence seen in it. She said she could not comment further about an ongoing investigation.
Aurora police have also announced a task force with local, state and federal enforcement agencies to specifically address concerns about Tren de Aragua and other criminal activity affecting migrant communities.
“We will continue to investigate, pursue and arrest those who commit crimes, and we will maintain a robust presence at these properties,” the city said in a statement Thursday.

CLEVELAND (AP) — Willi Castro hit a two-run homer, Matt Wallner had two RBIs and the Minnesota Twins bounced back from a crushing loss in the series opener to beat the Cleveland Guardians 4-1 on Tuesday night and stay locked into the final AL wild card.
Castro connected in the eighth inning, and both of Wallner’s RBI singles came off Gavin Williams (3-10), who has just one win in his last seven starts.
The Twins entered with a 1 1/2-game lead over Detroit for the last playoff berth, and they kept it with solid defense, strong relief and Castro’s big swing one night after blowing a 3-0 lead on Monday.
“The energy has been good. The last few games have been rough for us,” said Castro, who homered for the first time since Aug. 24. “We’ve got to keep it going.”
Lane Thomas homered for the AL Central-leading Guardians, who are closing in on the postseason. They can still clinch a spot on Wednesday.
Cleveland rallied for its MLB-leading 40th comeback win on Monday, storming back against the Twins.
Minnesota held on this time, but not before the Guardians made it interesting.
They loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth before manager Rocco Baldelli, who had to piece together the final four innings after pulling rookie Zebby Matthews in the fifth, brought in Griffin Jax.
The right-hander, who gave up rookie Kyle Manzardo’s go-ahead homer in the eighth on Monday, struck out pinch-hitter David Fry and gave up an infield single before retiring Bo Naylor on a dribbler for his ninth save.


When it ended, there was a collective sigh of relief from Minnesota’s dugout.
“Great win for our entire team,” Baldelli said. “Everywhere you looked — in the dugout, out in the bullpen — everyone played a part in some small way. There’s a lot to clap about and talk about.”
Cole Sands (9-1) worked one inning for the win as the Twins snapped a five-game losing streak in Cleveland.
Baldelli was especially pleased with Matthews, who allowed one run in 4 2/3 innings — one out shy of qualifying for a win.
“I think we have to reassess what’s a win because that should be a win,” Baldelli said. “He pitched great.”
Down 2-1, the Guardians got something going in the seventh when Manzardo led off with a single.
But pinch-runner Myles Straw, making his season debut after being selected from Triple-A Columbus before the game with All-Star Steven Kwan going on the IL, got picked off first by Ronny Henriquez.
Straw was initially called safe. But Baldelli challenged, and when the call was overturned, Straw had to jog back to the dugout in humiliation.
“I knew it was close,” Straw said. “I wasn’t sure if I was going to be out or safe. When he called me safe, I was pretty thankful. But then obviously Rocco challenged the play and it got overturned, so kind of sucked.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Footage of two New York City police officers opening fire at a subway station as they confronted a man holding a knife shows they shot at him as he was standing still, his arms by his side and his back to a train.
In the days since Sunday’s shooting, police officials have repeatedly emphasized that the officers fired after Derell Mickles “charged” at one of them, and when their attempts to deescalate the situation and use Tasers had failed — leaving them with little choice but to resort to deadly force to protect themselves and passengers. 
The footage, uploaded to the NYPD’s YouTube page Friday, offers a different view of the shooting that not only wounded Mickles but also a bystander, who was hit in the head with a stray bullet. Gregory Delpeche, 49, was sent to the hospital in critical condition, where doctors had to open up his skull to reduce brain swelling, according to his family.
“The NYPD’s version of events is a gross mischaracterization of what we see on that video,” said Nick Liakas, an attorney representing Delpeche’s family. “There was no need for any bullets to fly in the subway station, especially in a setting where the officers put innocent bystanders at risk. And it resulted in Gregory getting shot in the back of the head.”
Police officials defended the officers in a news conference Wednesday.
“It happened because an individual decided to enter our subway system. He refused to drop that weapon, after repeated orders by the officers. And then he advanced towards the officers while he was armed,” the NYPD interim commissioner, Thomas Donlon, said.


NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell described the shooting as a “tragic situation” and said “we did the best we could to protect our lives and the lives of people on that train.”
As Chell described it, Mickles jumped a turnstile at a subway station in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn a little after 3 p.m. Sunday. The two officers asked the 37-year-old Brooklyn native to leave, and he did, but Mickles was seen unfolding a knife on his way out.
When Mickles returned to the station a few minutes later, the officers followed him up the steps onto the elevated platform. In the body camera footage, they tell Mickles to drop the knife. Mickles, standing with his hands behind his back says, “I’m not dropping it, you’ll have to shoot me.” The officers repeatedly implore him to show them his hands. He tells them to leave him alone. 
When a train pulls into the station, Mickles backs onto it. The officers follow him on. They repeatedly say “put it down” and then fire their Tasers, which have little effect, embedding in Mickles’ T-shirt before he rips them out and walks off the train.
Now on the platform, Mickles holds the knife with the blade open. The officers follow him out from different doors, and Mickles runs in the direction of one officer, who runs backwards.
When the officers pull their guns, Mickles comes to a complete stop, his hands by his sides, in front of the train. As Mickles turns his head slightly to the left, they fire multiple shots. Mickles falls into train while the passengers inside flee.
In Chell’s telling on Wednesday, he said: “Mr. Mickles charged one of the officers and then turned around and the other officer was standing there within approximately 5 feet. It was at this time they both discharged their weapons.”
In addition to Mickles and Delpeche, one of the officers was wounded in the shooting. A 26-year-old woman suffered a graze wound.
Earlier Friday, Mickles, appearing remotely from his hospital bed, pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted aggravated assault on a police officer, menacing an officer, weapons possession and evading his subway fare. The judge set his bail at $200,000.
Mickles’ lawyer, Jonathan Fink, said his client is in “very bad shape” and unable to walk.
“It seems there’s a strong argument there was disproportionate force used by the police in this case,” said Fink, who had not yet seen the video.
Police reform advocates condemned the shooting.
“This horrific event that endangered dozens of transit users didn’t happen in a vacuum,” Loyda Colon, of the group Communities United for Police Reform, said in a statement Friday. “It happened because the mayor has invested in flooding officers into our subway system and communities to criminalize mental illness and poverty, rather than in making transit, housing, and services affordable and available to New Yorkers.”
Earlier in the week, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat and former police captain, said he’d seen the videos and that the officers should be commended for showing a “great level of restraint.”
“I saw the steps those police officers implemented,” Adams told reporters Tuesday. “Over and over again, trying to reason with the perpetrator. And so some people said, ‘Well, you shouldn’t be enforcing fare evasion.’ No. This is not a city where any and everything goes.”
After the footage was released, his office released a statement that was less effusive, noting that the NYPD’s initial review found that shooting took place after Mickles “brandished a dangerous weapon and put officers’ lives at risk.”
“While the formal review continues, and out of respect for that process, I will avoid commenting any further,” Adams said.

ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) — A French trading ship that sank in the 17th century with treasure onboard is being brought back to life in a workshop in Madagascar with every stroke of Rafah Ralahy’s small wood sander.
Ralahy, eyes sparkling behind his glasses, has learned in 30 years as a craftsman at the Le Village model ship making company that recreating history in miniature form can’t be rushed. It’ll take time to get the shape of the hull just right on this model, to get it just as it was on the 1,000-ton original.
The ship in question was called the Soleil d’Orient — the Eastern Sun — and it was one of the best in the French East India company. It sank in 1681 while carrying ambassadors and treasure sent by the King of Siam (now Thailand) to King Louis XIV of France. Anyone wanting an exact wooden replica from Le Village, albeit a few feet long, can get it for just over $2,500. That excludes the shipping costs.
“My job is to be as faithful as possible to the plan,” said 50-year-old Ralahy, referring to copies of the ships’ original building plans that Le Village acquires from maritime museums or other sources. “At each stage we check so that the model we create is identical to the ship designed centuries ago.”
Le Village has been making models of history’s most famous vessels since 1993 and sending them to collectors across the world, some of them eminent. Prince Albert of Monaco has several models displayed in his palace, said Le Village co-owner Grégory Postel. The Spanish royal family also own Le Village creations. Pope Francis was gifted a model by Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina.

Those royal customers are looking for a model ship “that resembles what their ancestors knew,” said Postel, championing the company’s attention to historic detail. Some of the high-end models sell for a princely sum of $10,000. Collectors with as much passion but less means can find something for around $150.
Le Village has dozens of ships available for order, from celebrated to infamous to ill-fated. Some recently were shown at an exhibition in Venice, Italy, including one of the company’s showpieces, the British ship HMS Bounty that is renowned for a mutiny by its disgruntled crew. A model of perhaps the most famous ship ever, the Titanic, is of course available.
Le Village’s staff of more than two dozen model makers work in nine dusty workshops on the outskirts of the Madagascar capital of Antananarivo. Like Ralahy, many of them have been here for more than 20 years, crafting a reputation for an unusual company.
Madagascar has hardly any shipbuilding tradition despite being the world’s fourth largest island. So, Le Village’s own story is one of endeavor.
It was started by Frenchman Hervé Scrive, who arrived in Madagascar off the east coast of Africa with a passion. He sold it after 20 years to a family, but it hit choppy waters during the COVID-19 pandemic as Madagascar — already struggling with high levels of poverty — sank into a deep economic recession.
Postel, his wife and another French couple bought it last year with the aim of bringing it out of financial trouble and, hopefully, expanding. Postel said they want to start a woodworking school to spread the craft on the island and create opportunities for others. They’d also like to build a maritime museum of their own.
Ralahy, a house painter as a young man before finding another use for his nimble hands, sands the rough wood that will become the outer hull of the Soleil d’Orient model he’s started. Weeks of intricate work lie ahead for the team of crafters and some models take more than 1,000 hours of work. But the miniature sails will be hoisted on a new Soleil d’Orient nearly 350 years after tragedy befell the original and she sank with no survivors, sending her treasure to the ocean bottom.
Each model passes through the different workshops and through the hands of different specialists. Husbands and wives work together at Le Village, as do other members of the same families. It’s a tight-knit team.
In another room, four women who craft and attach the tiny ropes, sails and other finishing touches, are working with a sense of urgency on one model. This one is nearing completion and has already been paid for.
“It’s a race,” said Alexandria Mandimbiherimamisoa as she gets mini flags ready to add to the ship. “We have to send the boat to its buyer in a week.”
Her husband, Tovo-Hery Andrianarivo, also works at Le Village, his fingernails blackened from a misplaced hammer blow or two over the years, an occupational hazard. He spoke of their collective pride when they see how far some of their models have traveled.
Andrianarivo once watched a documentary on the recreation of a life-size version of the Hermione, an 18th-century frigate that carried French General Lafayette to the American War of Independence. It was rebuilt and launched again in 2014 to much fanfare.
“Behind the museum curator who was speaking, there was our model,” Andrianarivo said. “The feeling I felt that day was incredible.”

FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — A judge in a rural Kentucky county was fatally shot in his courthouse chambers Thursday, and the local sheriff was charged with murder in the killing, police said.
The preliminary investigation indicates Letcher County Sheriff Shawn M. Stines shot District Judge Kevin Mullins multiple times following an argument inside the courthouse, according to Kentucky State Police. Mullins, who held the judgeship for 15 years, died at the scene, and Stines surrendered without incident.
The fatal shooting in Whitesburg sent shock waves through a tight-knit Appalachian town and county seat of government with about 1,700 residents located about 145 miles (235 kilometers) southeast of Lexington.
Lead county prosecutor Matt Butler described an outpouring of sympathy as he recused himself and his office from investigations in the shooting, citing social and family ties to Mullins.
“We all know each other here. ... Anyone from Letcher County would tell you that Judge Mullins and I married sisters and that we have children who are first cousins but act like siblings,” Butler said in statement from his office. “For that reason, among others, I have already taken steps to recuse myself and my entire office.”
Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said his office will collaborate with a commonwealth’s attorney in the region as special prosecutors in the criminal case.


“We will fully investigate and pursue justice,” Coleman said on social media.
Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Laurance B. VanMeter said he was “shocked by this act of violence” and that the court system was “shaken by this news.”
Letcher County’s judge-executive signed an order closing on Friday the county courthouse where the shooting took place.
Mullins, 54, was hit multiple times in the shooting, Kentucky State Police said. Stines, 43, was charged with one count of first-degree murder. The investigation is continuing, police said.
It was unclear whether Stines had an attorney. Kentucky State Police referred inquires about Stines’ legal representation Thursday to a spokesperson who did not immediately respond by email.
Responding to the shooting, Gov. Andy Beshear said in a social media post: “There is far too much violence in this world, and I pray there is a path to a better tomorrow.”
Mullins served as a district judge in Letcher County since he was appointed by former Gov. Steve Beshear in 2009 and elected the following year.
Mullins was known for promoting substance abuse treatment for people involved in the justice system and helped hundreds of residents enter inpatient residential treatment, according to a program for a drug summit he spoke at in 2022. Mullins also helped create a program offering courthouse peer support for addiction treatment and worked with various healthcare organizations and providers.
After the shooting, several area schools were briefly placed on lockdown.
This story was first published on Sep. 19, 2024. It was updated on Sep. 20, 2024 to remove an erroneous reference to Addiction Recovery Care, which operates a network of treatment centers across Kentucky. Mullins did not help found that company.",False

                Question: What is the percentage of the upfront pay raise included in Boeing's latest offer to striking machinists as of September 23, 2024?

Publication date:2024-09-23 07:00:00

Boeing said Monday it made a “best and final offer” to striking machinists that includes bigger raises and larger bonuses, but the workers’ union said the proposal isn’t good enough and there won’t be a ratification vote before Boeing’s deadline at the end of the week.
The union complained that Boeing publicized its latest offer to 33,000 striking workers without first bargaining with union negotiators.
“Boeing does not get to decide when or if you vote,” leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers district 751 told members Monday night. “The company has refused to meet for further discussion; therefore, we will not be voting” on Friday, as Boeing insisted.
Boeing said that after two days of talks last week with federal mediators failed to produce an agreement, “we presented a best and final offer that made significant improvements and addresses feedback from the union and our employees.”
The new offer is more generous than the one that was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month. The company said the offer includes pay raises of 30% over four years, up from 25% in the first proposal. The union originally demanded 40% over three years.
The new offer — and labeling it a final one — demonstrates Boeing’s eagerness to end the strike that began Sept. 13. The company introduced rolling furloughs of non-unionized employees last week to cut costs during the strike. 


The strikers face their own financial pressure to return to work. They received their final paychecks last week and will lose company-provided health insurance at the end of the month, according to Boeing.
The company said its new offer is contingent on members of the machinists’ union in the Pacific Northwest ratifying the contract by late Friday night, when the strike will be a little over two weeks old.
The union, which represents factory workers who assemble some of the company’s best-selling planes, waited several hours before pushing back Monday night.
“This proposal does not go far enough to address your concerns, and Boeing has missed the mark with this proposal,” the union told members. The group added that it will survey members about the new offer.
Boeing’s latest offer includes upfront pay raises of 12% plus three annual raises of 6% each.
It would double the size of ratification bonuses to $6,000. It also would keep annual bonuses based on productivity. In the rejected contract, Boeing sought to replace those payouts with new contributions to retirement accounts.
Boeing said average annual pay for machinists would rise from $75,608 now to $111,155 at the end of the four-year contract.
The new offer would not restore a traditional pension plan that Boeing eliminated about a decade ago. Striking workers cited pay and pensions as reasons why they voted 94.6% against the company’s previous offer.
Boeing also renewed a promise to build its next new airline plane in the Seattle area -- if that project starts in the next four years. That was a key provision for union leaders, who recommended adoption of the original contract offer, but one that seemed less persuasive to rank-and-file members.
The strike is likely already starting to reduce Boeing’s ability to generate cash. The company gets much of its cash when it delivers new planes, but the strike has shut down production of 737s, 777s and 767s. Work on 787s continues with nonunion workers in South Carolina.
On Friday, Boeing began requiring thousands of managers and nonunion employees to take one week off without pay every four weeks under the temporary rolling furloughs. It also has announced a hiring freeze, reduced business travel and decreased spending on suppliers.
The money-saving measures are expected to last as long as the strike continues.",False

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX launched a rescue mission for the two stuck astronauts at the International Space Station on Saturday, sending up a downsized crew to bring them home but not until next year.
The capsule rocketed into orbit to fetch the test pilots whose Boeing spacecraft returned to Earth empty earlier this month because of safety concerns. The switch in rides left it to NASA’s Nick Hague and Russia’s Alexander Gorbunov to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. 
Because NASA rotates space station crews approximately every six months, this newly launched flight with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams won’t return until late February. Officials said there wasn’t a way to bring them back earlier on SpaceX without interrupting other scheduled missions.
By the time they return, the pair will have logged more than eight months in space. They expected to be gone just a week when they signed up for Boeing’s first astronaut flight that launched in June.
NASA ultimately decided that Boeing’s Starliner was too risky after a cascade of thruster troubles and helium leaks marred its trip to the orbiting complex. The space agency cut two astronauts from this SpaceX launch to make room on the Dragon capsule’s return leg for Wilmore and Williams.
Wilmore and Williams watched the liftoff via a live link sent to the space station, prompting a cheer of “Go Dragon!” from Williams, NASA deputy program manager Dina Contella said.


Williams has been promoted to commander of the space station, which will soon be back to its normal population of seven. Once Hague and Gorbunov arrive on Sunday, four astronauts living there since March can leave in their own SpaceX capsule. Their homecoming was delayed a month by Starliner’s turmoil.
Hague noted before the flight that change is the one constant in human spaceflight.
“There’s always something that is changing. Maybe this time it’s been a little more visible to the public,” he said.
Hague was thrust into the commander’s job for the rescue mission based on his experience and handling of a launch emergency six years ago. The Russian rocket failed shortly after liftoff, and the capsule carrying him and a cosmonaut catapulted off the top to safety.
Rookie NASA astronaut Zena Cardman and veteran space flier Stephanie Wilson were pulled from this flight after NASA opted to go with SpaceX to bring the stuck astronauts home. Promised a future space mission, both were at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, taking part in the launch livestream. Gorbunov remained on the flight under an exchange agreement between NASA and the Russian Space Agency.
“Every crewed launch that I have ever watched has really brought me a lot of emotion. This one today was especially unique,” a teary-eyed Cardman said following the early afternoon liftoff. “It was hard not to watch that rocket lift off without thinking, ‘That’s my rocket and that’s my crew.’ ”
Moments before liftoff, Hague paid tribute to his two colleagues left behind: “Unbreakable. We did it together.” Once in orbit, he called it a ”sweet ride” and thanked everyone who made it possible.
Earlier, Hague acknowledged the challenges of launching with half a crew and returning with two astronauts trained on another spacecraft. 
“We’ve got a dynamic challenge ahead of us,” Hague said after arriving from Houston last weekend. “We know each other and we’re professionals and we step up and do what’s asked of us.”
SpaceX has long been the leader in NASA’s commercial crew program, established as the space shuttles were retiring more than a decade ago. SpaceX beat Boeing in delivering astronauts to the space station in 2020, and it is now up to 10 crew flights for NASA.
Boeing has struggled with a variety of issues over the years, repeating a Starliner test flight with no one on board after the first one veered off course. The Starliner that left Wilmore and Williams in space landed without any issues in the New Mexico desert on Sept. 6, and has since returned to Kennedy Space Center. A week ago, Boeing’s defense and space chief was replaced.
Delayed by Hurricane Helene pounding Florida, the latest SpaceX liftoff marked the first for astronauts from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. SpaceX took over the old Titan rocket pad nearly two decades ago and used it for satellite and station cargo launches, while flying crews from Kennedy’s former Apollo and shuttle pad next door. The company wanted more flexibility as more Falcon rockets soared.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes across Gaza overnight and Wednesday hit a U.N. school sheltering displaced Palestinian families as well as two homes, killing at least 34 people, including 19 women and children, hospital officials said. A U.N. official said six staffers were among the dead.
The war in Gaza is now into its 11th month, with tens of thousands of people dead, and international efforts to mediate a cease-fire between Israel and the Hamas militant group have repeatedly stalled as they accuse each other of making additional and unacceptable demands.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops launched raids in several towns backed by airstrikes, continuing a crackdown across the territory that the military says is targeting militants but has wrecked neighborhoods and killed civilians. One airstrike killed five people the military said were militants threatening its troops. A second strike on a car killed at least three people, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.
An attacker crashed a fuel truck into a West Bank bus stop near the Israeli settlement of GIvat Assaf, killing an Israeli soldier, the military said. Officials said soldiers and an armed civilian “neutralized” the attacker.
The strike on the U.N.’s al-Jaouni Preparatory Boys School in the Nuseirat refugee camp killed at least 14, including two children and a woman, officials from Awda and al-Aqsa Martyrs hospitals said. At least 18 other people were wounded, they said.


The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas militants planning attacks from inside the school. The claim could not be independently confirmed.
One of the children killed was the daughter of Momin Selmi, a member of Gaza’s civil defense agency, which rescues wounded and retrieves bodies after strikes, the agency said.
Gaza’s schools are packed with tens of thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes by Israeli offensives and evacuation orders. The al-Jaouni school, one of many in Gaza run by the U.N. agency for Palestinians, or UNWRA, has been hit by multiple strikes during the war. 
UNRWA said six staffers aiding the displaced, including the manager of the shelter, were killed. “Humanitarian staff, premises & operations have been blatantly & unabatedly disregarded since the beginning of the war,” the agency’s director, Philippe Lazzarini, wrote on X.
Israel frequently bombs schools, saying they are being used by Hamas militants. It blames Hamas for civilian casualties from its strikes, saying its fighters base themselves and operate within dense residential neighborhoods.
More than 90% of Gaza’s school buildings have been severely or partially damaged in strikes, and more than half the schools housing displaced people have been hit, according to a survey in July by the Education Cluster, a collection of aid groups led by UNICEF and Save the Children.
Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,084 Palestinians and wounded another 95,029, the territory’s Health Ministry said. The ministry’s count does not differentiate between civilians and militants. Israel launched its campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others.
Earlier Wednesday, a strike hit a home near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing 11 people, including six brothers and sisters ranging from 21 months to 21 years old, according to the European Hospital, which received the casualties.
A strike late Tuesday on a home in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza killed nine people, including six women and children, according to the Health Ministry and the civil defense. The civil defense said the home belonged to Akram al-Najjar, a professor at the al-Quds Open University, who survived.
The Israeli military said two soldiers died and seven were injured when their helicopter crashed in southern Gaza as they evacuated wounded troops. It said the overnight crash was not the result of enemy fire and is under investigation. There have been 340 Israeli soldiers killed since the ground operation began in Gaza in late October, at least 50 of whom died in accidents, according to the military.
The West Bank also has seen a surge in violence. Israel has stepped up its military raids there, saying it is working to dismantle militant groups and prevent increasing militant attacks on Israelis. Palestinians say such operations are aimed at cementing Israel’s seemingly open-ended military rule over the territory. At the same time, Jewish settlers have accelerated attacks on Palestinians.
The military on Wednesday said it launched assaults around the West Bank town of Tulkarem and in two northern towns. It said it dismantled an explosives lab, a weapons manufacturing workshop and an explosives-rigged vehicle. The military said an airstrike backing troops operating in the town of Tubas killed five militants. The Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed five were killed but did not specify if they were militants or civilians.
The Red Crescent said three people were killed in a strike on a car in a village outside Tulkarem. The military confirmed it carried out a strike there but had no immediate details.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It took Derek Carr and the Saints’ new offense one series to produce a touchdown on an explosive play — and one half to score 30 points.
New Orleans’ defense didn’t look too bad, either.
Carr passed for three touchdowns and the New Orleans Saints scored on their first nine possessions in a 47-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.
“That was a fun way to start the season,” said Carr, who got booed in the Superdome at times last season, but heard only rousing applause this time. “They liked us a lot today. That was nice.”
Alvin Kamara and Jamaal Williams each ran for touchdowns and Blake Grupe kicked four field goals — two from beyond 50 yards — in an extraordinary debut for new Saints offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak. His first game calling plays resulted in the most points the Saints have ever scored in a season opener.
“That’s what we made some changes for,” Kamara said. “I’ve been here a while and I know what it’s supposed to feel like — and it felt good today.”
The Panthers, who went 2-15 last season, made front office, coaching and key roster changes in hopes of improving this season. But this season opener could not have gone much worse for new coach Dave Canales and second-year quarterback Bryce Young.
“The nature of the loss matters, but whether it was by three points or as much as it was today, you have to just count them as a loss and then move forward to the next challenge,” Canales said. “In weeks from now, it’s not going to matter what the score was.”


Young was 13 of 30 passing for 161 yards and was intercepted twice — once each by safeties Will Harris and Jordan Howden.

The Saints profited from another turnover when safety Tyrann Matthieu forced and recovered a fumble by receiver Jonathan Mingo.
“Everyone’s going to want to talk about how exciting it was for your offense. But our defense gave us a lot of short fields,” Carr said. “Them setting us up with short fields and us executing allows a day like that to happen.”
Young was sacked three times by defensive back Alontae Taylor and once by linebacker Demario Davis. 
Carr was 19 of 23 for 200 yards, highlighted by his 59-yard touchdown pass to Rashid Shaheed on the game’s opening series. Carr also found tight ends Foster Moreau and Juwan Johnson for touchdowns of three and 16 yards, the latter putting New Orleans up 30-0 before Carolina scored its first points on a field goal as the first half ended.
Johnson also got a hand on a Johnny Hekker punt that went just 11 yards, setting up the Saints on the Panthers’ 36. Williams’ 14-yard, fourth-quarter TD run came two plays later.
Kamara finished with 83 yards rushing and 27 receiving for his 50th game with at least 100 yards from scrimmage.
Young scored the Panthers’ lone touchdown on a three-yard scramble in the third quarter.
“This doesn’t define us,” Young said. “It’s a long year.”
The Saints were founded in 1967 and Taylor became the first New Orleans defensive back to record as many as three sacks in a game.
“That’s just Week 1, though. So, plenty more to come,” Taylor said. “Someone told me as I was coming off the field, ‘Sacks get you paid just like interceptions get you paid.”
Saints coach Dennis Allen, who calls defensive plays, has wanted to develop Taylor as a blitzer because “he’s fast. That would be No. 1. And he’s aggressive.”
“It’s one thing to say that you’re going to send somebody on a pressure, but they’ve got to be willing to go in and deal with the noise that’s in there,” Allen continued. “There’s big, 300-pound offensive linemen and things of that nature.”
Saints: Left guard Lucas Patrick left the game with a toe injury in the first half. Cornerback Marshon Lattimore left with a hamstring injury. ... Moreau was pulled from the game with concussion symptoms after a first-down catch in the fourth quarter.
Panthers: Host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.
Saints: Visit Dallas on Sunday.

COMO, Italy (AP) — Former France and Real Madrid center back Raphael Varane announced his retirement on Wednesday, ending a career that included a World Cup title and a big haul of club trophies.
The 31-year-old Varane signed with promoted Serie A club Como in July but injured his knee during his only appearance with the club — an Italian Cup match against Sampdoria last month.
“In my career I have taken on many challenges, rose to occasion after occasion, almost all of it was supposed to be impossible,” Varane wrote on Instagram. “Reflecting on these moments, it is with immense pride and a feeling of fulfillment that I am announcing my retirement from the game that we all love.”
Varane was arguably the tournament’s standout defender when France won the 2018 World Cup in Russia, where he scored the most important of his five international goals with a header against Uruguay in the quarterfinals. 
An elegant, ball-playing defender with excellent positional sense thanks to his quick reading of the game, Varane formed a solid center back pairing with Samuel Umtiti in that tournament. 
He also helped Madrid to four Champions League titles and three Spanish league trophies.
He moved to Manchester United in 2021 but was restricted to 95 appearances in his three seasons in England — mainly because of injuries.
Varane began his career at Lens.
“From Lens to Madrid to Manchester, and playing for our national team. I have defended every badge with everything I have, and loved every minute of the journey,” Varane said. “I have no regrets, I wouldn’t change a thing. I have won more than I could have even dreamed of.”


Varane had already retired from France’s national team, a few months after the World Cup final defeat to Argentina in 2022. During that match, his 93rd for Les Bleus after making his debut in 2013, he fell to the ground exhausted deep into extra time.
Over the years he became one of the main leaders in the France team under coach Didier Deschamps, along with goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, midfielder Paul Pogba and forward Antoine Griezmann. 
“Knowing him, I know that this decision, which is always difficult to take, came after mature reflection,” Deschamps said. “It’s therefore the right decision, which we must respect. Speed, vision, technique, mental strength, Raphaël had all the right qualities to achieve the magnificent career that was his.”
Varane played a total of 22 matches in major tournaments.
“I will remember a player who was focused on others and on the team. He had a perfect rapport with captain Hugo Lloris,” Deschamps said. “In the national team, and wherever he went, he always left the impression of being a great professional.”
Varane said he would remain at Como: “Just without using my boots and shin pads. Something I am looking forward to sharing more about soon.”
Como got its first Serie A victory in more than 21 years when coach Cesc Fabregas’ team won 3-2 at Atalanta on Tuesday. ___

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A huge king penguin chick named Pesto, who weighs as much as both his parents combined, has become a social media celebrity and a star attraction at an Australian aquarium.

Weighing 22 kilograms (49 pounds) at 9 months old, Pesto is the heaviest penguin chick the Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium has ever had, its education supervisor Jacinta Early said on Friday.

By contrast, his doting parents, Hudson and Tango weigh 11 kilograms (24 pounds) each.

Pesto’s global fame has grown with his size. More than 1.9 billion people around the world had viewed him through social media, an aquarium statement said.

He ate more than his own substantial body weight in fish in the past week: 24 kilograms (53 pounds), Early said.

The veterinary advice is that that quantity of food is healthy for a chick approaching adulthood.

His growth will plateau as he enters his fledging period. He has started to lose his brown feathers and will replace them with the black and white plumage of a young adult.

His keepers expect him to trim down to around 15 kilograms (33 pounds) in the process.

“He’s going to start losing that really adorable baby fluff. It might take him one to two months to really get rid of it. Then he’ll be nice and sleek and streamlined,” Early said.

But she expects Pesto will remain recognizable as the sought-after TikTok celebrity he has become for another two weeks.



For now, he’s a star attraction.

“Such a small head for such a big body,” one admirer remarked on Friday as a crowd gathered against the glass of the penguin enclosure at feeding time.

Hatching on Jan. 31, Pesto was the only king penguin chick to hatch at the aquarium this year and the first since 2022, a year when there were six. The reason why there was none last year isn’t clear.

Adult king penguins weigh between 9.5 kilograms (21 pounds) and 18 kilograms (40 pounds), according to the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, a global environmental group.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump launched his family’s cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, with an interview on the X social media platform in which he also gave his first public comments on the apparent assassination attempt against him a day earlier.
Trump did not discuss specifics about World Liberty Financial on Monday or how it would work, pivoting from questions about cryptocurrency to talking about artificial intelligence or other topics. Instead, he recounted his experience Sunday, saying he and a friend playing golf “heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five.”
“I would have loved to have sank that last putt,” Trump said. He credited the Secret Service agent who spotted the barrel of a rifle and began firing toward it as well as law enforcement and a civilian who he said helped track down the suspect.
World Liberty Financial is expected to be a borrowing and lending service used to trade cryptocurrencies, which are forms of digital money that can be traded over the internet without relying on the global banking system. Exchanges often charge fees for withdrawals of Bitcoin and other currencies.
Other speakers after Trump, including his eldest son, Don Jr., talked about embracing cryptocurrency as an alternative to what they allege is a banking system tilted against conservatives. 


Experts have said a presidential candidate launching a business venture in the midst of a campaign could create ethical conflicts.
“Taking a pro-crypto stance is not necessarily troubling; the troubling aspect is doing it while starting a way to personally benefit from it,” Jordan Libowitz, a spokesperson for the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said earlier this month.
During his time in the White House, Trump said he was “not a fan” of cryptocurrency and tweeted in 2019, “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” However, during this election cycle, he has reversed himself and taken on a favorable view of cryptocurrencies. 
He announced in May that his campaign would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency as part of an effort to build what it calls a “crypto army” leading up to Election Day. He attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville this year, promising to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” and create a bitcoin “strategic reserve” using the currency that the government currently holds.
Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who has done research on cryptocurrencies, said she was skeptical of Trump’s change of heart on crypto.
“I think it’s fair to say that that reversal has been motivated in part by financial interests,” she said.
Crypto enthusiasts welcomed the shift, viewing the launch as a positive sign for investors if Trump retakes the White House. 
Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has not offered policy proposals on how it would regulate digital assets like cryptocurrencies.
In an effort to appeal to crypto investors, a group of Democrats, including Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, participated in an online “Crypto 4 Harris” event in August.
Neither Harris nor members of her campaign staff attended the event.

A 10th person has died in the listeria outbreak that shuttered a Boar’s Head deli meat plant, federal health officials said Wednesday. 
At least 59 people in 19 states have been sickened by the bacteria first detected in liverwurst made at the Jarratt, Virginia, plant. Illnesses were reported between late May and late August, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. All of those who fell ill were hospitalized. 
The latest fatality was reported in New York, bringing the total deaths to two each in New York and South Carolina and one each in Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee and New Mexico.
The Sarasota, Florida-based company announced on Sept. 13 that it was closing the Jarratt plant and discontinuing production of liverwurst. The moves came after inspection reports revealed problems including mold, insects, dripping water and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment dating back at least two years. 
Boar’s Head faces multiple lawsuits related to the deaths and illnesses. 
The plant hasn’t operated since late July, when officials with the U.S. Agriculture Department suspended inspections and the firm recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli meats because of potential contamination. 
Boar’s Head officials have said they “regret and deeply apologize” for contamination in their products. 
Listeria infections are caused by a hardy type of bacteria that can survive and even thrive during refrigeration. An estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC. Infections can be hard to pinpoint because symptoms may occur up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food.

AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Kip Lewis returned an interception 61 yards for the game-winning touchdown, and No. 21 Oklahoma rallied from an 11-point fourth-quarter deficit to defeat Auburn, 27-21 on Saturday for its first-ever Southeastern Conference win.
“That was my first experience with Sooner magic as a head coach,” Oklahoma coach Brent Venables said. “That was an amazing last four drives on offense and defense. ... We played our best ball when it mattered most.”
It was Oklahoma’s first SEC road game after leaving the Big 12. The Sooners bounced back from a loss at home to Tennessee the previous week in their SEC opener.
True freshman quarterback Michael Hawkins Jr. gained 230 yards of total offense in his first career start for Oklahoma after replacing Jackson Arnold during the Tennessee game.
The Sooners (4-1, 1-1 SEC) struggled on offense for much of this game, but they took advantage of several missed opportunities by the Tigers (2-3, 0-2). Oklahoma stopped Auburn on fourth down at the 1-yard line in the first quarter, and the Tigers missed two chances at a short field goal late in the second quarter. 
Auburn’s Payton Thorne passed for 338 yards and three touchdowns, but his sixth interception of the season turned out to be the decisive play.
“I’ve got to make sure that (Thorne) understands the situation better, and we should’ve had runs there,” Auburn coach Hugh Freeze said. “I have to be clearer with him on what we have to do there.”


Oklahoma’s Jovantae Barnes cut into Auburn’s 21-10 lead with 8:32 remaining with a 2-yard touchdown run that was set up by a 60-yard pass from Hawkins to J.J. Hester. The 2-point conversion failed, leaving the Tigers ahead by five points.
Lewis then intercepted Thorne, who was making his return to the starting lineup after a two-game absence, and ran it all the way back with 4:06 left to play.
After a late Oklahoma field goal extended the visitors’ lead to six points, Thorne’s last-second pass came up short of the end zone. 
Auburn finished the game with nearly 200 more yards of offense than Oklahoma.
“We didn’t play very well,” Venables said. “But we played amazingly when we needed to.”
Oklahoma: The Sooners’ slow offensive start, marked by a large number of injuries at wide receiver and inconsistent line play, continued Saturday. But Hawkins could provide a real spark going forward with his dual-threat ability alongside what has been a strong defense under Venables so far this season.
Auburn: Penalties, questionable clock management and empty scoring drives continue to haunt the Tigers, who have lost all three of their home games against power-conference opponents this season. Now Auburn will start the toughest stretch of its schedule with a losing record.
After a 22-yard run from Jarquez Hunter with a little more than 11 minutes remaining and a two-score lead, Thorne threw back-to-back incompletions before a run for no gain. That led to a missed 51-yard field goal. 
The possession only took 1:31 off the clock, and it opened the door for Oklahoma’s rally.
Oklahoma will have a good chance to climb back into the Top 20 with this road comeback win.
Oklahoma: Has an off week before facing No. 1 Texas in Dallas on Oct. 12.
Auburn: Visits No. 2 Georgia next Saturday.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Panthers will be without wide receiver Adam Thielen for at least four weeks after the veteran was placed on injured reserve Tuesday with a hamstring injury.
Thielen was injured while extending to make a diving touchdown catch near the end of the second quarter of Carolina’s 36-22 win over the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. The 34-year-old did not return in the second half.
Jonathan Mingo, a second-round pick in 2023, or rookie first-round pick Xavier Legette will likely replace Thielen in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Panthers host the Cincinnati Bengals.
Thielen had eight catches for 109 yards in three games.
His loss is a big blow to an offense that broke out in its first game with Andy Dalton at quarterback. Dalton replaced 2023 No. 1 overall pick Bryce Young, who struggled in two starts this season and is 2-16 as an NFL starter.
The Panthers have free agent wide receiver Jalen Coker to replace Thielen on the roster.
Carolina also signed defensive backs Demani Richardson and Russ Yeast, placed backup defensive back Jordan Fuller on injured reserve and waived tight end Messiah Swinson.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The U.S. military has moved about 130 soldiers along with mobile rocket launchers to a desolate island in the Aleutian chain of western Alaska amid a recent increase in Russian military planes and vessels approaching American territory.
Eight Russian military planes and four navy vessels, including two submarines, have come close to Alaska in the past week as Russia and China conducted joint military drills. None of the planes breached U.S. airspace and a Pentagon spokesperson said Tuesday there was no cause for alarm.
“It’s not the first time that we’ve seen the Russians and the Chinese flying, you know, in the vicinity, and that’s something that we obviously closely monitor, and it’s also something that we’re prepared to respond to,” Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a news conference.
As part of a “force projection operation,” the Army on Sept. 12 sent the soldiers to Shemya Island, some 1,200 miles (1,930 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage, where the U.S. Air Force maintains an air station that dates to World War II. The soldiers brought two High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, with them. 
U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said the U.S. military also deployed a guided missile destroyer and a Coast Guard vessel to the western region of Alaska as Russia and China began the “Ocean-24” military exercises in the Pacific and Arctic oceans Sept. 10.
The North American Aerospace Defense Command said it detected and tracked Russian military planes operating off Alaska over a four-day span. There were two planes each on Sept. 11, Sept. 13, Sept. 14 and Sept. 15.


The planes operated in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone, a zone beyond U.S. sovereign airspace, but within which the U.S. expects aircraft to identify themselves, NORAD said.
The Russian Embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
NORAD has said the number of such incursions has fluctuated yearly. The average was six to seven intercepts a year. Last year, 26 Russian planes came into the Alaska zone, and so far this year, there have been 25.
Often in such encounters, the military provides photos of the Russian warplanes being escorted by either U.S. or Canadian planes, such as during a July 24 intercept of two Russian and two Chinese planes. However, none was released in the past week and a NORAD spokeswoman, Canadian Maj. Jennie Derenzis, declined to say whether jets were scrambled to intercept the Russian planes.
The U.S. Coast Guard said Sunday its homeland security vessel, the 418-foot (127-meter) Stratton, was on routine patrol in the Chukchi Sea when it tracked four Russian Federation Navy vessels about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Point Hope, Alaska.
The Russian vessels, which included two submarines, a frigate and a tugboat, had crossed the maritime boundary into U.S. waters to avoid sea ice, which is permitted under international rules and customs.
Two years ago, a U.S. Coast Guard ship about 85 miles (137 kilometers) north of Alaska’s Kiska Island in the Bering Sea came across three Chinese and four Russian naval vessels sailing in single formation.
Ryder, the Pentagon spokesperson, said the recent spike is “something that we’ll continue to keep an eye on, but doesn’t pose a threat from our perspective.”
Sullivan called for a larger military presence in the Aleutians while advocating for the U.S. to respond with strength to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
“In the past two years, we’ve seen joint Russian-Chinese air and naval exercises off our shores and a Chinese spy balloon floating over our communities,” Sullivan said in a statement Tuesday. “These escalating incidents demonstrate the critical role the Arctic plays in great power competition between the U.S., Russia, and China.”
Sullivan said the U.S. Navy should reopen its shuttered base at Adak, located in the Aleutians. Naval Air Facility Adak was closed in 1997.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Former Venezuelan presidential candidate Edmundo González arrived in Spain on Sunday after fleeing into exile in as part of a negotiated deal with Nicolás Maduro’s government that dealt a major blow to millions who placed their hopes in his opposition campaign.
The surprise departure of the man considered by Venezuela’s opposition and several foreign governments to be the legitimate winner of July 28 presidential election was announced late Saturday by Venezuelan officials who just a few days ago ordered his arrest.
González landed Sunday at a military airport near Madrid, accompanied by his wife and Spanish officials. Hours later, he sent a short voice message to supporters thanking them for their support.
“My departure from Caracas was surrounded by acts of pressure, coercion and threats,” he said. “I trust that we will soon continue our fight to achieve our freedom and the restoration of Venezuela’s democracy.”
Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado tried to put a positive spin on his departure, assuring Venezuelans the 75-year-old retired diplomat would be back on Jan. 10 for a swearing-in ceremony marking the start of the next presidential term.
“His life was in danger, and the increasing threats, summons, arrest warrants and even attempts at blackmail and coercion to which he has been subjected, demonstrate that the regime has no scruples,” Machado said on X. “Let this be very clear to everyone: Edmundo will fight from outside alongside our diaspora.”
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024
But on the streets of Caracas on Sunday the mood was one of despair at the loss of someone who, against the odds, reignited a movement to end more than two decades of single party rule.


“What little hope we had left, it went with him,” said Laura Vargas, as she scrolled through the news on her cellphone while sitting on a park bench.
González joins the swelling ranks of opposition stalwarts who once fought Maduro only to throw in the towel and seek asylum abroad in the face of a brutal crackdown. In Spain, he joins at least four former presidential hopefuls who were imprisoned or faced arrest for defying Maduro’s rule.
Ever since the vote, he and Machado have been in hiding as security forces rounded up more than 2,000 people, many of them young Venezuelans who spontaneously took to the streets to protest Maduro’s alleged theft of the election.
Venezuelan officials have yet to comment. Vice President Delcy Rodríguez said in a statement late Saturday that the government decided to grant González safe passage out of the country to help restore “the country’s political peace and tranquility.”
Spain’s center-left government said the decision to leave Venezuela was González’s alone, and he departed on a plane sent by the country’s air force. González had sought refuge in the Dutch ambassador’s residence in Caracas after the election, the Netherlands’ government said Sunday, as he secretly negotiated his exit.
Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares told Spanish broadcaster RTVE that his government will grant González political asylum as he requested.
“Of course, I told him we were pleased that he is well and on his way to Spain, and I reiterated the commitment of our government to the political rights of all Venezuelans,” Albares said while en route to China for a state visit with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.
The European Union’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister, described González’s departure as “a sad day for democracy in Venezuela.”
Referring to González as the apparent winner of the presidential elections, Borrell in a statement said the ”EU will maintain its support of the Venezuelan people in their democratic aspirations.”
González was a last-minute stand-in after Machado was banned from running. Previously unknown to most Venezuelans, he nonetheless rapidly galvanized the hopes of millions of Venezuelans desperate for change after a decade-long economic free fall.
While Maduro was declared the winner of the July vote, most Western governments, including Spain, have yet to recognize his victory and are instead demanding that authorities publish a breakdown of votes. Meanwhile, tally sheets collected by opposition volunteers from over two-thirds of the electronic voting machines indicate that González won by a more than 2-to-1 margin.
The tally sheets have long been considered the ultimate proof of election results in Venezuela. In previous presidential elections, the National Electoral Council published online the results of each of the more than 30,000 voting machines, but the Maduro-controlled panel did not release any data this time, blaming an alleged cyberattack mounted by opponents from North Macedonia.
Attorney General Tarek William Saab, a staunch Maduro ally, sought González’s arrest after he failed to appear three times in connection with a criminal investigation into what it considers an act of electoral sabotage.
Saab told reporters that the voting records the opposition shared online were forged and an attempt to undermine the National Electoral Council. On Wednesday, González’s attorney delivered a letter to Saab in which he seemed to distance himself from the opposition’s publication of the voting records, saying it wasn’t his responsibility.
Experts from the United Nations and the Carter Center, which observed the election at the invitation of Maduro’s government, determined the results announced by electoral authorities lacked credibility. In a statement critical of the election, the U.N. experts stopped short of validating the opposition’s claim to victory, but they said the voting records it published online appear to exhibit all of the original security features.
Spain has been a major point of exodus for Venezuelans, particularly those leading opposition to Maduro’s regime. They include Leopoldo López, who fled to Spain to reunite with his family in 2020, and Antonio Ledezma, who left in 2017.
Some 44,000 Venezuelans immigrated to Spain in the first six months of this year. The last government statistics from 2022 said that some 212,000 Venezuelans lived in Spain.
“The truth is he’s more useful fighting abroad than in hiding or imprisoned,” said Gustavo Tovar-Arroyo, a human rights activist who was himself forced to flee into exile in 2012.

Florida State fell out of The Associated Press college football poll on Tuesday after starting the season 0-2, becoming just the third team to go from preseason top 10 to unranked in the first regular-season poll since the rankings expanded to 25 in 1989.
Georgia remained No. 1, receiving 57 first-place votes after starting the season with a blowout of then-No. 14 Clemson. The Tigers hung on at No. 25, but it was the second straight year they dropped at least 10 spots after losing their season opener.
Ohio State was No. 2 with five first-place votes. No. 3 Texas and No. 4 Alabama each moved up a spot, putting three Southeastern Conference teams in the top four along with Georgia. The last time the SEC did that in a non-pandemic season was Sept. 22, 2019.
No. 5 Notre Dame jumped two spots after opening the season with a victory at then-No. 20 Texas A&M, which fell out of the rankings.
Florida State has been the early season’s major disappointment. The defending Atlantic Coast Conference champion lost in Dublin, Ireland, to ACC rival Georgia Tech and then dropped another league game Monday night at home to Boston College.
No other preseason Top 25 team this year lost to an unranked opponent to open the season. Florida State did it twice as a double-digit favorite and did not receive a single vote from the AP poll panel.
The other preseason top-10 teams to fall all the way out of the Top 25 after Week 1 in the past 35 years were Michigan in 2007 after famously losing to Appalachian State as No. 5 and Clemson in 2008. The Tigers were No. 9 but opened with a blowout loss to Alabama and tumbled out of the rankings.


Mississippi remained at No. 6. Oregon slipped four spots to No. 7 after winning a close game with Idaho. Penn State stayed at No. 8. Missouri moved up two spots to No. 9 to give the SEC five teams in the top 10. Michigan dropped one spot to No. 10.
Georgia Tech’s 2-0 start has the No. 23 Yellow Jackets ranked for the first time since 2015.
Because Florida State started its season a week before most of the country, it moves into an exclusive club of teams that began their seasons 0-2 with each loss coming while ranked in the top 10.
Notre Dame was the last to do it in 2022, when the Fighting Irish began the season No. 5, lost at No. 2 Ohio State in their opener, and then were beaten at home the next week by Marshall while ranked eighth. The Irish went to on finish 9-4.
Ohio State opened the 1986 season ranked ninth and lost back-to-back games to ranked opponents, No. 5 Alabama and No. 17 Washington. The Buckeyes were No. 10 when they played the Huskies. Ohio State finished 10-3.
The 1967 Texas team and TCU from 1952 also started 0-2 while ranked in the top 10 in both games.
Florida State is only the second ranked team to lose twice before the first regular-season poll was released, joining Kentucky in 1951. The Wildcats went from No. 6 to No. 17 while going 1-2 to start the season, losing at No. 11 Texas and at Mississippi.
Florida State gets a weekend off before resuming its schedule with home games against Memphis and new ACC member California before a trip to SMU followed by a home game against Clemson.
“You’ve got a football team that nobody envisioned ever being where we are and having disappointment, having failure, but I do believe in what this team can do,” coach Mike Norvell said after the BC loss. “I believe in what this team can accomplish.”
The big movers upward in the Top 25 were Miami and Southern California.
The Hurricanes jumped seven spots to No. 12 after routing Florida at The Swamp and have their best ranking since cracking the top 10 late in the 2020 season.
No. 13 USC moved up 10 places after beating LSU with a late touchdown Sunday night in Las Vegas. LSU dropped to No. 18.
The Trojans started last season at No. 6, but ended up unranked after a disappointing 8-5 season with 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams.
The only other team to move into the rankings this week, along with Georgia Tech, was fellow ACC school Louisville. The Cardinals were among the top unranked voter-getters in the preseason and now sit at No. 22.
Despite Florida State and Clemson starting the season 0-3, the ACC has one more team in this week’s rankings than it did last time:
SEC — 8 (Nos. 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 14, 16, 18).
Big Ten — 6 (Nos. 2, 7, 8, 10, 13, 21).
ACC — 5 (Nos. 12, 22, 23, 24, 25).
Big 12 — 5 (Nos. 11, 16, 17, 19, 20).
Independent — 1 (No. 5).
No. 3 Texas at No. 10 Michigan. The first regular-season meeting ever is a top-10 matchup at the Big House.
No. 14 Tennessee vs. No. 24 N.C. State in Charlotte, North Carolina. Interesting SEC-ACC ranked matchup.

CINCINNATI (AP) — Ja’Marr Chase’s holdout and limited preseason practice time were hardly the only issues for the Cincinnati Bengals in their dud of a season opener.
Chase took the field Sunday against the New England Patriots after leaving everyone guessing about whether he would. The star receiver missed all of training camp while pursuing a lucrative contract extension.
But turnovers and poor tackling were just as responsible for the Bengals’ 16-10 loss to the Patriots, their latest poor start to a season under coach Zac Taylor.
“I felt ready enough,” said Chase, who had six catches for 62 yards. “Just wish we had more opportunities to make plays. Turnovers and we’ve got to get first downs and move the ball. We just have to forget about it and move on to next week.”
With a game at Super Bowl champion Kansas City up next, the Bengals face the possibility of starting 0-2 for a third straight season. 
Taylor, in his sixth season, started 0-11 in his first year, a rebuilding season the year before drafting Joe Burrow No. 1 overall. The Bengals’ best two-game start under Taylor is 1-1. 
The Bengals allowed 170 yards on the ground and had two critical fumbles Sunday. Burrow is fully healthy but finished an underwhelming 21 of 29 for 164 yards. He was sacked three times.
Cincinnati had the ball with a chance to tie or win the game with 3:04 remaining but failed to get a first down and elected to punt with three timeouts left. The Patriots got two first downs to run out the clock. 


“I missed Ja’Marr on the first play, I missed Zack (Moss) on the check-down on the second play, then they got us playing a coverage I didn’t expect on third down,” Burrow said. “Not my best drive. Not our best day. I just have to watch the tape.”

Burrow said he learned on Sunday that Chase was going to play after the star receiver recovered from a case of food poisoning earlier in the week.
Chase’s longest reception went for 28 yards. Burrow said the lack of deep targets to Chase didn’t have as much to do with their lack of time together in camp and more to do with the Patriots’ defensive scheme.
“They were taking it away,” Burrow said. “They did a good job. They had a good plan. I was just taking what they gave me. We will watch the tape and see if we had some other opportunities to get the ball down the field.”
Last season, the Bengals didn’t play their starters in any preseason games. This year, Burrow and the first-team offense played one series in the preseason opener against Tampa Bay. Such an approach isn’t unusual, but the Bengals also had to deal with the distraction surrounding Chase’s desire for an extension, which still hasn’t been resolved.
“I will leave his business to him,” Burrow said. “It was great to have him out there. I thought he played well.”
More salient to the Bengals’ loss were fumbles by receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Tanner Hudson who had the ball stripped near the goal line. Chase was flagged for illegal substitution when he failed to leave the field in time before a punt.
“There was execution in a lot of areas that certainly was good enough to win,” Taylor said. “It’s not because we don’t have the talent, or anything else like that. We lost the turnover battle and we didn’t tackle.”
It’s rare for a team to start 0-2 and reach the playoffs. The Bengals started the 2022 season with two straight losses, then won the AFC North title before losing to the Chiefs in the AFC championship game. Cincinnati hopes to avoid digging another hole.
“The good thing is we have 16 games left to play,” Taylor said. “Starting 0-1 certainly is not a hole we want to be in, but I feel good about how this team will improve.”

WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — As the U.S., China and other powers vie for strategic influence in Pacific Island militaries, the army chief of New Zealand told The Associated Press that not all of the larger nations bidding to offer support are supplying what tiny island nations find most helpful.
New Zealand, which has trained Pacific soldiers for decades, has little military might and has instead long cultivated its reputation through a type of humble soft power when its armed forces are stationed abroad. It has drawn trust by encouraging frank relationships and “diversity of thought” among its training partners in the South Pacific Ocean, Maj. Gen. Rose King told the AP in an interview at defense headquarters in Wellington on Friday. The army’s highest ranking official, who was appointed in June, is the first woman to lead a branch of the New Zealand military.
“One of the things we’re hearing from some of the Pacific nations is lots of people offering help, but it’s not necessarily the help they want or need,” she said. King’s remarks come during an explosion of what she termed the “great power competition” for Pacific influence, with the vast oceanic region of tiny island and atoll nations becoming one of the world’s most fraught sites of geopolitical contest.
King did not single out countries by name. Military chiefs in New Zealand are in non-political roles and are not permitted to comment publicly on government policy. That includes decisions about foreign affairs or military deployments. But New Zealand’s 2023 defense policy statement cites China’s assertive push through the Pacific over the past decade shoring up security deals and agreements to train or equip military or police in a growing list of friendly nations. That has alarmed Western powers so much that it has provoked the U.S. and Australia to pitch their own training measures. 


New Zealand’s army totals a few thousand members for a remote island nation of 5 million people, with little military might or front-line combat involvement in modern times. Military spending is tiny, even for a small nation. But defense analysts say larger powers could learn from New Zealand how to forge better relationships in the Pacific.
“The U.S. and Australia don’t always get those personal relationships quite right, they don’t know how to sit and listen properly,” said Blake Johnson, from the think tank Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The U.S. at times struggled to scale down its proposals to fit Pacific needs, he said.
“And the way that China polices is different to the way that Australia and New Zealand polices,” Johnson said. “They’re typically a bit heavier-handed in their response.”
New Zealand, however, had strong Indigenous cultural links with the Pacific, understood small-scale operations and had the flexibility to adapt. “If anything it’d be great if New Zealand could shout a bit louder to the other partners,” he said.
But New Zealand’s small military footprint presents challenges too. King inherited an army described within the defense force as fragile and hollow. Attrition rates for the service have fallen since a 2022 peak of just over 17% but remain at more than 9% — high among comparable countries.
Vehicles and buildings have grown run down and some barracks where soldiers live with their families are out of use due to black mold. New Zealand does not have a strong military service culture among the public and as a result, politicians need not impress voters with big defense budgets.
Military spending fell to 0.9% of gross domestic product this year from 1% last year and as austerity sweeps across New Zealand’s public sector, the army, too is faced with cuts to make up the shortfall.
“Part of me is really proud that most New Zealanders don’t necessarily see the same threats that I see face our country,” King said. “But yes, there are challenges with that as well.”
When she and her husband, who is also in the army, spent time in America, they were surprised to be thanked for their service by strangers. “That generally doesn’t happen in New Zealand,” King said. “I do think there’s an opportunity for us to share our story more.”
King downplays her status as the first woman to lead a military service in New Zealand. Joining the army in 1991, she arrived at a time when she could not serve in all parts of the army because she was a woman.
Now, 15% of serving army personnel are women. “I would hope to see that figure increase, definitely,” King said, although she was reluctant to cite her planned measures to lift it. 
Military forces globally face other cultural challenges to which New Zealand is not immune. The difficulty of detecting those with extremist views who enter the service, for example, particularly white supremacists, has vexed countries including the U.S.
“I’m confident that we’re doing our best in regard to, how do we ensure we’re getting the right people to join us?” King said.
Despite the country’s remote location and small military footprint, New Zealand’s army faces more pressure on its resources and staff than before and uncertainty about how to prepare for the future. State-on-state conflict — once almost eliminated — is surging in the Russia-Ukraine war and in the Middle East, while climate change pummels New Zealand and the Pacific, with the army facing growing demand for humanitarian aid.
“You’re going to have an increase not only in the frequency of climate change, but also the scale of what’s occurring is at bigger levels, and anything that happens in the Pacific impacts us,” said King.
Matters such as transnational crime showed the current threat environment was not simply “war or not war,” she said.
“I think it comes down to what New Zealand is,” said King, noting that her country is a small, trade-based nation at the bottom of the world.
“If we don’t have the international rules-based order that we currently have, if that is challenged, then we are challenged as a nation,” she said.",False

PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona Supreme Court Justice Robert Brutinel announced Tuesday he will retire this fall, giving Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs a rare opportunity to fill his seat on the Republican-dominated court. 
Brutinel’s retirement is effective Oct. 31, capping off more than four decades as a lawyer and judge in Arizona. He was appointed to the court by former Republican Gov. Jan Brewer in 2009. He served as chief justice from 2019 to 2024. 
“I leave this position with pride in my service on the courts and great confidence in the future of our judicial system, knowing that the courts are in very good hands,” Brutinel wrote in his retirement letter released Tuesday. “The future of our courts is bright.”
The high court was expanded from five to seven members in 2016. All were appointed by Republican governors, though one is a registered independent.
Recently, the court decided a high-profile abortion case by reinstating an 1864 near-total abortion ban. Brutinel was one of two justices who dissented. 
State lawmakers quickly repealed the ban, and Hobbs signed off on the bill. The ban was officially taken off the books this month.
Hobbs spokesperson Christian Slater said the Commission on Appellate Court Appointments must provide Hobbs with a list of candidates to replace Brutinel by the end of the year. The governor would then have 60 days to make a selection, Slater said.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Sometimes the issues brought forward at the United Nations signature annual meeting may feel a bit familiar. Climate change is always in focus, especially in the past few years. There are regular disputes about who is on the security council. Pleas to stop wars and address hunger. 
But this year, it’s what’s not getting as much attention that has Ukraine concerned.
The war in Ukraine was center stage the last two times that world leaders convened for the high-level meeting of the General Assembly. But this year, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the escalating developments along the Israeli-Lebanese border have gotten much of the spotlight.
Ukraine president VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, at the podium, implored world leaders not to give in to calls for a ceasefire that doesn’t guarantee Ukraine’s sovereignty. “When some propose alternatives, half-hearted settlement plans, so-called sets of principles, it not only ignores the interests and suffering of Ukrainians who are affected by the war the most, it not only ignores reality, but also gives Putin the political space to continue the war,” Zelenskyy said.

Here’s your daily guide to what’s going on at the United Nations this week, day by day:
French President EMMANUEL MACRON told the U.N. General Assembly that “Israel cannot, without consequence, just expand its operations to Lebanon.” He urged Israel to cease the escalation, and Hezbollah to cease missile launches to Israel. 


Panama President JOSE RAUL MULINO drew attention to the humanitarian crisis playing out in his country. More than half a million migrants crossed the Darien jungle last year that joins Colombia and Panama. “Panama today is the new border of the United States,” Mulino said, noting that the migrants crossing his country are seeking a better life in the U.S. “I ask you to see the magnitude of what is happening because we feel like we don’t have the international support we are due.”
The chance of a ceasefire proposal to try to stop fighting between Israel and Lebanon took up a lot of oxygen behind the scenes on Wednesday. Rumors floated through the halls, and France called a last-minute session to discuss the conflict. At the session, French Foreign Minister JEAN-NOEL BARROT said later in a meeting of the Security Council that France was working with the U.S. on a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire. 
In a special high-level summit to address the impacts of rising seas, small island nations pleaded for the survival and insisted on their sovereignty despite overflowing oceans. Sea level rise “threatens the well-being of our peoples’ cultures, food security and livelihoods,” said Samoan Prime Minister FIAME NAOMI MATA’AFA, speaking for 39 small island nations. Marshall Islands President HILDA HEINE and others said even if their lands are submerged, their nations should still be recognized, asking the world not to “rig the map and try to erase us with a pencil… sovereignty ultimately rests with our people, not in distant diplomatic centers.” U.S. Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN said the United States is committed to counter — or at least adapt to — rising sea levels that pose an existential threat to many coastal communities around the world. Blinken also said that the Biden administration would oppose any effort to limit or curtail the rights of any countries affected by it.

“Globalization has failed in its mission to bring prosperity to people.”
—XIOMARA CASTRO, president of Honduras
“In this emerging global order, we must ensure the United Nations remains at the forefront of global governance. If multilateralism is to trump unilateralism, the UN’s role, as the world’s foremost multilateral organization, is pivotal. With the necessary resources and resolve, the UN can ensure a future of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity.”
—MOHAMED IRFAAN ALI, president of Guyana
Island nation leaders warned about sea level rise in the most dire and personal terms. “Our future is uncertain,” Fiji President WILIAME KATONVIERE said. “Will our children and their children have a place to call home?” And Maldives President MOHAMED MUIZZU said: “An emergency is upon us, threatening our way of life. Our fight to live on will survive.”
Leaders’ speeches take a variety of forms and are delivered in a variety of languages -- some rendered on plain paper, others on elaborate letterhead. Taken collectively, they represent the words and ideas of an entire governed world — and the politics and maneuverings that come with leading, or helping to lead, one of the nations of Earth.

“Annihilation may bring military success but not political or moral victory. If security systems take over every political decision you forfeit your option to negotiate.”

“Rising seas mean a rising tide of misery. Communities swamped, fresh water contaminated, crops ruined, infrastructure damaged, biodiversity destroyed, and economies decimated – with sectors such as fisheries, agriculture, and tourism pummeled. The poorest and most vulnerable are hardest hit.”

TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Marvin Harrison Jr. had grandiose plans for his first professional football game, one he hoped would be filled with amazing catches, touchdowns and a victory for the Arizona Cardinals.
But as many players have found out over the decades, the NFL is rarely a fairy tale.
Harrison’s pro debut turned out to be a snoozer. The No. 4 overall pick out of Ohio State had just one catch for 4 yards and was targeted only three times. To make it worse, the Buffalo Bills rallied for a 34-28 win over the Cardinals.
“Obviously, it wasn’t great,” Harrison said. “It definitely wasn’t what I expected or what I wanted to happen, what the team wanted to happen.”
The Bills had a lot to do with Harrison’s quiet debut, paying much more attention to him on defense than a normal rookie receiver. He was double-teamed for a majority of the game, giving quarterback Kyler Murray little choice but to look for other options.
Murray said he wasn’t worried about Harrison’s lack of catches.
“Nothing changes,” Murray said. “We’ve got the utmost confidence in what we’re capable of doing. If you went back and watched the game, I think they did a good job of making sure he wasn’t going to be single covered for the majority of the game.
“But I’ll never lose confidence in Marv.”
Second-year coach Jonathan Gannon had a similar response: “Yeah, he’ll be fine. Marvin will be fine. He’ll get back at it and go to work, but no one’s going to put more expectation and pressure and or him wanting to do well than himself. He’ll be perfectly fine.”


Harrison’s lack of production last Sunday called into question Gannon’s decision to sit the rookie for the majority of the preseason. The receiver played one series in the first exhibition game against the Saints, but otherwise had a seat on the bench next to Murray, who didn’t play at all in the three preseason contests.

Harrison said NFL game action was much more intense than anything he experienced during camp.
“It’s totally different,” Harrison said. “You do a lot of things in shirts and shorts, then you go to practice and you’ve got pads on, you’ve got joint practices with the Colts, but there’s nothing like live action.”
Still, he understood Gannon’s decision to keep several starters out of the preseason games.
“We all feel really healthy, and that’s the most important thing,” Harrison said.
Now the Cardinals are preparing for the Los Angeles Rams, who have given the franchise plenty of trouble over the past seven years. Arizona has lost 13 of 15 against the division rival going back to 2017, including a playoff game.
Harrison hopes his presence will help begin to reverse that trend. The rookie didn’t blame anyone for his rough first game and said he knows from his experience at Ohio State that catches can be made when the opposing defense is trying to take him away.
“I’ve got to get open and catch the ball,” Harrison said. “That’s my job as a receiver. That’s my job description.”

METAIRIE, La. (AP) — New Orleans Saints coaches decided to spend Wednesday night at team headquarters as Hurricane Francine struck southeast Louisiana, figuring it would be safer and more productive than trying to commute home right when the worst weather was arriving.
“We’ll probably find a corner of the room to lay down in at some point in time and get a little sleep,” Allen said. “The most significant weather is going to be this evening into the early morning hours, and so that’s kind of when we’d be trying to wrap up. I don’t see anybody trying to get out of here in that type of weather.”
The Saints practiced an hour earlier than usual on their indoor field at team headquarters, after which players were dismissed to ride out the storm at home while coaches remained behind to work on the plan for Sunday’s game against the Cowboys in Dallas.
“We do have a job to do, even when circumstances aren’t perfect, we still have to focus,” Saints quarterback Derek Carr said. “I’ll be home studying tonight, you know, but I’ll be doing it with all my kids sitting right next to me.
“I owe it to my teammates to be locked in and be ready to go for tomorrow,” Carr continued. “We’re human, but we also recognize we have a job to do. And we also recognize that, you know, our city has been through a lot. And so our prayers are with our whole state of Louisiana, you know, wherever this is passing through.”
Francine struck Louisiana on Wednesday evening as a Category 2 storm that forecasters warned could bring deadly storm surge, widespread flooding and destructive winds on parts of the Gulf Coast.


It made landfall about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Morgan City, the National Hurricane Center announced at 4 p.m. CDT, packing maximum sustained winds near 100 mph (155 kph).

Allen said the club was hoping to be able to return to its normal schedule on Thursday if greater New Orleans averted significant damage.
Saints headquarters is equipped with generator power and the facility has endured far stronger storms than Francine, including Katrina in 2005 and Ida in 2021 — although the team evacuated for those storms, and some others over the years, because of the level of danger they posed and the severe disruptions they caused to life in and around the city.
In New Orleans, it is common for private homes to have backup generators as well. Many players have them, including Carr.
The last time the Saints evacuated for a major storm was for Ida, a Category 4 storm, in 2021. The team set up temporary operations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, practiced at TCU and had its first home game moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where New Orleans memorably routed Green Bay, 38-3.
In 2005, the Saints spent nearly the entire season in San Antonio, playing three home games there and four at LSU’s Tiger Stadium before triumphantly returning to the Superdome in downtown New Orleans in September of 2006.
Given that Francine was not expected to be nearly as strong as a storm like Ida, the Saints decided this time that it made more sense to remain in New Orleans — but also to adjust schedules temporarily in a way that helped players and other personnel remain as safe as possible.
“We want everybody to be safe, and yet we still felt we could get our work done and keep everybody safe and not have to try to go through all the logistics to go through an evacuation,” Allen said.
Saints linebacker and defensive captain Demario Davis said players gathered early Wednesday to pray for Louisiana residents who could see the worst of the weather. 
“You can have all the predictions in the world but it’s still unknown as to what’s going to take place,” Davis said. “It’s just one of those things that we’re all just trying to make it through together.”
While players’ afternoon meetings with coaches were called off on Wednesday, Allen said meeting times could be extended on Thursday to make up for that as needed.
Davis stressed that the Saints, coming off a 47-10 victory over Carolina in Week 1, would strive to remain focused on preparations for a Cowboys team that made the playoffs last season and is coming off a convincing 33-17 victory of its own over Cleveland.
“That’s one of the unique things about this game, when you think about the high level that people have to be able to compartmentalize,” Davis said.
The weather, he added, “can’t be an excuse for you not to do your job, but it can be something that can bring you together to build more chemistry, more camaraderie.”

CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago White Sox avoided a record-breaking 121st loss for the second straight game, beating the Los Angeles Angels 4-3 on Wednesday night on Andrew Benintendi’s 10th-inning single.
Chicago is tied with the 1962 New York Mets for the modern major league record for losses in a season. It plays Los Angeles again on Thursday before finishing its schedule with three games at Detroit.
Benintendi delivered the go-ahead hit for the second time in as many games when he lined a one-out single to left-center against José Quijada (2-1), helping the White Sox (38-120) put off infamy for the second night in a row. Designated runner Miguel Vargas scored from second.
The White Sox emptied a cooler on Benintendi after he came through with another winning hit. On Tuesday, Benintendi had a tiebreaking single in the eighth inning of Chicago’s 3-2 win. 
“It feels good to get the win, but it sucks to get it poured on you, especially when it’s starting to cool down a little bit,” Benintendi said. “I was trying to run away a little bit. No, it’s exciting. I mean, you want that poured on you even though deep down you’re kinda trying to avoid it. It’s hard to avoid.”
Korey Lee gave the White Sox a 2-0 lead with a two-run homer in the second Wednesday night. Lenyn Sosa put Chicago back on top with a tiebreaking solo drive in the fourth against José Suarez.
The Angels had runners on the corners in the seventh against Enyel De Los Santos. But they came away empty-handed when Kevin Pillar grounded into a double play.


A sparse crowd was largely quiet until the eighth, when fans started to voice their displeasure with chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. They chanted “Sell the team!” and “Jerry sucks!” and the chorus only grew louder as the Angels tied it against Justin Anderson.
Los Angeles loaded the bases with one out before Michael Stefanic laid down a bunt single on a squeeze play, tying it at 3. Taylor Ward then grounded into a double play.
“We know they’re frustrated, but when you’re in that moment you’re just trying to block all that stuff out, all the negative stuff and focus on the game and what you can do to help the team win. We’re professionals,” White Sox interim manager Grady Sizemore said. “We’re not going to let anything rattle us. We’re going out there and trying to compete and do the best we can to get a win.”
The Angels (63-95) matched a franchise record with their 95th loss, a mark shared by the 1968 and 1980 teams. Los Angeles grounded into three double plays in the final four innings, including one with the bases loaded.
“I don’t know if it was us or if it was them making pitches,” manager Ron Washington said. “But you certainly were looking for the ball to get in the air right there or a base hit. We just couldn’t get it done.”
White Sox starter Davis Martin gave up two runs and three hits in 3 2/3 innings. The right-hander walked a career-high five and hit a batter before exiting with the bases loaded in the fourth.
Michael Soroka came in and gave up a two-run single to Ward. That was the only hit he allowed over 2 1/3 innings. Jared Shuster (2-4) worked the 10th.
Suarez went five innings for Los Angeles, allowing three runs and five hits.
Chicago had never lost more than 106 prior to this year. The White Sox passed that mark with plenty of time to spare when the New York Mets beat them on Sept. 1.
Chicago tied the American League record of 119 losses at San Diego on Saturday and matched the ’62 Mets the following day. But with a chance to lose more games than any team since the 1899 Cleveland Spiders went 20-134, the White Sox put history on hold the past two nights.
Angels: 1B Nolan Schanuel (bruised right leg) exited in the first. He fouled a ball off his leg, and Brandon Drury replaced him in the field in the bottom half.
The White Sox opted to push ace Garrett Crochet’s start back a day to Friday. They will go with RHP Chris Flexen (2-15, 5.15 ERA) for the home finale. LHP Tyler Anderson (10-14, 3.70 ERA) gets the ball for Los Angeles. Sizemore said the White Sox chose to have Crochet start against the playoff-contending Tigers because “it’s gonna make for good baseball.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Emmanuel Rivera went 4 for 4 with two homers and four RBIs to lead the Baltimore Orioles to a 9-2 win over the Minnesota Twins on Saturday night.
Ryan O’Hearn also homered and Jackson Holliday added three hits for the Orioles, who have clinched the top wild card in the American League and will face either the Kansas City Royals or Detroit Tigers in the first round of the playoffs.
“A lot of guys have played really well on this road trip, so I’m encouraged how we’re playing going into the postseason,” said Orioles manager Brandon Hyde, whose team has won four of five games this week in series against the Yankees and Twins.
Brooks Lee had two hits for the Twins, who have lost six of their last seven and were eliminated from playoff contention on Friday. Ryan Jeffers helped the Twins avoid the shutout with a two-run homer with two outs in the ninth.
Baltimore used Matt Bowman as its opener and he got the first four outs. Lefty Tucker Davidson (1-0), making his first appearance for the Orioles after spending the season in Triple-A, allowed four hits over 4 2/3 shutout innings to earn the victory.
“He’s pitched in some big games in his career and had a nice year in Triple-A,” Hyde said of Davidson. “It was awesome to see him get an opportunity and take full advantage of it tonight.”
Twins starter Zebby Matthews (1-4) lasted just three innings, allowing six runs on seven hits with three walks and five strikeouts. Matthews began the season at Class-A Cedar Rapids and worked his way through three minor league levels before making his major league debut on August 13, after the Twins lost starters Joe Ryan and Chris Paddack to injury.


Matthews won his debut, but the Twins went 2-6 in his last eight starts. Still, manager Rocco Baldelli said Matthews would be a candidate for the Twins rotation next spring.
“The ascent was really fast. You don’t see guys pitching in A ball and then starting in September for a team in the middle of a run at the end of the year where a team needs to win games,” Baldellis said. “He did himself very well.”
O’Hearn hit his second homer in as many nights in the first inning, a two-run shot just inside the left field foul pole, giving the Orioles the early lead.
Rivera drove a slider from Matthews into the bullpens in left-center to extend the Baltimore lead to 4-0 in the second inning. He added a double in the third, a solo homer in the fifth and a single in the ninth for the first four-hit game of his career.
“It was something really special. I think every baseball player hopes to have a night like tonight and thankfully I was able to have that one tonight,” Rivera said through an interpreter.
The Twins will start RHP Bailey Ober (12-8, 3.94) in Sunday’s season finale. The Orioles will send RHP Albert Suárez (8-7, 3.74) to the mound for his final tune-up before the postseason.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Pittsburgh Pirates released first baseman Rowdy Tellez and outfielder Michael A. Taylor on Tuesday and promoted infielder Liover Peguero and outfielder Josh Palacios from Triple-A Indianapolis.
The moves came with just six games left in the season and Pittsburgh eliminated from playoff contention.
Tellez recovered from a slow start to hit .243 with 13 home runs and 56 RBIs in 131 games. The Pirates had signed Tellez to a one-year deal in the offseason.
Tellez entered Tuesday four plate appearances shy of a $200,000 bonus, though Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said the bonus had “zero factor” in the decision to cut ties with the 29-year-old, who had become a fan favorite in Pittsburgh during a summer surge.
“We feel like we gave Rowdy lots of opportunity here this year,” Cherington told reporters before Pittsburgh hosted Milwaukee on Tuesday night. “To his credit, he fought through some difficult times earlier in the year and fought his way out of it. Had periods of success and periods of frustration. This is just where we got to in the season.”
Taylor, like Tellez signed to a one-year deal, hit just .193 with five home runs, 21 RBIs and 12 stolen bases in 113 games. His playing time diminished in recent weeks after the Pirates moved shortstop Oneil Cruz to center field.
The 23-year-old Peguero led all Pirates minor leaguers in hits (127), RBIs (79) and doubles (29) and tied for second in extra-base hits (46).
Palacios hit .230 with a pair of homers and seven RBIs in 20 games with Pittsburgh earlier this season.

BEIRUT (AP) — Residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs have been scrambling to make contingency plans since an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in a busy neighborhood killed a top Hezbollah commander and touched off fears of a full-scale war.
For most, that means moving in with relatives or renting homes in Christian, Druze or Sunni-majority areas of Lebanon that are generally considered safer than the Shiite-majority areas where the Hezbollah militant group has its main operations and base of support.
But for a small number, plan B is a move to neighboring Syria. 
Although Syria is in its 14th year of civil war, active fighting has long been frozen in much of the country. Lebanese citizens, who can cross the border without a visa, regularly visit Damascus. And renting an apartment is significantly cheaper in Syria than in Lebanon.
Zahra Ghaddar said she and her family were shaken when they saw an apartment building reduced to rubble by the July 30 drone strike in her area, known as Dahiyeh. Along with Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur, two children and three women were killed and dozens more were injured in the targeted Israeli attack.
Previously, the Lebanese capital had been largely untouched by the near-daily cross-border clashes that have displaced around 100,000 people from southern Lebanon and tens of thousands more in Israel since Oct. 8. That’s when Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of its ally Hamas, which a day earlier led a deadly raid in Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel responded with an aerial bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians.


In recent weeks, the conflict in Lebanon appeared on the brink of spiraling out of control.
Ghaddar said her family first considered moving within Lebanon but were discouraged by social media posts blaming displaced civilians, along with Hezbollah, for the threat of all-out war. Also, surging demand prompted steep rent hikes.
“We found the rents started at $700, and that’s for a house we wouldn’t be too comfortable in,” she said. That amount is more than many Lebanese earn in a month.
So they looked across the border.
Ghaddar’s family found a four-bedroom apartment in Aleppo, a city in northwestern Syria, for $150 a month. They paid six months’ rent in advance and returned to Lebanon.
Israel periodically launches airstrikes on Syria, usually targeting Iranian-linked military sites or militants, but Bashar Assad’s government has largely stood on the sidelines of the current regional conflict.
Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006 that demolished much of southern Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs. At the time, some 180,000 Lebanese took refuge in Syria, many taking shelter in schools, mosques and empty factories. Those who could afford it rented houses. Some put down permanent roots.
Rawad Issa, then a teenager, fled to Syria with his parents. They returned to Lebanon when the war ended, but Issa’s father used some of his savings to buy a house in Syria’s Hama province, just in case.
“That way, if another war happened, we would already have a house ready,” Issa said.
The house and surrounding area were untouched by Syria’s civil war, he said. A few weeks ago, his sister and her husband went to get the house ready for the family to return, in case the situation in Lebanon deteriorated.
Issa, who works in video production, said he initially planned to rent an apartment in Lebanon if the conflict expanded, rather than joining his family in Syria.
But in “safe” areas of Beirut, “they are asking for fantastic prices,” he said. One landlord was charging $900 for a room in a shared apartment. “And outside of Beirut, it’s not much better.”
Azzam Ali, a Syrian journalist in Damascus, told The Associated Press that in the first few days after the strike in Dahiyeh, he saw an influx of Lebanese renting hotel rooms and houses in the city. A Lebanese family — friends of a friend — stayed in his house for a few days, he said. 
In a Facebook post, he welcomed the Lebanese, saying they “made the old city of Damascus more beautiful.”
After the situation appeared to calm down, “some went back and some stayed here, but most of them stayed,” he said.
No agency has recorded how many people have moved from Lebanon to Syria in recent months. They are spread across the country and are not registered as refugees, making tracking the migration difficult. Anecdotal evidence suggests the numbers are small.
Of 80 people displaced from southern Lebanon living in greater Beirut — including Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinian refugees — at least 20 said they were considering taking refuge in Syria if the war in Lebanon escalated, according to interviews conducted by researchers overseen by Jasmin Lilian Diab, director of the Institute for Migration Studies at the Lebanese American University.
Diab noted that the Lebanese considering this route were a niche group who had “existing networks in Syria, either business networks, family or friends.”
The threat of war has also not prompted a mass reverse migration of Syrians from Lebanon. Some 775,000 Syrians are registered with the U.N. Refugee Agency in Lebanon, and hundreds of thousands more are believed to be unregistered in the country.
While fighting in Syria has died down, many refugees fear that if they return they could be arrested for real or perceived ties to the opposition to Assad or forcibly conscripted to the army. If they leave Lebanon to escape war they could lose their refugee status, although some cross back and forth via smuggler routes without their movements being recorded.
Many residents of Dahiyeh breathed a sigh of relief when an intense exchange of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah on July 25 turned out to be short-lived. But Ghaddar said she still worries the situation will deteriorate, forcing her family to flee.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Garrett Nussmeier threw for a career-high 409 yards, Caden Durham had 217 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns and No. 14 LSU piled up a season-high 667 yards of offense in a 42-10 win over South Alabama on Saturday night. 
Durham took a swing pass from Nussmeier 71 yards for a touchdown on the game’s first offensive play, broke loose for an 86-yard run to the 1-yard line, and scored on an 8-yard run as LSU (4-1) built a 21-0 lead in the first quarter. 
Nussmeier had a 1-yard rushing touchdown in the first and a 5-yarder in the second before throwing a 23-yard touchdown pass to Aaron Anderson to give LSU a 35-3 lead at the half. 
“(Offensive coordinator) Joe Sloan is always telling us to start fast,” Nussmeier said. “I don’t know if we thought we were going to start that fast, but Caden made a pair of great plays.”
Nussmeier completed 26 of 39 passes while Durham, a freshman, finished with 128 rushing yards and 89 receiving yards on 10 total touches. Kyren Lacy caught five passes for 107 yards as 11 different LSU players logged at least one reception. 
“Clearly we did some great things offensively tonight,” LSU coach Brian Kelly said. “Over 660 yards of total offense. Characterize it any way you want but Nussmeier, the receivers, Durham — all those guys were high performers tonight.”
Playing its first game since losing preseason All-American linebacker Harold Perkins to a knee injury for the season, LSU got big nights from a pair of other linebackers. Greg Penn had 14 tackles and Whit Weeks had nine in the victory for the Tigers.


South Alabama (2-3) got on the scoreboard early in the second quarter on a 49-yard field goal by Laith Marjan, cutting the deficit to 21-3. The lone touchdown of the night for Jaguars came on their first possession of the third quarter when Gio Lopez found Anthony Eager for a 27-yard touchdown.
Lopez finished 16 of 22 for 171 yards with 33 yards on the ground. Eager had four catches for 91 yards. 
“Other than that one drive in the third quarter, I thought we did some good things tonight defensively,” Kelly said. “We have to tighten up some things here and there, but (South Alabama) is a top 15 offense in the country. We have gotten better over the last five weeks.”
Because No. 2 Georgia and No. 6 Ole Miss both lost Saturday, No. 14 LSU may make a small move up in the AP Top 25 next week.
Struggling to get off to impressive starts through the first four games of the season, LSU exploded early and put the game out of reach in the first half. The Tigers outgained South Alabama by over 300 yards and averaged 13 yards a play in the first half.
LSU: After an off week, will host Ole Miss on Oct. 12.

NEW YORK (AP) — First lady Jill Biden on Monday unveiled a new set of actions to address health inequities faced by women in the United States, plans that include spending at least $500 million annually on women’s health research.
Jill Biden made the announcement at this year’s Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York, moments before the organization honored President Joe Biden with the 2024 Clinton Global Citizen Award.
“He’s provided a playbook for getting things done,” former President Bill Clinton, said as he presented the award. “We honor him today, not just for what he’s accomplished, but for the way he has done it.”
President Biden, standing next to his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton, joked, “This is what you call being trapped.”
In his short remarks, he then called Jill Biden’s announcement one of the most substantial of his administration. 
The additional government spending will mainly come from the Department of Defense, which provides medical care to more than 230,000 active duty military women and nearly 2 million military retirees, as well as their family members. The research will focus on why these women experience endocrine, hematological and other immunity-related disorders twice as often as men. 
“Women are really hungry for this kind of information,” Jill Biden said. “We don’t have the answers.”


Another change will take effect next week, with a new policy that includes women’s health at every step of the research funded by Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, which funded 751 grants last year to study Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus, orthopedic and musculoskeletal injuries, and various cancers.
The commitment was among the largest of the more than 100 expected at the two-day meeting of political, business and philanthropic leaders gathering to address some of the world’s most pressing issues. The Clintons have set this year’s theme as “What’s Working,” a way to look for potential solutions and effective programs in tumultuous times.
“You don’t look at a problem and say, ‘That’s impossible,” Bill Clinton said in his opening remarks. “You don’t just throw up your hands. You roll up your sleeves.”
An example of that strategy came from the announcement that a wide-ranging group of 15 nonprofits, humanitarian aid organizations and other funders will join forces to address the humanitarian crisis in Sudan following more than a year of conflict.
The Coalition for Mutual Aid in Sudan – which includes The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Giving, Global Fund for Women, and The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee — will donate at least $2 million to mutual aid groups in the country by the end of the year. It also pledged to raise another $4.5 million for those groups within the next two years.
Patricia McIlreavy, president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which has been representing the coalition, said that, while much more aid is needed, the collaboration and problem-solving of the group is an important step forward.
“It gets us started,” McIlreavy told The Associated Press. “And it models the behavior you want to see from others. If you wait until it’s the perfect opportunity, you’ve missed many of the opportunities that were good enough.”
World Food Program director Cindy McCain said earlier this month that “ Sudan’s nearly a forgotten crisis ” and that 25 million people there already face acute hunger. Last week, the top United Nations humanitarian official said fighting is escalating in the conflict that began in April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between Sudan’s military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions. The U.N. says more than 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured.
“With ongoing impediments to a large-scale international aid response, Sudanese community groups have become the primary frontline responders and are currently the most effective means of reaching millions on the brink of starvation,” Patricia McIlreavy, president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, said in a prepared statement on behalf of the coalition. “With so many lives on the line, the imperative to support local aid efforts in Sudan has never been more urgent.”
The Center for Disaster Philanthropy says more than 12 million people have been forced from their homes in Sudan, creating what is now the world’s largest displacement and hunger crisis. The danger from the conflict has prevented most international aid agencies from delivering supplies to those in need.
Greg Milne, the Clinton Global Initiative CEO who convened a panel in April to raise awareness and support for the Sudanese people, said the new coalition is an example of what bringing organizations from varied sectors can do.
“We know strong, diverse partnerships can help address often overlooked and even dire challenges, and develop unexpected and innovative solutions,” he said.
Philanthropic leaders, including Bill Gates, World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres, Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee, and Rockefeller Foundation President Raj Shah will share information about their work during CGI, as will Prince Harry, who will discuss the launch of The Archewell Foundation Parents’ Network, which supports parents of children harmed online. In his Tuesday appearance, the Duke of Sussex will also address his work with the World Health Organization and others to reduce violence against children, an issue he and his wife Meghan outlined on a recent trip to Colombia.
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani Sadriu, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics are set to address the conference, as are CEOs from Pfizer, Mastercard, IKEA, Pinterest, Sanofi and Chobani.

Neuroscientist Liz Chrastil got the unique chance to see how her brain changed while she was pregnant and share what she learned in a new study that offers the first detailed map of a woman’s brain throughout gestation.
The transition to motherhood, researchers discovered, affects nearly every part of the brain.
Although the study looks at only one person, it kicks off a large, international research project that aims to scan the brains of hundreds of women and could one day provide clues about disorders like postpartum depression.
“It’s been a very long journey,” said Chrastil, co-author of the paper published Monday in Nature Neuroscience. “We did 26 scans before, during and after pregnancy” and found “some really remarkable things.”
More than 80% of the regions studied had reductions in the volume of gray matter, where thinking takes place. This is an average of about 4% of the brain — nearly identical to a reduction that happens during puberty. While less gray matter may sound bad, researchers said it probably isn’t; it likely reflects the fine-tuning of networks of interconnected nerve cells called “neural circuits” to prepare for a new phase of life.
The team began following Chrastil — who works at the University of California, Irvine, and was 38 years old at the time — shortly before she became pregnant through in vitro fertilization. 
During the pregnancy and for two years after she gave birth, they continued doing MRI brain scans and drawing blood to observe how her brain changed as sex hormones like estrogen ebbed and flowed. Some of the changes continued past pregnancy.


“Previous studies had taken snapshots of the brain before and after pregnancy, but we’ve never witnessed the brain in the midst of this metamorphosis,” said co-author Emily Jacobs of the University of California, Santa Barbara. 
Unlike past studies, this one focused on many inner regions of the brain as well as the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer, said Joseph Lonstein, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at Michigan State University who was not involved in the research. It’s “a good first step to understanding much more about whole-brain changes that could be possible in a woman across pregnancy and postpartum,” he said.
Research in animals has linked some brain changes with qualities that could be helpful when caring for an infant. While the new study doesn’t address what the changes mean in terms of human behavior, Lonstein pointed out that it describes changes in brain areas involved in social cognition, or how people interact with others and understand their thoughts and feelings, for example.
The researchers have partners in Spain and are moving forward with the larger Maternal Brain Project, which is supported by the Ann S. Bowers Women’s Brain Health Initiative and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. 
Eventually, they hope scientists can use data from a large number of women for things like predicting postpartum depression before it happens.
“There is so much about the neurobiology of pregnancy that we don’t understand yet, and it’s not because women are too complicated. It’s not because pregnancy is some Gordian knot,” Jacobs said. “It’s a byproduct of the fact that biomedical sciences have historically ignored women’s health.”

LONDON (AP) — Meta said it’s banning Russia state media organization from its social media platforms, alleging that the outlets used deceptive tactics to amplify Moscow’s propaganda. The announcement drew a rebuke from the Kremlin on Tuesday. 
The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said late Monday that it will roll out the ban over the next few days in an escalation of its efforts to counter Russia’s covert influence operations. 
“After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,” Meta said in a prepared statement. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lashed out, saying that “such selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable,” and that “Meta with these actions are discrediting themselves.” 
“We have an extremely negative attitude towards this. And this, of course, complicates the prospects for normalizing our relations with Meta,” Peskov told reporters during his daily conference call.
RT, formerly known as Russia Today, and Russia Segodnya, also denounced the move. 
“It’s cute how there’s a competition in the West — who can try to spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better,” RT said in a release. 
Rossiya Segodnya, the parent company behind state news agency RIA Novosti and news brands like Sputnik, said Meta’s decision “was not unexpected for us.” 


“Meta is a deeply politicized organization. We will continue our work in the countries where we are present and this decision will not affect our work,” Rossiya Segodnya said in a statement. 
Meta’s actions comes days after the United States announced new sanctions on RT, accusing the Kremlin news outlet of being a key part of Russia’s war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries. 
U.S. officials alleged last week that RT was working hand-in-hand with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine. They also said RT websites masqueraded as legitimate news sites but were used to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere.
Earlier this month, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees of covertly providing millions of dollars in funding to a Tennessee-based content creation company to publish English-language social media videos pushing pro-Kremlin messages.
Moscow has rejected the allegations.
Meta had already taken steps to limit Moscow’s online reach. Since 2020 it has been labeling posts and content from state media. Two years later, it stopped Russian state media from running ads and putting their content lower in people’s feeds, and the company, along with other other social media sites like YouTube and TikTok, stopped European Union users from accessing RT and Sputnik channels after the outlets were sanctioned by Brussels. Also in 2022 Meta took down a sprawling Russia-based disinformation network spreading Kremlin talking points about the invasion of Ukraine. 
Meta and Facebook “already blocked RT in Europe two years ago, now they’re censoring information flow to the rest of the world,” RT said in its statement. 
Moscow has fought back, designating Meta as an extremist group in March 2022, shortly after sending troops into Ukraine, and blocking Facebook and Instagram. Both platforms — as well as Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter, which is also blocked — were popular with Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent media and other forms of critical speech. The social media platforms are now only accessible through virtual private networks.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Hajj-Malik Williams threw three touchdown passes and ran for a score, Ricky White III returned a blocked punt for a score and caught two touchdown passes, and Jai’Den Thomas returned a kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown as unbeaten UNLV breezed to a 59-14 victory over Fresno State in the Rebels’ conference opener on Saturday.
UNLV (4-0, 1-0 Mountain West) opened conference play without starting quarterback Matthew Sluka but didn’t miss a beat with Williams directing the offense. Sluka, who transferred to the Rebels from Holy Cross, announced through his agent on Wednesday that he would sit out the rest of the season over a $100,000 NIL payment he alleges was promised prior to the transfer but never paid.
Williams scored on a 6-yard run to give UNLV a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter. Rashod Tanner blocked a Clay Lawrence punt with 27 seconds left and White picked it up and ran the final 13 yards for a 14-0 lead.
Williams connected with White for a 12-yard touchdown with 1:57 left before halftime and the Rebels led 21-0 at intermission.
Williams pushed UNLV’s lead to four touchdowns with a 17-yard scoring toss Kaleo Ballungay just 2:12 into the third quarter and Caden Chittenden’s 45-yard field goal made it 31-0 heading to the fourth. 
Williams hit White for a 15-yard touchdown eight seconds into the final quarter. Thomas had a 7-yard touchdown run prior to his kickoff-return score. Cameron Friel capped the scoring with 3:10 remaining on a 1-yard run.


Williams completed 13 of 16 passes for 182 yards. He also carried 12 times for 119 yards. White finished with 10 receptions for 127 yards.
Mikey Keene totaled 316 yards on 27-for-41 passing with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Mac Dalena in the fourth quarter and two interceptions for Fresno State (3-2 1-1). Raylen Sharpe hauled in 10 passes for 116 yards. The Bulldogs rushed for just 30 yards on 31 carries.

SEATTLE (AP) — Seattle Mariners right-hander Bryan Woo lost his bid for a perfect game and no-hitter with one out in the seventh inning Wednesday night when San Diego’s Fernando Tatis Jr. hit a solo home run. 
Woo retired the first 19 batters, but left an elevated fastball on the inner half of the plate and Tatis was able to keep the line shot fair down the left field line to end Woo’s bid for perfection. 
Woo relied mostly on his fastball at the top of the strike zone to shut down the Padres prior to the seventh. The closest San Diego came to a hit prior to Tatis’ homer was Manny Machado’s 113 mph line drive leading off the fifth inning that was grabbed by Randy Arozarena in left field with a diving catch.
Third baseman Josh Rojas also made an excellent defensive play charging a slow grounder from Xander Bogaerts and throwing him out to end the second inning. 
Jurickson Profar followed the Tatis homer with a double and Jake Cronenworth walked on a 3-2 pitch with two outs in the inning that ended Woo’s night. 
Woo, in his second season in the majors, was trying to become the first pitcher to throw a perfect game since Domingo Germán of the New York Yankees shut down the Oakland Athletics in an 11–0 win on June 28, 2023. 
Before that, the last perfect game belonged to Mariners ace Felix Hernandez back in 2012 against Tampa Bay.

CLEVELAND (AP) — Lane Thomas hit a two-run homer and drove in three, Josh Naylor had a pair of RBIs, and the AL Central champion Cleveland Guardians clinched a first-round bye in the postseason with a 6-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night.
Tanner Bibee (12-8) allowed one run on four hits over seven innings to win for the first time at home since July 19. The right-hander struck out seven in what could be his final outing until Game 1 of the ALDS.
Cleveland earned a five-day break between the end of the regular season and the start of the division series on Oct. 5 at Progressive Field.
“Getting these days off is going to give us a lot of rejuvenation, especially for a young team,” Bibee said. “Now, we’re going to be here at home for like two weeks in a row. It’s going to be nice.”
Thomas and Kyle Manzardo both went deep against Carson Spiers (5-7) in a three-run first as the Guardians improved their AL-best home record to 49-28. They have the second-best overall mark in the AL, 1 1/2 games behind the New York Yankees.
Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said he will treat the next four games the same way as the first 158, but admitted, “We might give guys a day off.”
“We’ve said from the beginning that we think we can play with anybody –- and these guys have proved it,” the first-year skipper said. “It’s incredible, so great for them. We couldn’t be happier about this opportunity.”


The Reds made their debut under interim manager Freddie Benavides, who was promoted Sunday after David Bell was fired. Benavides’ only managerial experience was four years in the minors for Cincinnati, most recently in 2007 at Single-A Billings.
With the loss, Cincinnati was assured of finishing with a losing record for the eighth time in 10 seasons.
Spencer Steer had an RBI single in the fourth, plating Tyler Stephenson, for the Reds’ final hit. Leadoff hitter Jonathan India was struck on the helmet by a pitch in the fifth, but remained in the game for two more innings.
Hunter Gaddis and AL saves leader Emmanuel Clase retired all six batters they faced to complete the four-hitter for the Guardians.
“Bibee kept us off-balance and he kept balls off the barrel, basically,” Benavides said. “Those two guys at the end are pretty good, too. It’s a solid, solid staff they have on that side.”
Spiers gave up three runs in four innings. Ian Gibaut followed in his first major league appearance since Sept. 30, 2023, working one inning and allowing one run.
Reds: RHP Julian Aguiar (right elbow sprain), who was scheduled to start Wednesday, was placed on the injured list after being hurt during a throwing session. Aguiar did not travel to Cleveland in order to undergo an MRI.
Guardians: OF Steven Kwan (mid-back inflammation) took swings in the batting cage and Vogt said he will be activated during the homestand. The All-Star left fielder was eligible to come off the IL on Tuesday.
Reds RHP Jakob Junis (4-0, 2.61 ERA) takes on Guardians LHP Joey Cantillo (2-3, 4.63 ERA) in the two-game series finale. Trade deadline acquisition Junis was scratched from starting the opener for personal reasons.

Publication date:2024-09-17 07:00:00

A key employee who labeled a doomed experimental submersible unsafe prior to its last, fatal voyage testified Tuesday that the tragedy could have been prevented if a federal safety agency had investigated his complaint.
David Lochridge, OceanGate’s former operations director, said he felt let down by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s decision not to follow through on the complaint.
“I believe that if OSHA had attempted to investigate the seriousness of the concerns I raised on multiple occasions, this tragedy may have been prevented,” he said while speaking before a commission trying to determine what caused the Titan to implode en route to the wreckage of the Titanic last year, killing all five on board. “As a seafarer, I feel deeply disappointed by the system that is meant to protect not only seafarers but the general public as well.”
Lochridge said during testimony that eight months after he filed an OSHA complaint, a caseworker told him the agency had not begun investigating it yet and there were 11 cases ahead of his. By then, OceanGate was suing Lochridge and he had filed a countersuit.
About 10 months after he filed the complaint, he decided to walk away. The case was closed and both lawsuits were dropped.
“I gave them nothing, they gave me nothing,” he said of OceanGate.
OSHA officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.


Earlier in the day, Lochridge said he frequently clashed with the company’s co-founder and felt the company was committed only to making money.
Lochridge was one of the most anticipated witnesses to appear before a commission. His testimony echoed that of other former employees Monday, one of whom described OceanGate head Stockton Rush as volatile and difficult to work with.
“The whole idea behind the company was to make money,” Lochridge said. “There was very little in the way of science.”
Rush was among the five people who died in the implosion. OceanGate owned the Titan and brought it on several dives to the Titanic going back to 2021.
Lochridge’s testimony began a day after other witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration.
Lochridge joined the company in the mid-2010s as a veteran engineer and submersible pilot and said he quickly came to feel he was being used to lend the company scientific credibility. He said he felt the company was selling him as part of the project “for people to come up and pay money,” and that did not sit well with him.
“I was, I felt, a show pony,” he said. “I was made by the company to stand up there and do talks. It was difficult. I had to go up and do presentations. All of it.”
Lochridge referenced a 2018 report in which he raised safety issues about OceanGate operations. He said with all of the safety issues he saw “there was no way I was signing off on this.”
Asked whether he had confidence in the way the Titan was being built, he said: “No confidence whatsoever.”
Employee turnover was very high at the time, said Lochridge, and leadership dismissed his concerns because they were more focused on “bad engineering decisions” and a desire to get to the Titanic as quickly as possible and start making money. He eventually was fired after raising the safety concerns, he said.
“I didn’t want to lose my job. I wanted to do the Titanic. But to dive it safely. It was on my bucket list, too,” he said.
OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion.
OceanGate’s former engineering director, Tony Nissen, kicked off Monday’s testimony, telling investigators he felt pressured to get the vessel ready to dive and refused to pilot it for a journey several years before Titan’s last trip. Nissen worked on a prototype hull that predated the Titanic expeditions.
“‘I’m not getting in it,’” Nissen said he told Rush.
OceanGate’s former finance and human resources director, Bonnie Carl, testified Monday that Lochridge had characterized the Titan as “unsafe.”
Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community.
During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about the Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if the Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display.
One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, “all good here,” according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing.
When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said.
Scheduled to appear later in the hearing are OceanGate co-founder Guillermo Sohnlein and former scientific director, Steven Ross, according to a list compiled by the Coast Guard. Numerous guard officials, scientists, and government and industry officials are also expected to testify. The U.S. Coast Guard subpoenaed witnesses who were not government employees, said Coast Guard spokesperson Melissa Leake.
Among those not on the hearing witness list is Rush’s widow, Wendy Rush, the company’s communications director. Lochridge said Wendy Rush had an active role in the company when he was there.
Asked about Wendy Rush’s absence, Leake said the Coast Guard does not comment on the reasons for not calling specific individuals to a particular hearing during ongoing investigations. She said it’s common for a Marine Board of Investigation to “hold multiple hearing sessions or conduct additional witness depositions for complex cases.”
OceanGate has no full-time employees at this time but will be represented by an attorney during the hearing, the company said in a statement. The company said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began.
The ongoing Marine Board of Investigation is the highest level of marine casualty investigation conducted by the Coast Guard. When the hearing concludes, recommendations will be submitted to the Coast Guard’s commandant. The National Transportation Safety Board is also conducting an investigation.",False

NEW YORK (AP) — Single mother Rebecca Wood, 45, was already dealing with high medical bills in 2020 when she noticed she was being charged a $2.49 “program fee” each time she loaded money onto her daughter’s school lunch account.
As more schools turn to cashless payment systems, more districts have contracted with processing companies that charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The report found that though legally schools must offer a fee-free option to pay by cash or check, there’s rarely transparency around it.
“It wouldn’t have been a big deal if I had hundreds of dollars to dump into her account at the beginning of the year,” Wood said. “I didn’t. I was paying as I went, which meant I was paying a fee every time. The $2.50 transaction fee was the price of a lunch. So I’d pay for six lunches, but only get five.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal policy on fee-free school lunch, has mandated that districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.
“It’s just massively inconvenient,” said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. 
Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.


“A dollar here and there, I expected,” she said. “But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.”
Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day, for two working parents, was an increased burden of time and effort. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free lunches in school, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.
In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. 
Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child’s account. For families with lower incomes who can’t afford to load large sums in one go, those fees can hit weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.
In Wood’s case, she researched the fees and learned about the USDA requirement to offer fee-free payment by cash or by check. When she pointed this out to the superintendent of her daughter’s Massachusetts school district, the administrator said the lack of transparency was an oversight. To protest, Wood had planned to pay for her daughter’s lunches in coins at the school office, together with other parents. But then the pandemic hit, changing, among other things, school lunch policy.
In subsequent years, Wood became part of a campaign that successfully pushed for universal free school lunches in the state, but she continues to protest school processing fees for families.
“Even if lunch itself is free, if you want to buy something a la carte, or an extra lunch, or some other transaction, you still have to pay that fee,” Wood said. “They take money from people who need it the most.”
While payment companies maintain that school districts have the chance to negotiate fees and rates when they form their contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures “may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.” Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report.
Without the ability to choose which company to work with, “families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,” the agency said, “including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.”
The companies named in the report did not respond to requests for comment.
Know that you always have a right to pay by cash or check, under federal policy. You can also request that your school district negotiate down the fees with their payment processing company, or request that the district cover the fees directly, which can give them leverage in negotiating a contract. 
If your school is located in a low-income area, you may also check whether your district qualifies for the Community Eligibility Provision, which would allow the school to provide free breakfast and lunch to all enrolled students. More information on the CEP is available at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website.

                Question: How many hotel workers represented by the UNITE HERE union walked off the job on September 1, 2024?

Publication date:2024-09-01 07:00:00

With up to 17 rooms to clean each shift, Fatima Amahmoud’s job at the Moxy hotel in downtown Boston sometimes feels impossible.
There was the time she found three days worth of blond dog fur clinging to the curtains, the bedspread and the carpet. She knew she wouldn’t finish in the 30 minutes she is supposed to spend on each room. The dog owner had declined daily room cleaning, an option that many hotels have encouraged as environmentally friendly but is a way for them to cut labor costs and cope with worker shortages since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unionized housekeepers, however, have waged a fierce fight to restore automatic daily room cleaning at major hotel chains, saying they have been saddled with unmanageable workloads, or in many cases, fewer hours and a decline in income. 
The dispute has become emblematic of the frustration over working conditions among hotel workers, who were put out of their jobs for months during pandemic shutdowns and returned to an industry grappling with chronic staffing shortages and evolving travel trends.
Some 10,000 hotel workers represented by the UNITE HERE union walked off the job Sunday at 24 hotels in eight cities, including Honolulu, Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Seattle. Hotel workers in other cities could strike in the coming days, as contract talks stall over demands for higher wages and a reversal of service and staffing cuts. At total of 15,000 workers have voted to authorize strikes. 
“We said many times to the manager that it is too much for us,” said Amahmoud, whose hotel was among those where workers have authorized a strike but have not yet walked out. 


Michael D’Angelo, Hyatt’s head of labor relations for the Americas, said the company’s hotels have contingency plans to minimize the impact of the strikes. “We are disappointed that UNITE HERE has chosen to strike while Hyatt remains willing to negotiate,” he said. 
In a statement before the strikes began, Hilton said it was “committed to negotiating in good faith to reach fair and reasonable agreements.” Marriott and Omni did not return requests for comments. 
The labor unrest serves as a reminder of the pandemic’s lingering toll on low-wage women, especially Black and Hispanic women who are overrepresented in front-facing service jobs. Although women have largely returned to the workforce since bearing the brunt of pandemic-era furloughs — or dropping out to take on caregiving responsibilities — that recovery has masked a gap in employment rates between women with college degrees and those without.
The U.S. hotel industry employs about 1.9 million people, some 196,000 fewer workers than in February 2019, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nearly 90% of building housekeepers are women, according to federal statistics.

It’s a workforce that relies overwhelmingly on women of color, many of them immigrants, and which skews older, according to UNITE HERE. 
Union President Gwen Mills characterizes the contract negotiations as part of long-standing battle to secure family-sustaining compensation for service workers on par with more traditionally male-dominated industries.
“Hospitality work overall is undervalued, and it’s not a coincidence that it’s disproportionately women and people of color doing the work,” Mills said.
The union hopes to build on its recent success in southern California, where after repeated strikes it won significant wage hikes, increased employer contributions to pensions, and fair workload guarantees in a new contract with 34 hotels. Under the contract, housekeepers at most hotels will earn $35 an hour by July 2027.
The American Hotel And Lodging Association says 80% of its member hotels report staffing shortages, and 50% cite housekeeping as their most critical hiring need. 
Kevin Carey, the association’s interim president and CEO, says hotels are doing all they can to attract workers. According to the association’s surveys, 86% of hoteliers have increased wages over the past six months. 
“Now is a fantastic time to be a hotel employee,” Carey said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. 
Hotel workers say the reality on the ground is more complicated. 
Maria Mata, 61, a housekeeper at the W Hotel in San Francisco, said she earns $2,190 every two weeks if she gets to work full time. But some weeks, she only gets called in one or two days, causing her to max out her credit card to pay for household expenses
“It’s hard to look for a new job at my age. I just have to keep the faith that we will work this out,” Mata said.
Guests at the Hilton Hawaiian Village often tell Nely Reinante they don’t need their rooms cleaned because they don’t want her to work too hard. She said she seizes every opportunity to explain that refusing her services creates more work for housekeepers. 
Since the pandemic, UNITE HERE has won back automatic daily room cleans at some hotels in Honolulu and other cities, either through contract negotiations, grievance filings or local government ordinances.
But the issue is back on the table at many hotels where contracts are expiring. Mills said UNITE HERE is striving for language to make it difficult for hotels to quietly encourage guests to opt out of daily housekeeping.
The U.S. hotel industry has rebounded from the pandemic despite average occupancy rates that remain shy of 2019 levels, largely due to higher room rates and record guest spending per room. Average revenue per available room, a key metric, is expected to reach a record high of $101.84 in 2024, according the hotel association. 
David Sherwyn, the director of the Cornell University Center for Innovative Hospitality Labor & Employment Relations, said UNITE HERE is a strong union but faces a tough fight over daily room cleaning because hotels consider reducing services part of a long-term budget and staffing strategy.
“The hotels are saying the guests don’t want it, I can’t find the people and it’s a huge expense,” Sherwyn said. “That’s the battle.” 
Workers bristle at what they see as moves to squeeze more out of them as they cope with erratic schedules and low pay. While unionized housekeepers tend to make higher wages, pay varies widely between cities.

Chandra Anderson, 53, makes $16.20 an hour as a housekeeper at the Hyatt Regency Baltimore Inner Harbor, where workers have not yet voted to strike. She is hoping for a contract that will raise her hourly pay to $20 but says the company came back with a counteroffer that “felt like a slap in the face.” 
Anderson, who has been her household’s sole breadwinner since her husband went on dialysis, said they had to move to a smaller house a year ago in part because she wasn’t able to get enough hours at her job. Things have improved since the hotel reinstated daily room cleaning earlier this year, but she still struggles to afford basics like groceries.
Tracy Lingo, president of UNITE HERE Local 7, said the Baltimore members are seeking pensions for the first time but the biggest priority is bringing hourly wages closer to those in other cities. 
“That’s how far behind we are,” Lingo said.

EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Ohio State looks like it might have its next great receiver.
Jeremiah Smith had a 19-yard touchdown run and made a one-handed, 17-yard catch for a score in the second quarter, helping the 3rd-ranked Buckeyes pull away and rout Michigan State 38-7 on Saturday night.
The Buckeyes (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) were in a closely contested game until their freshman phenom took over.
“It flipped the game,” coach Ryan Day said. “It’s where the game turned.”
The Spartans (3-2, 1-1) lost the football three times in the red zone in the first half to hurt their chances of hanging around.
“If we don’t get those turnovers, it’s a different game,” Day said.
Smith’s speed allowed him to go untouched on an end-around midway through the second quarter. His skill set him up to leap and snag Devin Brown’s pass with his right hand — three plays after needing only one hand to make a twisting, 27-yard catch between two defenders — to put Ohio State ahead 24-7 in the final minute of the first half.
“What an unbelievable catch,” Day said. “I can’t believe he caught it.”
Smith, though, said it wasn’t his favorite catch of the night.
“The one before was my favorite,” he said.
The country’s top-rated recruit, who is from Miami Gardens, Florida, finished with five receptions for 83 yards.
Smith has lived up to the billing.
He became the first freshman to catch two touchdown passes in a season opener with a program that has a rich tradition at receiver and had 14 catches for 281 yards and four touchdowns over the first three games.


Marvin Harrison Jr., drafted No. 4 overall by Arizona, was the last star at the position for the powerhouse program and the 6-foot-3, 215-pound Smith seems to be the latest.
“He has all the intangibles that you want in a prototypical receiver,” Emeka Egbuka said.
Will Howard, who took a hit that knocked him out of the game briefly in the first half, completed 21 of 31 passes for 244 yards. He had a 3-yard touchdown pass to Gee Scott in the first quarter and a 33-yard touchdown pass to Egbuka to convert a fourth-and-5 late in the third quarter.
Howard threw an interception that helped the Spartans pull within three points early in the second quarter.
Aidan Chiles was 13 of 19 for 167 yards with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Jaron Glover with 7:22 left in the first half that made the score 10-7. He threw an interception in the third quarter.
The Spartans made enough plays to get into the red zone on their first two drives, but didn’t score because Chiles was stuffed on a fourth-down sneak at the 20 and Jack Velling lost a fumble at the 11. Chiles coughed up the football at the Ohio State 16 in the second quarter.
“We did not help ourselves,” coach Jonathan Smith said.
Michigan State, he said, is “far away,” from matching up with Ohio State.
“It’s in the details, and it’s in the turnovers,” he said.
Ohio State has one of the best tandem of receivers in college football with Smith and Egbuka, a senior standout, who had seven catches for 96 yards and a touchdown.
Michigan State entered the game with 10 turnovers in four games and added three more against the Buckeyes, continuing a troubling trend for its first-year coach.
The Buckeyes could be No. 3 for the fourth straight week in the AP Top 25.
Ohio State hosts Iowa on Saturday.
Michigan State plays at No. 8 Oregon on Saturday.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed early Sunday they shot down another American-made MQ-9 drone flying over the country, marking potentially the latest downing of the multimillion-dollar surveillance aircraft. The U.S. launched airstrikes over Houthi-controlled territory afterward, the rebels said.
The U.S. military told The Associated Press it was aware of the claim but has “received no reports” of American military drones being downed over Yemen. 
The rebels offered no pictures or video to support the claim as they have in the past, though such material can appear in propaganda footage days later. 
However, the Houthis have repeatedly downed General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper drones in the years since they seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in 2014. Those attacks have exponentially increased since the start of the Israel-Hamas war and the Houthis launched their campaign targeting shipping in the Red Sea corridor. 
Houthi military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree made the claim in a prerecorded video message. He said the Houthis shot down the drone over Yemen’s Marib province, a long-contested area home to key oil and gas fields that’s been held by allies of a Saudi-led coalition battling the rebels since 2015. 
Saree offered no details on how the rebels down the aircraft. However, Iran has armed the rebels with a surface-to-air missile known as the 358 for years. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in seaborne shipments heading to Yemen despite a United Nations arms embargo. 


The Houthis “continue to perform their jihadist duties in victory for the oppressed Palestinian people and in defense of dear Yemen,” Saree said. 
Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years. 
After the claim, the Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel reported multiple U.S.-led airstrikes near the city of Ibb. Late Sunday, the U.S. military’s Central Command said it had “destroyed three Iranian-backed Houthi uncrewed aerial vehicles and two missile systems in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen,” without elaborating. 
The Americans have been striking Houthi targets intensely since January. 
The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.
The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
Those attacks include the barrage that struck the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in the Red Sea. Salvagers last week abandoned an initial effort to tow away the burning oil tanker, leaving the Sounion stranded and its 1 million barrels of oil at risk of spilling.",False

NEW YORK (AP) — Grayson Rodriguez won’t pitch again this year, another setback for the injury-ravaged Baltimore Orioles as they prepare for the playoffs.
Rodriguez, the team’s No. 2 starter, has been on the injured list since early August because of right lat discomfort. Even last week, the Orioles were still hoping to get him back before October. But manager Brandon Hyde said Wednesday the right-hander is being shut down and will miss the postseason.
“He was progressing fine,” Hyde said at Yankee Stadium. “It’s normally an injury which takes some time, and to get him back for the playoffs was going to be a little bit of a rush. And we just felt like for his health, for his future, it was the right thing to do.”
Rodriguez was 13-4 with a 3.86 ERA over 20 starts in his second major league season. He struck out 130 batters and walked 36 in 116 2/3 innings.
“That’s a loss. We’ve missed him,” Hyde said.
A heralded prospect when he arrived in the big leagues last year, Rodriguez is 20-8 with a 4.11 ERA in 43 career starts.
“Going to get him ready for 2025,” Hyde said. “It’s disappointing. It’s tough. But he’s so talented, and a huge part of our rotation this year and going forward. So, just ran out of time.”
Despite a rash of injuries, particularly to their pitching staff, the Orioles clinched their second consecutive playoff appearance Tuesday night. They are guaranteed at least an American League wild card and are in the driver’s seat to host a best-of-three Wild Card Series next week at Camden Yards.


Starting pitchers Kyle Bradish, John Means and Tyler Wells are all sidelined following Tommy John surgery. All-Star closer Félix Bautista also is recovering from Tommy John surgery and will miss the entire season. 
“It’s part of the game, unfortunately. It’s part of the game that stinks. But we’ve been missing guys all year and hung in there,” Hyde said.
Corbin Burnes, Zach Eflin, Dean Kremer and Albert Suárez still give Baltimore several good options for its playoff rotation.
The second-place Orioles are four games behind the AL East-leading New York Yankees with four to play.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) — James Franklin asked Penn State fans to bring White-Out energy into Beaver Stadium on Saturday night.
They didn’t let him down, wearing white, painting their faces and shaking pom poms to help rally the Nittany Lions in their Big Ten opener.
Nick Singleton ran for 102 yards and a touchdown, Kaytron Allen added 94 yards and a score and No. 9 Penn State pulled away in the second half to beat No. 19 Illinois 21-7.
Penn State (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) took a 14-7 lead on Singleton’s 4-yard touchdown run on its opening second-half possession. The Nittany Lions then went into lockdown mode as 109,911 fans all clad in white helped shut down what had been a surging Illinois offense.
“That was a phenomenal environment,” Franklin said. “We thought the fans had seven impacts on the game, whether it was timeouts, false starts, penalties or bad snaps.”
The Nittany Lion defense was there to capitalize. Penn State forced four punts, recovered a fumble and A.J. Harris intercepted Luke Altmyer’s pass late in the fourth quarter.
After scoring easily on their opening drive, the Illini (4-1, 1-1) managed just 25 rushing yards the rest of the way. They were tackled 13 times behind the line of scrimmage and allowed seven sacks.
Both teams scored on their first possessions before sputtering for the rest of the first half.
The Illini calmly marched 75 yards through the lingering smoke of pregame fireworks, converting a pair of third downs and getting help from a late hit to set up a Altmyer’s 4-yard touchdown pass to Carson Goda.


The Nittany Lions needed just eight plays over 4:02 to pull even. After big runs from quarterback Drew Allar and Singleton, tight end Tyler Warren leapt over the line of scrimmage from 3 yards out.
Penn State drove into Illinois’ territory again late in the second quarter, but stalled out at the 23 and Sander Sahaydak missed a 40-yard field goal.
Illinois botched its best shot to retake the lead moments later.
Having directed his offense down to Penn State’s 2, Altmyer had to retreat as the first-down snap sailed over his head. He then lost 3 yards on a keeper before he was sacked and called for intentional grounding on third down.
With the noise swelling, the Illini jumped early on their field goal try and kicker David Olano missed on the retry from 45 yards. It was one of five pre-snap penalties by the Illini on the night.
“Some moments that we could’ve capitalized on just didn’t happen,” Illinois coach Bret Bielema said. “You can’t beat the No. 9 team in the country having a first and goal at the 2 and come away with zero points. It doesn’t add up.”
After his first 40-yard try sailed wide left, Sahaydak missed another kick from the same distance, this time pushing it wide right.
Franklin said he wouldn’t make a decision on changing kickers afterward, however.
Illinois: Illinois started fast but couldn’t make the adjustments necessary to escape Penn State’s speed on defense as the game wore on. Still, Illinois is off to its best start and has plenty to be proud of going into an off week.
Penn State: The Nittany Lions have one of the best rushing games in the country. Singleton and Allen bounced off tacklers and dragged others all night.
“I don’t know if there’s a better combination of running backs in the country,” Franklin said.
Tom Allen’s defense made enough tweaks to snuff out what had been a surging Illini offense.
Illinois: Hosts Purdue on Oct. 12.
Penn State: Hosts UCLA on Saturday.

CINCINNATI (AP) — Michael Harris II and Matt Olson homered for Atlanta, but the Braves blew a four-run lead in a costly 6-5 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night.
Pierce Johnson and Jesse Chavez struggled as Atlanta dropped its third consecutive game. The Braves (81-70) fell two games back of the New York Mets (83-68) for the third NL wild card.
Harris hit a leadoff drive in the first against Brandon Williamson. Marcell Ozuna reached on a one-out single before Olson made it 3-0 with his 26th homer.
Jorge Soler’s 19th homer made it 5-1 in the fourth. But that was it for Atlanta, which went 2 for 9 with runners in scoring position and left 14 runners on base.
“We kind of shot ourselves in the foot a couple times,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “This is one of those places, too. You’re never safe. You have to keep scoring. There were a couple plays that could have been executed better.”
Spencer Steer homered for Cincinnati, and Tyler Stephenson had two hits and drove in a run. The Reds (74-78) improved to 4-0 against the Braves this year.
Jake Fraley started Cincinnati’s rally with a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the fourth. The Reds added two more runs in the sixth against Chavez.
Stephenson hit a leadoff single in the seventh and Steer hit a drive to left-center off Johnson (5-5), giving Cincinnati a 6-5 lead.
Steer has 20 homers and 25 steals. He joined Elly De La Cruz as the first teammates on the Reds with at least 20 homers and 20 steals in the same season since Barry Larkin and Eric Davis accomplished the feat in 1996.


“I try to show up every day and take good at bats to help this team win. That’s why I showed so much emotion. I felt it was a big spot and I feel like I’ve not been the guy I needed to be for this team,” Steer said. “I hold myself to a high standard. This game is all about consistency and I haven’t been as consistent as I’d like.”
Steer is still among the league leaders with 91 RBIs.
Atlanta right-hander Grant Holmes pitched four innings in his first start since Aug. 14. He was charged with two runs and five hits.
“Grant gave us everything we needed and more,” Snitker said. “I thought Jesse threw the ball really well. It was just a couple of misplays.”
Williamson left the game in the second inning with a strained left elbow. He permitted three runs and three hits.
“It was one pitch that did it,” Reds manager David Bell said. “He had an MRI tonight but there is going to be a follow-up tomorrow in the afternoon.”
Brent Suter (1-0) got one out for the win, and Alexis Díaz handled the ninth for his 28th save in 32 tries.
Ozuna had two hits, raising his batting average to .303. But he hasn’t hit a home run in his last 26 games. He hasn’t driven in a run in his last 19.
“We’ve been struggling to score runs lately but I’d hate to see where we’d be without him,” Snitker said.
Braves: INF Ozzie Albies started a rehab assignment in the minors. Snitker hopes to have him back for an upcoming series against Miami.
Spencer Schwellenbach (6-7, 3.73 ERA) starts for Atlanta on Wednesday, and Jakob Junis (4-0, 2.73 ERA) goes for the Reds.

Publication date:2024-09-25 20:22:00

Melania Trump is the first lady who has seldom been there. 
The wife of Republican presidential candidate and former chief executive Donald Trump walked directly into the fire of public scrutiny early, when her debut speech to the 2016 Republican National Convention drew immediate charges of plagiarism. Since then, it has been clear that she rejects the tradition-bound idea that participation is mandatory while married to a president of the United States. On stage during a rare appearance at Trump’s side during the RNC in July, Melania Trump showed affection to her husband and waved to the delegates — but said nothing. 
She’s speaking up now. 
Weeks before the Nov. 5 presidential election, Melania Trump is releasing a series of videos ahead of her self-titled memoir that tick through her choice subjects — her nude photos, motherhood, the media. 
The timing, too, is key. Until at least Election Day, Melania Trump is still a potential first lady. Beyond that, her marketability is in some way up to American voters as they choose between her husband and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
“She is capitalizing on the time she has left before the election Her (market) value is gone if she is no longer a prospective first lady,” said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, Melania Trump’s former friend and adviser, who supports Harris. “If Harris wins, I believe people will want to move on.”
And so Melania Trump’s memoir will come out just weeks after two assassination attempts against her husband, whom she described in a July 14 statement as “the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.”


Like her husband, Melania Trump, 54, has telegraphed from the very beginning of the family’s political saga that she’ll break norms without apology. 
“I have my own mind,” she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2016. “I am my own person, and I think my husband likes that about me.”
Like anyone who releases a memoir, Melania Trump must care very much what people think about her. She begins her story with a grievance.
“As a private person who has often been the subject of public scrutiny and misrepresentation,” she says in the trailer for her memoir on her website. “I feel a responsibility to clarify the facts. I believe it is important to share my perspective,” which she calls “the truth.”
Other grievances follow against dramatic background music. In one, she asks why “the media has chosen to scrutinize my celebration of the human form in a fashion photo shoot,” as classical art such as Michelangelo’s “David” scroll across the screen to dramatic music. That’s a reference to nude photos of her from modeling work in the 1990s (she was known then as Melania Knauss) that were publicly known during the 2016 campaign, partly in the context of the work visa she had. 
In another, she takes aim at the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 in a search for classified documents the government says Trump illegally retained from his presidency and obstructed efforts to get them back. Trump has pleaded not guilty and a judge dismissed the case, a move that prosecutors are appealing. She said the FBI searched through her personal belongings and said the incident should serve as an unspecified “warning” to Americans.
“I never imagined my privacy would be invaded by the government here in America,” she says over sorrowful music.
What to know about the 2024 Election
Another video rebuts criticism from the Rose Garden incident of 2020, when the then-first lady renovated the iconic Kennedy-era gathering place near the Oval Office. Historians still grit their teeth over the redo, which they see as evidence of disrespect for the White House. To the contrary, she says of the Rose Garden in this video: “I felt a deep responsibility to respect tradition and to preserve its grandeur for future generations.”
Motherhood, she says in another video, brings her “immense fulfillment.” 
Melania Trump is tracking her financial future, and Barron’s. 
Trump’s financial report released in August shows that his spouse earned income that includes $330,000 from the sale of NFTs and $237,500 for a speech in April to the Log Cabin Republicans in Palm Beach, Florida.
Also, for months after her husband began his presidency, she stayed in New York. The official reason was to wait for Barron to finish the school year rather than uprooting him midterm. In fact, the delay was her effort to gain leverage to renegotiate the couple’s prenuptial agreement, according to Washington Post journalist Mary Jordan’s 2020 book, which the Trump White House denounced. Melania Trump wanted better terms for herself and for Barron. 
She’s publishing her books through Skyhorse Publishing — not Winning Team, which put out her husband’s three books since he left office.
Before deciding on Skyhorse, her representatives reached out to at least three major New York publishers who were unable to agree to terms on a deal, multiple publishing officials told The Associated Press. The officials were not authorized to discuss their interactions with Trump’s representatives and asked not to be identified. The officials all said that negotiations never advanced beyond general discussions and that Trump herself did not participate.
Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama were among previous first ladies who worked with major New York publishers and received multimillion-dollar advances. Trump’s decision to work with Skyhorse, where fellow authors include such controversial public figures as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Woody Allen, was not necessarily her first choice, publishing sources say.
A Skyhorse spokesperson, citing company policy, declined comment on the publisher’s negotiations with Trump. The Trump campaign did not return requests for comment.
There’s a whole other history, of course, about Trump’s two impeachments, criminal convictions, rape accusations and hush money scheme to prevent Melania Trump from finding out that he’d slept with porn actor Stormy Daniels. There’s no sign that they’ll be referenced even obliquely in his wife’s memoir. The former president denies doing anything wrong.
Early on, Melania Trump was plenty familiar with her husband’s personality, and she showed signs of how she’d handle the times when his bombast and misogyny went public. The release of the Access Hollywood recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women by their genitals is one such example. According to “The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump,” Trump’s campaign insisted that Melania stand by her husband at a press conference. Melania Trump watched the tape, and gave her answer.
“No,” she is quoted as saying, insisting instead on releasing a statement. It said that her husband’s words had been “unacceptable and offensive” and urged voters to accept his apology, as she had.
She clearly sees herself as a participating member of the first ladies club, musing to Harper’s Bazaar in 2016 that she admired Jackie Kennedy’s elegance and appealing manner. She stands out among historians in less-than-flattering terms, and it’s unclear how history will remember her. 
Robert Watson, an expert on first ladies and a history professor at Lynn University in Florida, notes that Melania Trump’s “unforced errors” during her husband’s administration reflected poorly on it, including “wrecking the beloved White House Rose Garden” and wearing a jacket emblazoned on the back with the words, “I really don’t care, do u” after a visit with young children separated from their parents at the U.S border with Mexico. Even her “Be Best” campaign, he said, doesn’t stack up next to Lady Bird Johnson’s conservation program, the Bush family’s efforts to promote reading and Rosalynn Carter’s drive on behalf of mental health. 
“One of the cardinal rules for a first lady is to do no harm ... in this respect, Melania comes up short,” Watson said in an email. “She will not be remembered in a way that so many beloved first ladies have been remembered.”

MEXICO CITY (AP) — A landslide caused by heavy rains has killed six people near Mexico City, authorities said.
The landslide on Monday night in Naucalpan, a community northwest of Mexico City, also affected a house and school, the State of Mexico government said in a statement. The victims were four men and two women. Another three people were injured and transported to a state hospital.
State Gov. Delfina Gómez ordered the deployment of rescue teams and security task forces to support affected families.
The deaths in Naucalpan occurred a few days after another landslide killed nine people on Saturday in Jilotzingo, west of Mexico City in the State of Mexico. A 3-month-old baby was among the victims. Two children, ages 10 and 12, and a 34-year-old woman were rescued. Several homes were affected and authorities had to evacuate more than 100 people for fear of further landslides.
The landslides and heavy rains have been pounding the State of Mexico since the start of the rainy season in late July. 
In cities like Chalco that have also experienced heavy torrential rains, the combination of unchecked growth and failing infrastructure have caused sewage-infused waters to invade streets, homes and businesses.",True

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Liover Peguero slashed a two-run double, Luis Ortiz pitched seven strong innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 on Wednesday night.
Ortiz (7-6) allowed one run on four hits with a walk and five strikeouts in seven innings. His only mistake was a second-inning pitch to Jake Bauers that Milwaukee’s designated hitter sent to the seats in right-center for his 12th homer of the season.
Peguero led all Pirates minor leaguers this season in hits, RBIs and doubles before being called up on Tuesday after Pittsburgh s urprisingly released first baseman Rowdy Tellez. The shortstop laced a ball to the notch in left-center against Freddy Peralta (11-9) in the fifth that drove in Yasmani Grandal and Nick Yorke, both of whom reached base after working full-count walks.
“When you work really hard and then you see the results, the results that you’ve be looking for, you just get excited,” Peguero said. “Right now, I just want more. I’m going to continue to keep improving out there and give everything I have, which is really exciting.”
Isiah Kiner-Falefa had the other two hits for Pittsburgh, a clean single in the fourth and an infield hit in the eighth. Aroldis Chapman recorded his 12th save after left fielder Bryan Reynolds threw out Willy Adames with two outs in the ninth when Adames tried to stretch a single into a double.
Ortiz, who began the season as a long reliever, has put together a compelling case that he deserves to stay in the rotation in 2025, a rotation that will include rookie sensation Paul Skenes. 


“After we broke camp and they told me I was going to be in the bullpen, all that was in my mind was to try and help the team in as many ways as possible,” said Ortiz, who will finish the year with a 3.32 ERA. “Whatever happens after that, it happens. The other thing I was focused on was to just work hard and give the team a good shot to win.” 
The right-hander has developed a deeper repertoire this season, adding a cutter to the mix that has helped him become more effective.
“That’s a new pitch,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “For how much it played and how much he was able to make that pitch better during a major league season is something that’s really important.”
Rhys Hoskins, William Contreras and Sal Frelick all singled for the NL Central champion Brewers, who are readying for their sixth playoff appearance in the last seven years.
Peralta has been among the major reasons why Milwaukee is heading back to the postseason. The 28-year-old right-hander has been a fixture near the top of the Brewers’ rotation that has seen 17 different players start at least one game.
“You talk about a pillar,” Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said. “We call those guys our pillars. But he did it on the field, too. He showed every single start and he gave us everything he got.”
Peralta was in October form for most of the night against Pittsburgh, retiring the first nine batters he faced. He ran into trouble with two outs in the fifth, which also happened to come when he was one strikeout away from reaching 200 for a second straight season. The 28-year-old admitted he was chasing the milestone against Grandal, Yorke and Peguero and it cost him.
“One of his better outings except for that little three-batter stretch where there’s two outs and he’s trying to punch guys out,” Murphy said. “Hopefully he learned a lesson.”
Murphy let Peralta go out for the top of the sixth, then pulled him after Peralta fanned Reynolds to get to 200. Next up is a bit of rest before the playoffs begin.
“I’m in a great position right now,” Peralta said. “I feel great. Awesome.”
The series wraps up on Thursday in Pittsburgh’s home finale. Aaron Civale (7-9, 4.53 ERA) starts for Milwaukee. Mitch Keller (11-11, 4.21) will make his final start of the season for the Pirates.

NEW YORK (AP) — Gunnar Henderson had three of Baltimore’s 12 hits in the first four innings, and the Orioles again prevented the New York Yankees from clinching the AL East title by holding on for a 9-7 victory Wednesday night despite another home run from Aaron Judge.
Colton Cowser drove in three runs for the playoff-bound Orioles, who dinged substitute starter Marcus Stroman early and improved to 8-4 against New York with one matchup left in their season series.
“We’re just focusing on us,” Henderson said. “I feel like we’re starting to get it going at the right time.”
Judge went deep for the fourth game in a row, connecting on his major league-leading 57th homer in a four-run ninth inning. 
The three-run shot off Matt Bowman upped Judge’s career-best total to 142 RBIs, also most in the majors, and shaved New York’s deficit to 9-7.
“No quit in the team there all the way till the end,” Judge said. “I never feel like we’re ever out of a game no matter the score.” 
Keegan Akin retired the next two batters for his third career save and first this year. 
Juan Soto also homered and knocked in three runs for New York, which could have wrapped up the AL East race with a victory over the Orioles either of the past two nights. Anthony Volpe had an RBI single.
“Nothing’s been easy for us this year. Shouldn’t expect it to be now. But we’ve kind of persevered and kind of grinded our way through all of it,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “We’ll be ready to go tomorrow.”


Baltimore moved within four games of the Yankees in the division standings with four remaining. Cedric Mullins went 3 for 4 with a walk, three runs scored and two stolen bases.
Assured at least an American League wild card, the second-place Orioles secured their second consecutive trip to the postseason Tuesday night when their 5-3 win at Yankee Stadium was paired with Minnesota’s loss to Miami nine minutes later.
Baltimore enjoyed a booze-filled bash in the visitors’ clubhouse afterward, but it was the Yankees who appeared a little hungover Wednesday.
Stroman (10-9) was a late replacement for injured left-hander Nestor Cortes and gave up six straight singles to begin the game — several of them not hit very hard — as the Orioles grabbed a 3-0 lead. 
Rookie outfielder Jasson Domínguez overran Cowser’s two-run single, a flyball that fell in the left-field corner. 
“He’s missed some plays that he should make,” Boone said.
Domínguez, a natural center fielder, said he lost the ball at the end.
“I have no excuse. That ball has to be caught like 100% of the time,” he said.
Ryan Mountcastle followed with an RBI single. Henderson’s two-run single with one out in the fourth chased Stroman from his first start since Sept. 10. He gave up 10 of Baltimore’s 17 hits — 14 were singles — and was charged with six runs.
Anthony Santander and Cowser added consecutive RBI doubles later in the inning.
“Right away just really good at-bats from the first inning,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. “We had a lot of clutch hits, kept the line moving. Thought our at-bats all night were really good and you can never score enough here. We almost saw it. So it was a great night for us offensively.”
Stroman had been moved to the bullpen for the final two weeks of the season because the Yankees had six healthy starters before Cortes went down. The veteran right-hander threw 64 pitches for a three-inning save Sept. 17 in Seattle. 
Handed an 8-1 lead, Orioles starter Zach Eflin walked a career-high five and was pulled after 4 2/3 innings. Jacob Webb (2-5) retired Jazz Chisholm Jr. with the bases loaded to end the fifth and worked 1 1/3 scoreless innings.
“It was a great win,” Eflin said. “Offense had my back.”
Orioles: RHP Grayson Rodriguez will miss the postseason because of right lat discomfort.
Yankees: Cortes had been scheduled to start, but he was scratched and placed on the 15-day injured list with a flexor strain in his pitching elbow. He and the Yankees are holding out hope he could return at some point in the postseason, but it didn’t sound likely.
A matchup of Cy Young Award winners Thursday night, when Baltimore RHP Corbin Burnes (15-8, 2.95 ERA) faces Gerrit Cole (7-5, 3.67) to conclude the three-game series.
In his only previous start at Yankee Stadium, Burnes threw eight hitless innings for Milwaukee last September. The right-hander has a 1.08 ERA this month and will try to become the first Orioles pitcher to win 16 games in a season since Chris Tillman in 2016. 
Cole went nine innings for the win last time out in Oakland, allowing one run and two hits with seven strikeouts.

Publication date:2024-09-23 07:00:00

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Any concerns Josh Allen had about how the Bills would perform following a 10-day break were eased during a 10-play opening drive that ended with James Cook scoring on a 6-yard touchdown run.
Buffalo kept on scoring. Allen threw four touchdown passes and the Bills scored TDs on each of their five first-half drives in a 47-10 win over a misfiring Trevor Lawrence and the unraveling Jacksonville Jaguars on Monday night.
“It feels good. I’ll tell you that,” said Allen, whose 11 games with four TD passes set a team record, surpassing Hall of Famer Jim Kelly.
“I think this could have easily been a game where we had 10 days off and let up on the gas. But didn’t sense that from our guys, a lot of urgency throughout the week,” he said of a team that hadn’t played since a 31-10 rout of Miami on Sept. 12. “We didn’t win it today. We won it in the last 10 days.”
Allen went 22 of 28 for 247 yards in the first 30 minutes alone, with completions to nine receivers. He only attempted two passes after halftime, finishing 23 of 30 for 263 yards before Mitchell Trubisky relieved him.
And he spread the wealth, completing touchdown passes to Dalton Kincaid, Keon Coleman, Khalil Shakir and Ty Johnson.
“Freak of nature, all those things,” Shakir said of Allen, whose 230 touchdowns (passing, rushing and receiving) are one short of matching Patrick Mahomes for most by a player in his first seven NFL seasons.


Buffalo’s defense limited Jacksonville to 70 yards, five first downs and a field goal in five first-half possessions. The game was essentially over when Allen completed a 16-yard TD pass to Johnson 19 seconds before halftime.

Safety Damar Hamlin contributed to the rout with his first career interception. He easily picked off Lawrence’s overthrown pass intended for rookie Brian Thomas Jr. Five plays later, Allen completed a 27-yard TD pass to Shakir, who caught the ball at the 22 and broke two tackles running up the right sideline for the score.
Hamlin’s interception came about 21 months after he went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field in a Monday night game at Cincinnati.
“We all know my last game and how that game went,” said Hamlin, a starter after spending last season as a backup. “So to be able to come all the way back from that, and have a special moment, it’s all God.”
The four-time defending AFC East champions are off to their first 3-0 start since 2020 and third since coach Sean McDermott took over in 2017. They have topped 30 points in each game.
The Jaguars are in free fall. They last opened 0-3 in 2021 under coach Urban Meyer, who was fired before the end of the season.
And if things couldn’t go any worse for the Jaguars, mechanical issues led to their flight being delayed out of Buffalo, the team announced.
Jacksonville’s latest defeat comes a week after Lawrence expressed his frustrations by saying “We suck right now” following an 18-13 loss to Cleveland. The Jaguars squandered leads of 14-0 and 17-7 in a season-opening loss at Miami.
On Monday, it was coach Doug Pederson’s turn to question his team.
“It’s really shocking. Very disappointed. You hate to say it, but the reality is we’re not very good right now,” Pederson said. “I need everybody to coach and play better. Let’s leave it at that.”
Lawrence finished 21 of 38 for 178 yards with a touchdown and interception. He’s lost eight straight starts dating to last season, and hasn’t won since he had 364 yards passing in a 24-21 victory at Houston on Nov. 26.
“I’m not playing my best right now and that’s frustrating,” Lawrence said. “It seems like everyone takes their turn in making a bad play at the wrong time, including myself. It seems really difficult to go forward. Can’t find that rhythm right now. We all have our share in it.”
After opening the second half with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Brenton Strange, Lawrence’s final two drives ended on downs.
He was yanked with 7:45 left and watched from the sideline with his hands on his collar as backup Mac Jones was sacked and lost a fumble three snaps into his first possession. That led to Ray Davis scoring on a 3-yard run.
More concerning is a Jaguars defense that couldn’t find a way to stop Allen. The Bills gained 288 yards, posted 19 first downs and converted 6 of 8 third-down chances and both fourth-down opportunities in the first half alone.
Buffalo’s 31-point lead at the half matched the third largest in team history, and its largest since leading Atlanta 38-7 on Nov. 22, 1992.
Von Miller had a sack to increase his total to 126 1/2 and move into a tie for 17th on the career list with Derrick Thomas, one ahead of Dwight Freeney.
Jacksonville: CB Jarrian Jones did not return after hurting his left shoulder on Buffalo’s opening drive. ... LB Foyesade Oluokun was ruled out with a foot injury. ... RT Anton Harrison was ruled out with a knee injury.
Bills: DB Cam Lewis returned after being evaluated for a head injury.
Jaguars: At Houston on Sunday.
Bills: Make their third straight prime-time appearance and open a stretch of three straight road games at Baltimore on Sunday night.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — Justin Herbert gave some optimism to Los Angeles Chargers fans after a tough three-day stretch.
Herbert said on Wednesday he is “feeling less pain” with his left ankle and that he is out of a walking boot. The fifth-year quarterback — who has a high ankle sprain — was a limited participant and did some work in 7-on-7 drills during practice as the 2-1 Chargers began preparations for Sunday’s game against the unbeaten Kansas City Chiefs.
“Compared to last Wednesday, I think we’re steps ahead of where we are,” Herbert said after practice. “It was painful during the game from the buildup of the hits and the toll on it. At this point, I’ve done a good job of rehabbing and getting treatment on it, and I think we’re taking steps forward.”
Herbert’s injury happened late in the third quarter of a 26-3 victory over Carolina on Sept. 15. The only activity he did in practice leading up to last Sunday’s game at Pittsburgh was some throwing on the side on Thursday.
He was cleared to play after taking some snaps and testing out the ankle a couple of hours before the game.
Despite limited mobility, Herbert completed his first nine passes and was 12 of 18 for 125 yards with a touchdown in the 20-10 loss before coming out midway through the third quarter.
With Herbert’s health improving, the bigger concern is who will be protecting him.
Offensive tackles Rashaun Slater (pectoral) and Joe Alt (knee) did not practice. Alt is expected to be out for Sunday with a sprained MCL while Slater is likely doubtful. Trey Pipkins, the starting left guard who could move to one of the tackle spots, also missed Wednesday due to a foot injury.


Foster Sarell or Alex Leatherwood could step into one of the tackle spots while Jamaree Salyer can play both tackle and guard.

The Chargers roster woes are not confined to the offensive side of the ball. Linebacker Joey Bosa did not practice due to a nagging hip issue and safety Derwin James Jr. is out due to a one-game suspension by the NFL.
Before practice coach Jim Harbaugh said he was disappointed about that the suspension was upheld.
Jon Runyan, the league’s vice president of football operations, pointed to James’ targeting of Steelers tight end Pat Freiermuth during the third quarter as the last straw.
James, who is in his seventh season, reached out to officials and the league office during the offseason and training camp for guidance on how to maintain his physical playing style within the NFL’s rules.
“The tape is Exhibit A. Watch his tackles,” Harbaugh said. “In my opinion, as I look at the tape, he is doing what the league is trying to get to, which is take the head out of the game, but you can’t take it out of the game because it is between the two shoulders. When you try to tackle with the shoulder the head is coming. To the best of his human ability, he is trying to do that.
“He is going out of his way, sometimes giving up yards so that he can not injure another player or hit them in the head.”
Harbaugh claimed “mitigating circumstances” to the play and said that Freiermuth stiff-armed James’ helmet, causing him to change course when he made contact. Harbaugh also thought the contact was with the forearm and shoulder, not the helmet.
“He is a shining star as a teammate and captain of this team. He is a shining star and example,” Harbaugh said. “He does not want to hurt anybody. He just wants to do it exactly how the NFL wants to have people tackled in this game. There’s no one I respect more.”
Elijah Molden, who already has one start this season, would be in line to take James’ spot in the lineup.

                Question: Who stole his 58th base of the season on September 28, 2024, becoming the first 50-50 player in MLB history?

DENVER (AP) — Shohei Ohtani had two hits and raised his average to .310 in his bid to overtake batting leader Luis Arraez and become the National League’s first Triple Crown winner since 1937, helping the playoff-bound Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Colorado Rockies 13-2 on Saturday night.
Ohtani went 2 for 5 and closed within four points of Arraez, who got a night off from San Diego and is hitting .314 going into the regular season’s final day.
Ohtani leads the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs. The last NL Triple Crown winner was Joe Medwick of the 1937 St. Louis Cardinals. The last to achieve the feat in the major leagues was Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera in 2012.
“It’s very unlikely but I would expect Arraez to play tomorrow,” manager Dave Roberts said of Ohtani overtaking Arraez. “We’ll see if Shohei can throw out another big day.”
In addition, Ohtani stole his 58th base of a season in which he became the first 50-50 player.
Teoscar Hernández and Kike Hernández each hit three-run homers for Los Angeles, which had 18 hits and has scored at least 11 runs in consecutive games for the first time since July 21-22 last year at Texas. Teoscar Hernández has 99 RBIs.
Teoscar Hernández and Ohtani can reach milestones Sunday.
“Hopefully he can get six hits like in Miami so he can at least compete and battle for the batting title and a Triple Crown,” Hernández said, thinking back to Ohtani’s three-homer, 10-RBIs game on Sept. 19. “For me if I get the opportunity I’m going to try my best, not only for the 100 RBIs but for the run for the team.”


Yoshinobu Yamamato (7-2) allowed two runs and four hits over five innings while striking out six, earning his first win since beating the Rockies on June 1. Yamamoto was making his fourth start after missing three months with a strained rotator cuff.
The Dodgers (97-64) clinched the majors’ best record and home-field advantage throughout the postseason when Philadelphia lost at Washington earlier Saturday.
“That was important for us, and that’s why we played hard,” Hernández said.
Ohtani singled in the first, grounded out in the second, walked and scored in the fifth and singled in the fifth. He flied out in the seventh and grounded out in the ninth.
Kike Hernández, who finished with three hits, hit a 430-foot homer to center in the second inning off of Antonio Senzatela (0-1) for a 4-1 lead. Teoscar Hernández’s career-high 33rd homer in the fifth made it 8-2.
Ezequiel Tovar hit his team-leading 26th home for Colorado (61-100), which reached the century mark in losses for the second straight season.
“It is bothersome, whether it’s loss No. 1, loss No. 50, you don’t like them,” manager Bud Black said. “You’ve got to look at perspective, where we are with our team and where we’re going. That’s the bigger picture throughout all this.”
Charlie Blackmon, who will retire Sunday after 14 years in the majors, all with the Rockies, was 1 for 4 and scored a run.
Dodgers: OF Kevin Kiermaier dislocated his left ring finger while sliding into second base. The training staff popped the finger back in place, Roberts said, adding “now it’s just sore.” ... 1B Freddie Freeman felt “much better,” according to Roberts. Freeman sprained his right ankle in the seventh inning of the NL West Division clincher against San Diego on Thursday night.
Rockies: OF Brenton Doyle was out of the lineup due to right knee tendinitis.
Dodgers RHP Landon Knack (2-5, 3.74) starts against Rockies RHP Ryan Feltner (3-10, 4.66) in Sunday’s regular-season finale.

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A Brazilian Supreme Court panel on Monday unanimously upheld the decision of one of its justices to block billionaire Elon Musk’s social media platform X nationwide, according to the court’s website.
The broader support among justices undermines the effort by Musk and his supporters to cast Justice Alexandre de Moraes as an authoritarian renegade who is intent on censoring political speech in Brazil. 
The panel that voted in a virtual session was comprised of five of the full bench’s 11 justices, including de Moraes, who last Friday ordered the platform blocked for refusing to name a local legal representative, as required by law. It will stay suspended until it complies with his orders and pays outstanding fines that as of last week exceeded $3 million, according to his decision.
The platform has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to block users, and has alleged that de Moraes wants an in-country legal representative so that Brazilian authorities can exert leverage over the company by having someone to arrest.
De Moraes also set a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($8,900) for people or companies using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access X. Some legal experts questioned the grounds for that decision and how it would be enforced, including Brazil’s bar association, which said it would request the Supreme Court review that provision.
But the majority of the panel upheld the VPN fine — with one justice opposing unless users are shown to be using X to commit crimes.
This story is featured in our One Notable Number series, which spotlights the key numbers leading our coverage.
Take a look at more Notable Numbers here.

Brazil is one of the biggest markets for X, with tens of millions of users. Its block marked a dramatic escalation in a monthslong feud between Musk and de Moraes over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation.


Over the weekend, many X users in Brazil said they felt disconnected from the world and began migrating en masse to alternative platforms, like Bluesky and Threads.
The suspension has also proceeded to set up a showdown between de Moraes and Musk’s satellite internet provider Starlink, which is refusing to enforce the justice’s decision.
“He violated the constitution of Brazil repeatedly and egregiously, after swearing an oath to protect it,” Musk wrote in the hours before the vote, adding a flurry of insults and accusations in the wake of the panel’s vote. On Sunday, Musk announced the creation of an X account to publish the justice’s sealed decisions that he said would show they violated Brazilian law.
But legal experts have said such claims don’t hold water, noting in particular that de Moraes’ peers have repeatedly endorsed his rulings — as they did on Monday. Although his actions are viewed by experts as legal, they have sparked some debate over whether one man has been afforded too much power, or if his rulings should have more transparency.
De Moraes’ decision to quickly refer his order for panel approval served to obtain “collective, more institutional support that attempts to depersonalize the decision,” Conrado Hübner, a constitutional law expert at the University of Sao Paulo, told The Associated Press.
It is standard for a justice to refer such cases to a five-justice panel, Hübner said. In exceptional cases, the justice also could refer the case to the full bench for review. Had de Moraes done the latter, two justices who have questioned his decisions in the past — and were appointed by former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — would have had the opportunity to object or hinder the vote’s advance.
X’s block already led de Moraes last week to freeze the Brazilian financial assets of Starlink as a means to force it to cover X’s fines, reasoning that the two companies are part of the same economic group. The company says it has more than 250,000 clients in Brazil.
Legal experts have questioned the legal basis of that move, and Starlink’s law firm Veirano has told the AP it has appealed the freeze. It declined to comment further.
In a show of defiance, Starlink informally told the telecommunications regulator Anatel that it will not block X access until its financial accounts are unfrozen, Anatel’s press office said in an email to the AP. Starlink didn’t respond to a request for comment.
“If I’m not mistaken, it was a WhatsApp message that the legal representative of Starlink sent to the president of Anatel, forwarding a message from the company in the United States,” said Arthur Coimbra, a board member of Anatel, on a video call from his office in Brasilia.
That communication doesn’t hold legal value as conclusive evidence of non-compliance but prompted the telecommunications regulator to conduct inspections on Monday.
Coimbra said Anatel would finish an inspection report by the end of the day and then send it to the Supreme Court. He added that the maximum sanction for a telecom company would be revocation of its license. If Starlink loses its license and continues providing service, it would be committing a crime. Anatel could seize equipment from Starlink’s ground stations in Brazil that ensure the quality of its internet service, he said.
The ground stations receive and transmit data between satellites and the Earth. When a user accesses the internet via satellite, the data request is sent to the satellite, which then forwards it to the ground station connected to the global internet network.
That means a shutdown of Starlink is likely, although enforcement will be difficult given the company’s satellites aren’t inside national territory, said Luca Belli, coordinator of the Technology and Society Center at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. It is popular in Brazil’s expansive rural and forested areas.
Anatel’s President Carlos Baigorri told local media GloboNews late Sunday afternoon that he has relayed Starlink’s decision to Justice de Moraes. 
“It is highly probable there is a political escalation,” because Starlink is “explicitly refusing to comply with orders, national laws,” said Belli, who is also a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation’s law school.
The arguments from Musk, a self-proclaimed “free-speech absolutist,” have found fertile ground with Brazil’s political right, who view de Moraes’ actions as political persecution against Bolsonaro’s supporters.
On Brazilian orders, X previously has shut down accounts including of lawmakers affiliated with Bolsonaro’s right-wing party and far-right activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy. X’s lawyers in April sent a document to the Supreme Court, saying that since 2019 it had suspended or blocked 226 users.
Bolsonaro and his allies have cheered on Musk for defying de Moraes. Supporters rallied in April along Rio de Janeiro’s Copacabana beach with a giant sign reading “Brazil Thanks Elon Musk.”
Earlier that month, de Moraes ordered an investigation into Musk over the dissemination of defamatory fake news and another probe over possible obstruction, incitement and criminal organization. 
Bolsonaro is also the target of a de Moraes probe over whether the former president had a role in inciting an attempted coup to overturn the results of the 2022 election that he lost.

Publication date:2024-09-11 07:00:00

BOSTON (AP) — Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday he is prepared to pursue contempt charges against Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre if he fails to show up at a hearing Thursday despite being issued a subpoena.
Sanders said de la Torre needs to answer to the American people about how he was able to reap hundreds of millions of dollars while Steward Health Care, which operated about 30 hospitals nationwide, had to file for bankruptcy in May. 
“This is something that is not going to go away,” Sanders told The Associated Press. “We will pursue this doggedly.”
Steward has been working to sell its more than a half-dozen hospitals in Massachusetts, but received inadequate bids for two other hospitals — Carney Hospital in Boston and Nashoba Valley Medical Center in the town of Ayer — both of which have closed as a result. A federal bankruptcy court last week approved the sale of Steward’s other Massachusetts hospitals.
“He has decided not to show up because he doesn’t want to explain to the American people how horrific his greed has become,” Sanders said. “Tell me about your yacht. Tell me about your fishing boat. I want to hear your justification for that. Tell that to the community where staff was laid off while you made $250 million.”
Sanders said that to hold de la Torre in contempt would require a vote by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which he chairs, or — depending on what action they take — a vote of the full Senate.


Lawyers de la Torre have said that he won’t testify before the committee investigating the Dallas-based hospital company because a federal court order prohibits him from discussing anything during an ongoing reorganization and settlement effort. 
Sanders said there are plenty of questions de la Torre could still address.
Lawyers for de la Torre also accused the committee of seeking to turn the hearing into “a pseudo-criminal proceeding in which they use the time, not to gather facts, but to convict Dr. de la Torre in the eyes of public opinion.”
“It is not within this Committee’s purview to make predeterminations of alleged criminal misconduct under the auspices of an examination into Steward’s bankruptcy proceedings, and the fact that its Members have already done so smacks of a veiled attempt to sidestep Dr. de la Torre’s constitutional rights,” the lawyers said in a letter to Sanders last week.
De la Torre hasn’t ruled out testifying before the committee at a later date — a suggestion Sanders described as “100% a delaying tactic.”
Sanders also said the committee has received no indication that de la Torre will change his mind and attend Thursday’s hearing, which will also include testimony from nurses who worked at two of the hospitals owned by Steward in Massachusetts.
““You have a guy becoming fabulously wealthy while bankrupting hospitals and denying low income and middle income folks the health care they so desperately need,” Sanders said. He said that more than a dozen patients have died in Steward hospitals as a result of inadequate staffing or shortages of medical equipment.
“When a hospital shuts down in a community, especially a low-income community, it’s a disaster. Where do people go? Where’s the nearest emergency room?” Sanders added.
The committee’s options include holding de la Torre in criminal contempt, which could result in a trial and jail time; or civil contempt, which would result in fines until he appears. Both would require a Senate vote.
De la Torre also refused invitations to testify at a Boston field hearing earlier this year chaired by Sen. Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts and also a member of the committee.",False

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Cam Heyward isn’t going anywhere.
The longtime Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle signed a three-year contract on Tuesday that runs through the 2026 season. Financial details were not disclosed.
The 35-year-old Heyward — a first-round pick by the Steelers in 2011 — was about to enter the final season of his current deal. He had stressed repeatedly during the offseason and training camp that he wanted to play beyond 2024 and do it in Pittsburgh, though he opened the door to going elsewhere if he and the only team he’s ever played for couldn’t come to terms.
Turns out, that won’t be necessary.
“How unlikely! Yet here we are,” Heyward posted on X while posing for a picture with Steelers general manager Omar Khan.
Heyward was selected as a defensive captain for the 10th time in his 14-year career on Monday, becoming only the third player in franchise history to reach that milestone. 
The six-time Pro Bowler, three-time All-Pro and 2023 Walter Payton Man of the Year winner is coming off an injury-filled season in which he had just two sacks in 11 games. He talked openly Monday about returning to the standard he’d set earlier this decade, when he was one of the best pass-rushing interior linemen in the league.
“I’ve had to eat (criticism) and absorb it,” Heyward said. “Everybody’s entitled to their opinion, but I want to make their opinion wrong, and I think I just look forward to playing good football.”
Heyward enters 2024 with 80 1/2 sacks, the most ever by a Steelers defensive tackle and the ninth most in NFL history by an interior defensive linemen.

HELSINKI (AP) — A white beluga whale named “Hvaldimir,” first spotted in Norway not far from Russian waters with a harness that ignited rumors he may be a Moscow spy, has been found dead. 
The Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported that the whale carcass was found floating at the Risavika Bay in southern Norway Saturday by a father and son who were fishing.
The beluga, named by combining the Norwegian word for whale — hval — and Russian President Putin’s first name Vladimir, was lifted out of the water with a crane and taken to a nearby harbor where experts will examine it. 
“Unfortunately, we found Hvaldimir floating in the sea. He has passed away but it’s not immediately clear what the cause of death is,” marine biologist Sebastian Strand told NRK, adding that no major external injuries were visible on the animal.
Strand, who has monitored Hvaldimir’s adventures for the past three years on behalf of the Norway-based Marine Mind non-profit organization, said he was deeply affected by the whale’s sudden death.
“It’s absolutely horrible,” Strand said. “He was apparently in good condition as of (Friday). So we just have to figure out what might have happened here.”
The 4.2-meter (14-foot) long and 1,225-kilogram (2,700-pound) whale was first spotted by fishermen near the northern island of Ingøya, not far from the Arctic city of Hammerfest, in April 2019 wearing a harness and what appeared to be a mount for a small camera and a buckle marked with text “Equipment St. Petersburg”.


That sparked allegations that the beluga was “a spy whale.” Experts said the Russian navy is known to have trained whales for military purposes. 
Over the years, the beluga was seen in several Norwegian coastal towns and it quickly became clear that he was very tame and enjoyed playing with people, NRK said.
NGO Marine Mind said on its site that Hvaldimir was very interested in people and responded to hand signals.
“Based on these observations, it appeared as if Hvaldimir arrived in Norway by crossing over from Russian waters, where it is presumed he was held in captivity,” it said. 
Norwegian media have speculated whether Hvaldimir could have been used as “a therapy whale” of some sort in Russia.",False

SEATTLE (AP) — Logan Gilbert took a perfect game into the sixth inning to cap the best season of his career and Cal Raleigh hit a record-setting two-run homer as the Seattle Mariners beat the Athletics 6-4 on Sunday in their final game representing Oakland. 
The final time for the A’s with “Oakland” across the front of their gray road uniforms was nearly a historic day for Gilbert. He was overpowering from the outset and retired the first 17 batters of the game before Nick Allen’s soft single into left field with two outs in the sixth inning. 
That was it for Gilbert, who struck out seven and finished the season with 208 2/3 innings pitched, becoming the first Seattle pitcher to lead baseball in innings for a season. Gilbert (9-12) finished with 220 strikeouts and lowered his ERA to 3.23. And while Detroit’s Tarik Skubal seems to be the consensus choice for the AL Cy Young Award, Gilbert should finish high in the voting. 
“I know I get a lot of time off so I was just going to leave it all out there. I felt like I at least owed that to the fans and I know I’m going to be wishing on a random day in December or January I was at T-Mobile (Park) pitching against whoever,” Gilbert said. 
Raleigh’s two-run homer to cap Seattle’s four-run fifth inning came on the final pitch from A’s starter Mitch Spence (8-10). It was Raleigh’s 34th of the season and 93rd in his career, passing Mike Piazza for the most home runs by a catcher in their first four seasons.


The homer also gave Raleigh 100 RBIs, the first catcher in franchise history to reach that mark.
“That was a really cool moment. The past couple of days my phone’s been blowing up, ‘Got to get to 100, got to get to 100.’ I’d obviously trade it in a heartbeat for a spot in the playoffs but that’ll be a cool little feat to look back on one day,” Raleigh said. 
Justin Turner added a two-run single and Victor Robles and Julio Rodríguez both capped hot Septembers with RBI hits. 
Seattle finished 85-77 after sweeping the A’s, but for the first time in several years, the final series was meaningless for the Mariners after being eliminated from playoff contention on Thursday. 
The final day for Oakland (69-93) was filled with appreciation and honor for the A’s, along with feelings of sadness the team no longer would represent the East Bay city next season. The A’s will relocate to Sacramento for the next few years before a planned move to Las Vegas. 
Fans of the green and gold turned out for the finale, starting “Let’s go Oakland” chants throughout the game, many of them wearing shirts or carrying signs imploring the A’s current ownership to sell the team. 
“The emotion of Thursday will never be matched, but today knowing the last game with the Oakland jersey, and the ‘Let’s go Oakland’ chants in the ninth inning as loud as they were in a visiting stadium was pretty impressive,” A’s manager Mark Kotsay said. 
Tyler Nevin had a two-run double in the seventh inning to make sure Oakland’s final game didn’t end in a shutout and Darell Hernaiz had a two-run double in the ninth. 
Baseball Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson threw out the ceremonial first pitch on the final day, wearing a half-A’s, half-Mariners jersey. While Henderson played the majority of his career in Oakland, he spent part of one season with Seattle in 2000.
Seattle finished the season with an unofficial total attendance of 2,554,868 after drawing 42,177 for the finale. That’s down slightly from last season when Seattle drew 2,690,418.
The A’s and Mariners will see each other again in Seattle to open next season on March 27, 2025.

KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Flooding and landslides caused by continuous rainfall has killed at least 66 people in Nepal, and a further 69 are missing, officials said Saturday.
Rain has been pouring down since Friday night and is expected to continue over the weekend. 
Home Ministry spokesperson Rishiram Tiwari told reporters there were 66 people reported dead across the country, of whom 34 were in the capital, Kathmandu. 
Sixty people were injured and 3,010 rescued across the Himalayan nation, he added.
He said all divisions of security forces in the country including the army have been ordered to help in the rescue efforts.
Several roads were blocked by landslides triggered by the rainfall.

Three highways, including the key Prithvi highway, connecting Kathmandu to the rest of the country have been blocked by landslides, and heavy equipment is being used to try open the routes, said Tiwari.
The government had issued flood warnings across the Himalayan nation warning of massive rainfall.
Buses were banned from traveling at night on highways and cars were discouraged. Security forces were ordered to high alert.
Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak told reporters that officials are still collecting information on the effects of the flooding.
“The government’s priority right now is to rescue the people and help those who have been affected,” Lekhak said.

Parts of Kathmandu were inundated by swollen rivers with many houses flooded and residents forced to move to top floors. A huge area on the southern side of the city was mostly flooded. An army helicopter was used to pick up four people who were unable to leave their houses. 
Most of Kathmandu was without power and internet for a period of time.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Florida law enforcement officials will launch their own criminal investigation into the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump that will run parallel to the federal probe, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday.
The governor said Florida prosecutors will pursue the most serious charges available under state law, including attempted murder, in the state-level investigation into Ryan Wesley Routh, who was charged Monday with federal firearms offenses.
“We have a very strong interest in holding this suspect accountable,” DeSantis told reporters.
It’s not uncommon for state and federal law enforcement agencies to run simultaneous investigations into crimes, as states may be able to bring charges that are unavailable at the federal level — and vice versa.
At a news conference, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says one of the reasons Florida will do its own investigation is because there were few answers after the probe into the earlier Trump assassination attempt.
Routh is charged at the federal level so far only with gun crimes, but additional charges are possible as Justice Department prosecutors seek an indictment from a grand jury. Prosecutors will often quickly bring the first charges they can and then add more serious charges later as the investigation unfolds.
“We will spare no resource in this investigation,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday during an event at the Justice Department.
Markenzy Lapointe, the top federal prosecutor for the Southern District of Florida, declined to comment on the state probe.


DeSantis said it will be handled by Florida’s office of statewide prosecution, overseen by Attorney General Ashley Moody.
The FBI has interviewed the suspect’s family members, friends and colleagues and is working to collect evidence. Authorities have requested search warrants seeking access to a video recording device, cellphones, a vehicle and electronics at Routh’s previous addresses.
FBI agents were spotted Tuesday at Routh’s home in Kaaawa, Hawaii. FBI Honolulu office spokeswoman Sarah Rice said they were carrying out “court-authorized law enforcement activity.” She said the court documents authorizing the activity were sealed.
No motive has been disclosed, and Routh invoked his right to an attorney when questioned, officials said.
Coming just weeks after a July 13 shooting at a Pennsylvania campaign rally where Trump was grazed by a gunman’s bullet, the latest assassination attempt accelerated concerns that violence continues to infect American presidential politics.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who is Trump’s Democratic opponent in November, spoke with him Tuesday to express how grateful she is that he is safe, according to the White House.
Routh, 58, was arrested Sunday after authorities spotted a gun poking out of shrubbery on the golf course where Trump was playing. Routh camped outside the golf course with food and a rifle for nearly 12 hours, lying in wait for the former president before a Secret Service agent thwarted the potential attack and opened fire.
Routh did not fire any shots, never had Trump in his line of sight and sped away, leaving behind a digital camera, a backpack, a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope and a plastic bag containing food, officials said. He was arrested in a neighboring county.
Routh’s attorney declined to comment after he appeared briefly in federal court Monday, when a judge ordered that he remain locked up after prosecutors argued that he was a flight risk. Routh has been moved from the Palm Beach County jail to the federal lockup in Miami. A federal magistrate set additional hearings for later this month.
What to know about the 2024 Election
In the federal case, Routh is charged with illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions, including two charges of possessing stolen goods in 2002 in North Carolina. The other charge alleges that the weapon’s serial number was obliterated and unreadable to the naked eye, in violation of federal law.
Federal investigators are examining Routh’s large online footprint, which suggests a man of evolving political viewpoints, including recently an apparent disdain for Trump, as well as intense outrage at global events concerning China and especially Ukraine.
“You are free to assassinate Trump,” Routh wrote of Iran in an apparently self-published 2023 book titled “Ukraine’s Unwinnable War,” which described the former president as a “fool” and “buffoon” for both the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and the “tremendous blunder” of leaving the Iran nuclear deal.

Palestinian health officials say Israeli strikes in the occupied West Bank killed six people, including the son of a prominent jailed militant.
Israel said all of those killed were militants who had been involved in attacks.
Israel has been carrying out large-scale raids in the territory over the past week that it says are aimed at dismantling militant groups and preventing attacks. The Palestinians fear a widening of the war in Gaza.
A strike overnight in the northern West Bank town of Tubas killed five people, including Mohammed Zubeidi, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Thursday, without saying whether they were civilians or combatants.
His father, Zakaria Zubeidi, was a well-known militant commander during the second Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s and took part in a rare jail break in 2021 before being arrested and returned to prison days later.
The military said the younger Zubeidi had taken part in attacks against Israeli forces in the West Bank and that he was with a militant cell when he was targeted.
It said another fighter was killed in an airstrike in the built-up Al-Faraa refugee camp after hurling a firebomb at Israeli forces. The military released a video that it said showed the exchange. It said forces also uncovered roadside bombs in the camp, which dates back to the 1948 Mideast war surrounding Israel’s creation.
Here’s the latest:


UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations says the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains “beyond catastrophic,” with more than one million Palestinians not receiving any food rations in August and a 35% drop in people getting daily cooked meals.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the U.N. humanitarian office attributed the sharp reduction in cooked meals partly to multiple evacuation orders from Israeli security forces that forced at least 70 of 130 kitchens to either suspend or relocate their operations.
He said the U.N.’s humanitarian partners also lacked sufficient food supplies to meet requirements for the second straight month in central and southern Gaza, “and will only be able to provide one food parcel to families in central and southern Gaza during the September distribution cycle.”
Dujarric said critical shortages of commodities are also due to ongoing hostilities, insecurity, damaged roads, the breakdown of law and order, and access limitations.
In the West Bank, he said, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs known as OCHA reports that “Israeli forces continue to utilize lethal war-like tactics, including airstrikes, in Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarm.”
Dujarric said this has resulted in additional fatalities and injuries on Thursday, and destruction or damage to more roads and infrastructure.
“Medical facilities have been virtually besieged for over a week now, with heavy restrictions imposed on the movement of ambulances and medical staff,” Dujarric said.
TEL AVIV — Hundreds of people marched silently through the streets of Tel Aviv carrying 27 mock coffins to represent the 27 hostages who were captured alive on Oct. 7 and whose bodies were recovered by the Israeli military during the past nearly 11 months of fighting in Gaza.
The protesters marched through major streets in Tel Aviv on Thursday night, solemnly striking a bell as the flag-draped coffins were slowly brought through the streets. The country is reeling from the discovery of the bodies of six Israeli hostages, who Israel says were killed by Hamas just before they were discovered by Israeli troops.
“Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death, her and all the hostages,” said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat, one of six hostages killed and whose body was recovered. “She was abandoned to her death by the government could have brought her back, 327 days she was there, in Gaza, in captivity, there were 327 opportunities to bring her back and every single one was missed.”
In angry public statements, hostage families have accused Netanyahu of blocking a deal and potentially sacrificing their loved ones’ lives for the sake of holding the border strip.
Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets in recent days, calling for a deal and saying time is running out to bring home the hostages alive.
BEIRUT — Senior Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday of deliberately stalling cease-fire negotiations, and urged the U.S. and the international community to put more pressure on Israel.
In a recorded speech released on Hamas’ official accounts, al-Hayya — who has been heading the militant group’s delegation to the cease-fire talks — reiterated the group’s stance that it will not consider any proposed deal that does not entail a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and particularly from the Philadelphi corridor, a key area along Gaza’s border with Egypt.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in recent weeks insisted that Israel will maintain forces in the corridor, saying it is necessary to halt weapons smuggling. The condition was not included in previous versions of the cease-fire proposal before the current round of talks. 
Egypt, which along with the U.S. and Qatar is mediating the talks, has also been strongly opposed to Israel maintaining a military presence on the border.
Al-Hayya said Hamas “will not allow any agreement that legitimizes an Israeli presence on any part of Gaza or fails to secure our people’s rights.”
“We reject going back to square one or getting caught in a vicious cycle that serves Netanyahu’s goals,” he said.
DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian health officials say an Israeli strike on a tent camp killed four men and wounded two children.
The strike early Thursday hit an encampment near the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Hospital officials confirmed the toll and an Associated Press reporter saw the bodies.
The Israeli military said it carried out a precise strike on a command and control center operated by Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group that was embedded in a humanitarian zone.
The nearly 11-month-long war has displaced about 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Israel has ordered mass evacuations into so-called humanitarian zones but occasionally carries out strikes there as well.
A woman who identified herself as Umm Mohammed Wadi said she was staying in a tent close to where the strike occurred.
“What did they do to be struck while sleeping?” she said. “No hospital is safe, nor any school or home.”
Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians.
The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 40,861 Palestinians have been killed and more than 94,000 wounded since the start of the war. It does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its toll.
The war began after Hamas launched a wide-scale attack into Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire in November.",False

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — An absentee ballot drop box that the mayor of a central Wisconsin city removed a week ago was back in place on Monday.
The Wausau city clerk said the box was available outside of city hall “for residents to submit absentee ballots, payments, and other important city requests as was intended.”
Mayor Doug Diny removed the drop box on Sept. 22 without consulting with the clerk, who has the authority under a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling legalizing drop boxes to make one available. They are not mandatory in the state.
The incident is the latest example in swing state Wisconsin of the fight over whether communities will allow voters to use absentee ballot drop boxes. The Wisconsin Supreme Court in July ruled that drop boxes are legal, but left it up to local communities to decide whether to use them.
More than 60 towns, villages and cities in nine counties have opted out of using the boxes for the presidential election in November, according to a tally by the group All Voting is Local. Drop boxes are being embraced in heavily Democratic cities including Milwaukee and Madison.
Diny has said he wants the full Wausau city council discuss whether one should be offered. Absentee ballots began being mailed to voters on Sept. 19 ahead of the Nov. 5 election.
Wausau clerk Kaitlyn Bernarde said in a statement that the box has been secured to the ground in accordance with guidance from the Wisconsin Elections Commission and the United States Election Assistance Commission. The box was not attached to the ground when the mayor took it a week ago.


Diny’s action spurred the Marathon County district attorney to request an investigation from the state Department of Justice. The drop box was locked and no ballots were in it when Diny took it, according to both the mayor and city clerk.
Diny, who distributed a photo of himself carting the drop box away, insists he did nothing wrong. 
Drop boxes were widely used in 2020, fueled by a dramatic increase in absentee voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 500 drop boxes were set up in more than 430 Wisconsin communities for the election that year, including more than a dozen each in Madison and Milwaukee. Drop boxes were used in 39 other states during the 2022 election, according to the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project.",False

CHICAGO (AP) — Tyler Soderstrom homered and Zack Gelof hit a tiebreaking double in the eighth inning as the Oakland Athletics beat the Chicago Cubs 5-3 on Wednesday, putting the Milwaukee Brewers in the playoffs.
Chicago’s loss clinched the NL Central title for the Brewers, their third in four years. Milwaukee became the first major league team to reach the 2024 postseason.
The 22-year-old Soderstrom drove in two runs and scored two more to help Oakland to its first series victory over the Cubs since 2013. Brent Rooker was 2 for 3 with an RBI and two walks.
Tyler Ferguson (4-2) threw a hitless seventh for the win, and Michel Otañez struck out two in the eighth. Mason Miller earned his 27th save, setting a franchise rookie record.
“Coming into the season and through spring training, we saw the confidence, we saw the demeanor and the ability to handle that high-leverage situation,” A’s manager Mark Kotsay said. “We started him out right at the beginning of the year in that closing role, and he’s just had such a great season doing it. The confidence that this club has turning the ball over to him feels really good.”
Oakland (67-86) has the third-worst record in the American League. But a 5-4 trip against the Astros, White Sox and Cubs, along with a 30-25 mark since the All-Star break, has given the A’s confidence as they look to finish the season strong and build momentum for 2025.
“At this point of the year, obviously out of playoff contention, it’d be pretty easy to just mail that one in in the fifth or sixth inning and try to get back on the road and get back home, but that’s not the character of this group,” Rooker said. “The group of guys in here is going to go out there and fight until the last out and try to win every game possible, and that’s what we did.”


Playing his fourth game since returning from a left wrist injury, Soderstrom hit a home run in the fourth for his first longball since June 28 to give Oakland a 1-0 lead.
The Cubs were held to two hits through four innings, but finally broke through in the fifth. With the bases loaded, Dansby Swanson and Seiya Suzuki hit RBI singles, and Cody Bellinger’s sacrifice fly made it 3-1.
The outburst ended rookie starter Brady Basso’s day after 4 2/3 innings. He gave up three runs on six hits and two walks with five strikeouts.
Soderstrom and Tyler Nevin each singled in the seventh, and Lawrence Butler and Rooker brought them home to tie it.
Gelof’s run-scoring double in the eighth regained the lead for Oakland. Gelof advanced to third on the throw, putting him in position to score on a hard-hit grounder to second by Soderstrom that gave the A’s a 5-3 advantage.
Cubs starter Justin Steele had a short return to action in his first game back from elbow tendinitis, going just 2 2/3 innings. He allowed two hits and three walks to go along with a strikeout, then was taken out after loading the bases in the third.
Ethan Roberts took over for the final out of the inning, and zero earned runs were attached to Steele. Cubs manager Craig Counsell said before the game that he expected Steele’s start to be short.
Nate Pearson (2-2) took the loss after giving up two runs in 1 1/3 innings.
Cubs: Steele and RHP Jorge López were activated from the 15-day injured list. Chicago optioned RHP Daniel Palencia and RHP Jack Neely to Triple-A Iowa. Steele last pitched in August before starting Wednesday. … Counsell on RHP Hunter Wesneski, out since July 19 with a forearm injury: “He’ll be active when we feel like there’s a need and it’s appropriate, but he’s ready to go.”
Athletics: RHP J.T. Ginn (0-1, 4.94 ERA) pitches Friday at home against the Yankees.
Cubs: RHP Javier Assad (7-5, 3.27 ERA) starts Thursday’s series opener against Washington.

PHOENIX (AP) — Eugenio Suárez hit a game-ending single off the right-field wall, just a few feet shy of a grand slam, capping a three-run 10th inning that led Arizona Diamondbacks over the Milwaukee Brewers 11-10 on Sunday to avoid a series sweep.
Arizona wasted a 5-0, fifth-inning lead, then overcame an 8-5 deficit with two runs in the seventh and Suárez’s sacrifice fly in the eighth.
“Crazy game,” Suárez said. “They gave me that opportunity.”
Jackson Chourio had a career-high five RBIs, including a two-out, opposite-field, two-run triple down the right-field line against Justin Martinez that put Milwaukee back ahead 10-8 in the 10th. 
While Milwaukee closer Devin Williams warmed up twice, manager Pat Murphy did not bring him in for the bottom half. Murphy said Williams had limited availability.
“If you put him in the game with no outs, then potentially he’s got to throw a high number of pitches,” Murphy said. “That would have been four out of six (days) and then he wouldn’t be available for awhile.”
Joel Payamps got one out in the seventh. Murphy said Payamps had forearm tightness and otherwise he would have remained in for the eighth.
“That changed everything,” Murphy said.
Chourio tripled after right-hander Justin Martinez intentionally walked left-handed-hitting Brice Turang to bring up the right-handed-hitting Chourio.
“I walked him right into their hottest hitter. That’s on me,” acting manager Jeff Banister said. “It came down to the number of pitches. Turang is a contact-type guy.”


Adrian Del Castillo singled off Jared Koenig (8-4) leading off the 10th, driving in automatic runner Kevin Newman. Singles by Ketel Marte and Corbin Carroll loaded the bases, and Koenig forced in the tying run when he hit Christian Walker with a cutter.
Blake Walston (1-0) struck out Willy Adames to strand Chourio at third to get his first big league win in his fourth appearance.
Arizona (83-66) is in the second NL wild card position, 1 1/2 games behind San Diego (85-65) and two games ahead of New York (81-68) and Atlanta (81-68). The Mets lost 2-1 in Philadelphia on Sunday afternoon while the Braves fell 9-2 to the Dodgers later Sunday.
The Diamondbacks improved to 37-1 this year when taking a five-run lead. Milwaukee has not overcome a five-run deficit to win on the road since May 11, 2018.
Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo missed the game to attend a memorial service in California for former major leaguer Billy Bean. MLB’s senior vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion, Bean died of leukemia Aug. 6 at age 60. Bench coach Jeff Banister filled in for Lovullo.
Gold Glove catcher Gabriel Moreno was activated from the injured list by Arizona and pinch hit in the seventh, reaching when he grounded into a forceout. Moreno had been sidelined since Aug. 5 with a left adductor strain. Right-hander Paul Sewald was put on the 15-day injured list with left neck discomfort.
Suárez and Josh Bell hit RBI singles in the first and Pavin Smith had a three-run double in the third off DL Hall, who allowed five runs, five hits and three walks in three innings.
Chourio’s 21st homer, a three-run drive, cut the deficit in the fifth against Zac Gallen and Haase hit a two-run homer off Kevin Ginkel in a four-run sixth that included a two-run double by Willy Adames, who has a career-best 109 RBIs.
Sal Frelick boosted the lead to 8-5 with an RBI single in the seventh, but Arizona closed in the bottom half when Gerardo Perdomo hit an RBI single and scored on Randal Grichuk’s double.
Carroll singled in the eighth, stole second, took third on a wild pitch and scored on Suárez’s sacrifice fly
Walston was recalled from Triple-A Reno and reliever Dylan Floro was designated for assignment. Floro was acquired from Washington at the July trade deadline and had a 9.37 ERA in 16 1/3 innings for the Diamondbacks.
Brewers: RHP Aaron Civale (6-8, 4.57) starts Monday at home against Philadelphia LHP Ranger Suárez (12-6, 3.05).
Diamondbacks: LHP Jordan Montgomery (8-6, 6.25) returns to the rotation Monday night at Colorado. Rockies RHP Antonio Senzatela, coming back from Tommy John surgery, makes his first start since May 10, 2023.

Publication date:2024-09-11 07:00:00

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Receiver Puka Nacua, guard Steve Avila and offensive tackle Joe Noteboom were placed on injured reserve Wednesday by the Los Angeles Rams, and coach Sean McVay acknowledged all three players could be out longer than four games.
Even with the Rams’ bye week providing a fifth week of recovery into mid-October for the trio, McVay isn’t sure when his team will be whole again after a series of significant injury setbacks already this season.
“Each of those three guys have unique injuries that, as of right now, it could keep them out longer than that,” McVay said. “And so we’ll see. ... Let’s not place expectations on when they’re going to come back, because these guys are so conscientious. Let’s allow them to be ready to go whenever their body says, and when the doctors do say. I know they’re going to accelerate it and be ready as quickly as possible.”
When asked if this season already feels a bit like the Rams’ injury-ruined Super Bowl title defense season in 2022, McVay replied flatly and sarcastically: “I don’t remember that year.”
Nacua aggravated a sprained ligament in his right knee during the first half of Los Angeles’ 26-20 overtime loss at Detroit last weekend. The Rams were still competitive while players went down left and right with injuries, and they even scored 17 consecutive points down the stretch before the Lions’ offense took control.
McVay said he threw out his entire offensive game plan and worked with Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp on new ways to move the ball without their starting offensive line — and it almost worked.


“The game was such an outlier for how we had to play, how we had to adjust,” McVay said. “I’ve never been a part of circumstances quite like that, but that’s also probably as proud as I’ve been of a group’s ability to adjust. The guys seamlessly handled that.”

The long-term absence of Nacua, the most productive rookie receiver in NFL history last season, leaves another major hole in a unit already playing behind a patchwork offensive line.
Avila sprained a ligament in his knee in the first half in Detroit, while Noteboom sprained his ankle. The Rams already were playing without both of their starting offensive tackles: Left tackle Alaric Jackson is suspended for one more week, and right tackle Rob Havenstein is hoping to return after missing the season opener with a persistent ankle injury, although he was quite limited in practice Wednesday.
What’s more, right guard Kevin Dotson missed practice to rest his sprained ankle, although the Rams are optimistic he’ll play when they travel to Arizona on Sunday hoping to avoid the franchise’s first 0-2 start to a season since 2011.
The Rams are filling their roster gaps with newcomers, signing offensive lineman Dylan McMahon off Philadelphia’s practice squad and adding veteran offensive lineman Geron Christian. Los Angeles also re-signed two former Rams to the practice squad this week, reuniting with cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon and offensive tackle Ty Nsekhe.
Cornerback Cobie Durant also missed Wednesday’s practice with an injured toe. Since the Rams already are without starting cornerback Darious Williams on injured reserve, they re-signed Witherspoon, an eight-year NFL veteran who made three interceptions while starting all 17 games for the Rams last season.
McMahon is a rookie chosen in the sixth round by the Eagles last spring, and McVay said the Rams had their eye on the N.C. State product all year.
Christian played in 58 games over the past six seasons with Washington, Houston, Kansas City and Cleveland. He started nine games at left tackle last season for the Browns, and he spent this year’s training camp and preseason with Tennessee before being released late last month.
Nsehkhe started eight games for the Rams in that ill-fated 2022 season before spending last year with Cleveland. The veteran tackle, who turns 39 next month, played for the St. Louis Rams in 2012, and he also played for McVay when the coach was Washington’s offensive coordinator in 2015 and 2016.
“I thought he played really well in ‘22,” McVay said. “He’s timeless. He’s still doing his thing.”

As the sun bleeds into daylight or fades toward night, AP photographer Michael Probst is often on the hunt for serene scenes near his home in Frankfurt, Germany that evoke a sense of wonder.
Nature comes alive in the vibrant yellow of a pollen-laden bee approaching a sunflower or a fuzzy-headed gosling poking from the plumage on its mother’s back. Two toothy Icelandic horses with shaggy manes playfully bite each other while their large eyes seem fixed on the camera lens.

Probst, who has worked for The Associated Press for 30 years, focused on finding a different perspective on life once his three children were grown up and he could work in the early or late hours of the day when the light is best.
“I thought there must be more in news photography than soccer, business and government press conferences,” Probst said. “With all the trouble in the world, I wanted to show the nice things.”
Among the many images he’s captured when not on traditional assignments: a wild boar bounds through a blur of deep grass; a nimble-footed hare turns tail and hops away and a stork with its wings spread wide plunges from its nest.

His environmental images may show wildlife but the sign of humans is never far away.
A bee alights on a blood-red poppy with city skyscrapers looming in the distance. A closer look at fields under a gauzy amber mist at daybreak reveals a commuter train. A shot from a drone reveals a heart-shaped pond hidden by a row of trees from cars speeding past on the highway next to it.

It can take hours for Probst to get the right shot and can require other challenges, such as acquiring permission from farmers and landowners to access private property.
Probst aims to rise by 4:30 a.m. in the summer to shoot sunrise. In the winter, he tolerates cold that can dip to minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit).
Whether a photo is good or not, he said, comes down to personal preference.
“I never thought about why photos work,” he said. “I like a picture or not without being able to explain why. I rely on my taste.”

Publication date:2024-09-15 07:00:00

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The struggles Sam Darnold endured through his first five years in the NFL relegated him to backup duty last season with San Francisco, yet another prospect failing to perform like a premium draft pick.
He’s been quickly regaining his status in Minnesota. 
Darnold passed for 268 yards and two touchdowns against his former team, including a 97-yard strike in the second quarter to Justin Jefferson, and an actively attacking defense again fueled the Vikings in a 23-17 victory over the 49ers on Sunday.
“Sam has been making a whole bunch of great decisions. We’ve got to just keep trusting in him to make those decisions,” Jefferson said.
Chief among those smart choices was to join the Vikings, who needed a veteran to stabilize the offense before turning it over to rookie J.J. McCarthy — who suffered a season-ending knee injury last month.
“The amount of work that goes into that position on your quarterback journey when everybody decides that you can not play — we always believed in him,” coach Kevin O’Connell said. “It felt awesome to watch him go do that thing.”
Darnold went 17 for 26 with one interception for the Vikings (2-0), who got three field goals by rookie Will Reichard and had 146 rushing yards in their most productive (6.1 yards per attempt) ground game in nearly three years.
Blake Cashman had 13 tackles, three passes defensed and a sack and Patrick Jones II had two of the six sacks of Brock Purdy, who threw two interceptions and found himself playing from behind all game.


“We’ve got the players. We’ve got the scheme. We’ve got what it takes,” said Purdy, who went 28 for 36 for 319 yards. “It’s dropping back and executing and getting the ball into guys’ hands.”

Overcoming two red zone turnovers that the 49ers (1-1) turned into touchdowns and a quadriceps injury that forced Jefferson out of the game in the third quarter, Darnold and the Vikings put on a show in his home debut after he backed up Purdy last season for the NFC champions.
But as far as a statement win by a team pegged for last place in the NFC North by most prognostications or a told-you-so performance by a quarterback on the scrap heap of public opinion, well, he’s not there.
“I don’t get into narratives like that,” Darnold said. “I think the biggest thing for us is just continuing to take it one day at a time.” 
Jordan Mason rushed 20 times for 100 yards and a touchdown for the 49ers in another fine fill-in for All-Pro Christian McCaffrey, who will miss at least two more games with lower leg injuries.
The Vikings might well have won in a runaway were it not for Fred Warner, the three-time All-Pro linebacker who made his NFL debut for the 49ers in the season opener at Minnesota in 2018.
Warner, who finished with nine tackles and two passes defensed, made a diving interception at the San Francisco 10 to thwart a promising drive with the Vikings leading 10-0. The 49ers seized the momentum with a five-play march capped with a touchdown pass from Purdy to George Kittle.
Then in the fourth quarter with the Vikings ahead 20-7, Warner jarred the ball loose from Aaron Jones at the 1-yard line at the end of an 18-yard run.
Kittle had seven catches for 76 yards to post the third-most receiving yards (6,390) by a tight end in NFL history at the 100-game mark for his career. Rob Gronkowski (7,112) and Travis Kelce (6,762) were the only ones with more.
San Francisco lost for the eighth straight time in Minnesota, including for the second straight year after a 22-17 loss in Week 7 on a Monday night last season. The most recent win here was in 1992.
The Vikings set up their first field goal with a blocked punt by C.J. Ham, the ninth-year fullback and special teams stalwart. Theo Jackson scooped it up for a 37-yard return to the San Francisco 24.
49ers: S Talanoa Hufanga (knee) missed a second straight game. His backup, Odum, was the last line of defense on Jefferson’s TD. ... Coach Kyle Shanahan said “nobody knows” when McCaffrey will be back. 
Vikings: WR Jordan Addison (ankle) was inactive after getting injured in the game last week. ... Rookie OLB Dallas Turner left with a knee injury that wasn’t deemed serious, O’Connell said.
49ers: Visit the Los Angeles Rams next Sunday. The 49ers had a 10-game regular-season winning streak against their division rival, excluding the NFC championship game in 2021-22, that ended with a 21-20 loss to the Rams on Jan. 7, 2024. That was Darnold’s only start for the 49ers.
Vikings: Host Houston on Sept. 22. They’re 5-0 all time against the Texans.

DEKALB, Ill. (AP) — Upton Bellenfant kicked a 37-yard field goal in overtime to give Buffalo a 23-20 victory over No. 23 Northern Illinois on Saturday.
The Huskies (2-1, 0-1 Mid-American Conference), playing for the first time since winning at then-No. 5 Notre Dame two weeks ago, managed just six points in the second half. Buffalo (3-1, 1-0), which began playing at the FBS level in 1999, beat a ranked opponent for the second time in its history.
“To me, it was just another kick,” said Bellenfant, who became Buffalo’s starting kicker just last week. “Kind of a magic story out there. Everything went right.
“It really gives us hope we can go undefeated the rest of the season.”
The Bulls led 20-17 after linebacker Shaun Dolac’s interception and 53-yard return set up a field goal, but the Huskies tied it with a 13-play drive that ended with Kanon Woodill’s 27-yard field goal with 26 seconds to play.
“As a defense, we buckled it down but we know we can count on the offense when it counts,” Dolac said. “They scored, they tied the game up and the rest is history.”
Woodill, who booted the game-winner at Notre Dame, missed a pair of field goal tries, including a 42-yarder that was blocked in overtime. That set up the winning kick from Bellenfant, who was 3 for 3 on the day.
“We were prepared to play but didn’t make the plays necessary to put ourselves in a position to win,” said Huskies coach Thomas Hammock, whose team also lost a fumble. “The only way we can lose the game is if we turn the ball over, and that’s what we did.”


Buffalo’s Pete Lembo, a head coach again after nine years as an assistant at four schools, said his players deserved all the credit.
“For them to be rewarded with a signature win like this, this early in our tenure is a big deal,” Lambo said.
C.J. Ogbonna was 10 for 17 for 107 yards and a touchdown for the Bulls. His 46-yard scoring toss to Victor Snow early in the third quarter got Buffalo within 14-10. Al-Jay Henderson’s 36-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter tied it at 17.
Antario Brown rushed for 73 yards and a pair of touchdowns for the Huskies.
He scored on a short run near the end of the first quarter and again on a 14-yard scamper late in the second that gave the Huskies a 14-3 halftime lead.
Ethan Hampton went 23 of 43 for 194 yards and an interception for Northern Illinois.
Buffalo’s only other victory against a ranked opponent came in the 2008 MAC championship game, when it beat No. 14 Ball State.
Buffalo: The Bulls looked lost offensively in the first half after averaging just 1.1 yards per carry but regrouped and kept the Huskies out of the end zone the rest of the way.
Northern Illinois: The defensive line that gave Notre Dame fits didn’t disappoint. The Huskies’ offense still needs some work, however, if they hope to match fellow MAC contender Toledo, which scored 41 points at Mississippi State last weekend.
The Huskies probably will fall out of the AP Top 25, but get another chance to show they belong when they visit N.C. State next weekend.
Buffalo: At Connecticut next Saturday.
Northern Illinois: At N.C. State next Saturday.

McALESTER, Okla. (AP) — Oklahoma executed a man Thursday for his role in the 1992 fatal shooting of a convenience store owner after the governor again rejected a recommendation from the state’s parole board to spare a death row inmate’s life.
Emmanuel Littlejohn, 52, received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and was declared dead at 10:17 a.m. 
“A jury found him guilty and sentenced him to death,” Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement explaining why he declined to commute Littlejohn’s sentence to life in prison without parole. “As a law and order governor, I have a hard time unilaterally overturning that decision.” 
Stitt has granted clemency only once out of the five times that the parole board has recommended it during Stitt’s nearly six years in office. Oklahoma has carried out 14 executions under Stitt, having resumed them in 2021 after a more than six-year hiatus. 
In voting 3-2 last month to recommend clemency, the board appeared to be moved by questions Littlejohn’s lawyers raised about whether he or a co-defendant fired the shot that killed Kenneth Meers. Littlejohn’s attorneys also suggested the jury was unclear about whether a sentence of life without parole would guarantee someone would never be released.
His lethal injection came just two days after the execution of Marcellus Williams in Missouri, where advocates insisted Williams was innocent.


Strapped to a gurney and with an IV line in his right arm, Littlejohn looked toward his mother and daughter, who witnessed the execution.
“Mom, you OK?” Littlejohn asked. 
“I’m OK,” his mother, Ceily Mason, responded.
“Everything is going to be OK. I love you,” he said.
Mason sobbed quietly and clutched a cross necklace during the lethal injection, which began shortly after 10 a.m. Littlejohn’s breathing became labored before a doctor declared him unconscious at 10:07 a.m. He was pronounced dead 10 minutes later.
Littlejohn’s spiritual advisor, the Rev. Jeff Hood, was inside the death chamber and prayed over him.
Steven Harpe, the director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, said the lethal injection went without any problems.
If an execution set for Thursday evening in Alabama is carried out, it would mark the first time in decades that five death row inmates were put to death in the U.S. within one week. The five executions would also mark another grim milestone — 1,600 executions since the death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Littlejohn was 20 when prosecutors say he and co-defendant Glenn Bethany robbed the Root-N-Scoot convenience store in south Oklahoma City in June 1992. 
During video testimony to the Pardon and Parole Board in early August, Littlejohn apologized to Meers’ family but denied firing the fatal shot. Littlejohn’s attorneys pointed out that the same prosecutor tried Bethany and Littlejohn in separate trials using a nearly identical theory, even though there was only one shooter and one bullet that killed Meers, 31.
But prosecutors told the board that two teenage store employees who witnessed the robbery both said Littlejohn, not Bethany, fired the fatal shot. Bethany was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
Littlejohn’s attorneys also argued that killings resulting from a robbery are rarely considered death penalty cases and that prosecutors today would not have pursued the ultimate punishment.
“It is evident that Emmanuel would not have been sentenced to death if he’d been tried in 2024 or even 2004,” attorney Caitlin Hoeberlein told the board.
Littlejohn was prosecuted by former Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy, who was known for his zealous pursuit of the death penalty and secured 54 death sentences during more than 20 years in office.
Stitt previously asked one of his appointees to the parole board, Adam Luck, to step down after Luck voted several times to recommend clemency.
The only time Stitt has granted clemency was in 2021, when he commuted Julius Jones’ death sentence to life without parole just hours before Jones was scheduled to receive a lethal injection. Stitt has denied clemency recommendations from the board in three other cases: Bigler Stouffer, James Coddington and Phillip Hancock, all of whom were executed.
A state appellate court on Wednesday denied a last-minute legal challenge from Littlejohn’s attorneys to the constitutionality of the state’s lethal injection method of execution. A similar appeal filed in federal court also was rejected Thursday.",True

WASHINGTON (AP) — Israel warned U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in a call Tuesday that a military operation was going to take place in Lebanon but gave no details, U.S. officials said Thursday. The same day of the call, in an attack widely blamed on Israel, thousands of pagers belonging to Hezbollah militants exploded.
The call was one of four between Austin and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant this week as attacks have spiked between Israel and Hezbollah, fueling worries that they could escalate into a wider regional war. 
The two spoke again later Tuesday, and the U.S. has acknowledged being briefed following the attack. There was another call Wednesday, and they also spoke Sunday, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.
The officials said the U.S. did not get advance warning of the second wave of attacks, with walkie-talkie radios targeted Wednesday. At least 37 people were killed, including two children, and some 3,000 wounded in the two days of explosions.
The officials stressed that the U.S. played no role in the attacks and said they were surprised by the specifics of the operations.
The attacks on electronic devices this week appeared to be the culmination of a monthslong operation by Israel to target as many Hezbollah members as possible all at once — but civilians were also hit.
Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh on Thursday acknowledged the four calls but did not provide timelines of when they happened. She said the U.S. has not made any changes in its force posture in the region as a result of the recent surge in attacks.


During a call Wednesday with Gallant, Austin spoke about regional security developments and reiterated America’s unwavering support for Israel in the face of threats from Iran, Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies in the region, Singh said.
Austin “emphasized the U.S. commitment to deterring regional adversaries, deescalating tensions across the region, and reaffirmed the priority of reaching a cease-fire deal that would bring home hostages held by Hamas,” she said. 
He also pushed for a diplomatic solution that would allow civilians on both sides of Israel’s northern border with Lebanon to return to their homes, Singh said.
Asked about the potential for a U.S. military evacuation of American citizens in Lebanon, Singh said the Pentagon has not gotten a request from the State Department to do that. State did urge U.S. citizens in Lebanon to maintain a low profile and review their security awareness in alerts this week.
State Department and White House officials say there are longstanding contingency plans for the potential evacuation of Americans in Lebanon but they have no information to suggest that those will become operational anytime soon.
“We have evacuation plans available for places all over the world,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday. “But I wouldn’t lead that to believe that we’re in a moment now where we think we need to imminently call for that or act on that right now.”
Other officials said U.S. Navy ships with Marines on board are already well-positioned in the Mediterranean Sea to assist if asked.

Publication date:2024-09-26 23:26:00

MONTREAL (AP) — The Presidents Cup matches were close. The score after the opening session was not.
The Americans clung to a 1-up lead in all five matches Thursday when they delivered shot after shot, putt after putt, until this already lopsided series took a familiar turn.
United States 5, International 0.
The Americans swept the first day of fourballs matches at Royal Montreal behind a feisty Scottie Scheffler, late heroics from Xander Schauffele and plenty of help from the putting-challenged International team.
It was the third time they shut out the Internationals on the first day, and the first time since 2000. The Americans went on to an 11-point victory that year.
“We’re excited with our start — high fives, celebrate — and we’re going to keep the pressure on,” U.S. captain Jim Furyk said.
International captain Mike Weir had a plan for the opening two days and he didn’t see anything on the course to make any changes for the foursomes matches on Friday. Adam Scott has never been on a winning team since his debut in 2003, and he wasn’t about to lose hope.
“The best news is there’s tomorrow for us. It’s not over,” Scott said. “We’re going to have to come out, fight really hard, find that gear, win a session and get going in the right direction. The score line looks rough. But I don’t think there was that much difference in it today.”
Three matches reached the 18th green. One ended on No. 17. The shortest match was Scheffler and Russell Henley getting the last word in a 3-and-2 win over Tom Kim and Sungjae Im.


Scheffler and Henley never trailed in what was the spiciest match of an otherwise flat day, the Canadian crowd mostly silent after Mackenzie Hughes, who sat out the first session, chugged a beer on the opening tee to get them going.
Scheffler and Kim are good friends who play plenty of money games in Dallas. On the par-3 seventh hole, the 22-year-old Kim holed a putt from just inside 30 feet and did a pirouette on the green, screaming, “Let’s Go!”
Scheffler matched the birdie from about the same length, and the world’s No. 1 player turned toward Kim and screamed, “What was that?”
It got testy on the next hole when Kim made another long birdie, celebrated wildly and then he and Im walked over to the ninth tee without even watching Scheffler putt.
“It’s the same thing I would have done at home if he had made a putt ... and he celebrated like that. So it’s all in good fun. We enjoy competing against each other,” Scheffler said. “That’s what it’s like out here. It’s fun to compete and fun to represent our country, and at the end of the match you take your hat off and shake hands.
“We’re friends after, we’re not friends during, I guess.”
The Internationals never looked like they would win the session. They weren’t expecting a shutout, either.
Taylor Pendrith, one of two Canadians in the lineup, made birdie on the 12th as he and Christiaan Bezuidenhout squared their match against Keegan Bradley and Wyndham Clark.
Schauffele and Tony Finau missed 3-foot par putts on the 16th and their opening match against Jason Day and Byeong Hun An was all square.
It could have gone either way. But it only got worse for the Internationals.
Bezuidenhout missed three 7-foot putts in a span of four holes that kept his side from squaring the match. Scott missed a pair of putts from the 12-foot range.
The Americans delivered the goods.
Schauffele atoned for his short miss by hitting his tee shot to 7 feet to a back pin on the par-3 17th for a birdie, and then hit his approach to 3 feet on the 18th to close out the match.
“Tony got the party started on the front nine and he had my back all day,” Schauffele said. “I figured it was my time to have his back.”
Bradley, the Ryder Cup captain for next year who has gone 10 years since his last cup competition, holed a 35-foot putt on the 13th and secured a 1-up win over Scott and Min Woo Lee with a 10-foot putt. Emotions were pouring from him.
“It was 10 years of pent-up energy of not playing these,” Bradley said. “I just had such a blast out there today.”
Collin Morikawa and Sahith Theegala rallied from a 1-down deficit through 11 holes when Morikawa birdied the 12th and 14th holes. Theegala secured it with an approach to just inside 3 feet. He made the putt, the first time all day he retrieved his golf ball from the cup.
In the anchor match, Patrick Cantlay was relentless as ever and Sam Burns made a 10-foot birdie on the 13th hole that put them 2 up, and Corey Conners and Hideki Matsuyama could never cut into the lead.
The Americans also swept the opening session in 1994. This was the eighth time in the last nine Presidents Cups they had a lead after the first day.
Friday has five foursomes matches. Furyk is keeping two teams together, including Scheffler and Henley, with Cantlay and Schauffele looking to build on their foursomes record.
“The last couple road games have been close,” Cantlay said. “I think it’s a huge statement. I think we need to build on that tomorrow.”

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Royals’ late-season losing streak stretched to five on Friday night with a 2-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants, who got three hits from Heliot Ramos.
Kansas City dropped four games behind Baltimore for the first AL wild card spot and saw its lead cut to one game over Minnesota for the second of the three wild cards.
“You’ve got to make your own breaks,” Royals manager Matt Quatraro said. “We had every opportunity to hit a ball in the gap or a line drive through the middle. We’ve got to keep putting ourselves in the opportunities to get guys on base and force the action. Hopefully we break through.”
Mason Black (1-4) pitched shutout ball over a career-high 5 2/3 innings for already eliminated San Francisco, limiting the Royals to four hits. 
“He pitched great,” San Francisco manager Bob Melvin said. “He seems like the last few times he’s been a little bit more comfortable and confident with what he’s doing out there.”
Camilo Doval allowed Garrett Hampson’s sacrifice fly before striking out Tommy Pham with runners on second and third to get his 23rd save in 28 chances.
“That was a little stressful, but he got out of it,” Melvin said.
Hampson came close to a bases-clearing double down the left-field line that would have won the game with one out in the ninth, but the ball was ruled foul. Quatraro asked to challenge the ruling but was denied.


“I was surprised it was called foul,” Quatraro said. “I didn’t have a great angle from where I was sitting, but they called it foul and it’s not reviewable.”
Quatraro felt like the ball was behind third-base umpire John Bacon, but he was told that the replay umpire in New York said it wasn’t.
“I’ve argued that one a million times,” Melvin said. “You can’t review it unless it’s behind him.”
Kansas City went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position and stranded nine runners, including three runners in scoring position in the first two innings.
“You want to score every time you get those opportunities,” Quatraro said. “It just didn’t go our way.”
“We hit the ball hard but didn’t have anything to show for it,” Adam Frazier said. “We just need a timely hit or two. The pitchers kept us in the game.”
Michael Wacha (13-8) gave up two runs on six hits in 5 2/3 innings, dropping to 9-2 in 15 starts since June 22.
“I feel like they made me work, especially in the first,” Wacha said. “I feel like I was able to settle in there, but the sixth was frustrating.”
Mike Yastrzemski led off the first with a bloop single, advanced to second on a walk and to third on a flyout, then scored on Ramos’ infield hit.
Ramos hit a two-out double to the wall in right-center in the sixth and scored on Patrick Bailey’s single for a 2-0 lead.
Giants right-hander Jordan Hicks was placed on the 15-day injured list retroactive to Tuesday with right-shoulder inflammation and right-hander Austin Warren was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento.
In a game moved up to 4:10 p.m. CDT because of a forecast of bad weather, San Francisco RHP Landen Roupp (0-1, 3.02 ERA) is to start Saturday against Kansas CIty RHP Brady Singer (9-11, 3.53 ERA).

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — There was a sense of relief in a somewhat subdued Dallas Cowboys locker room after a hard-fought victory over the New York Giants. There was little celebration.
What was important Thursday night were the numbers on the scoreboard at MetLife Stadium. Dallas Cowboys 20, New York Giants 15.
The two-game losing streak was over and those who have been criticizing Dallas (2-2) and coach Mike McCarthy and predicting a disappointing season had been quieted for one night. The Cowboys were back to being the Cowboys, a good offense and a solid defense.
Dak Prescott threw one of his two touchdown passes to CeeDee Lamb and the Cowboys beat the Giants for the seventh straight time and 14th in 15 games.
“We got to change the narrative. That’s what this game did, especially over a long weekend,” said Prescott, who completed 22 of 27 for 221 yards. “It puts us at 2-and-2. It allows us a couple of days to get our mind right, to get our body right.”
Prescott hit running back Rico Dowdle on a 15-yard screen pass for a touchdown to put Dallas ahead in the first quarter. He then found Lamb for a 55-yard catch-and-run TD on a play that ended with the receiver being called for taunting.
“I lost my first two games to them,” said Prescott, who has won his last 13 starts against New York. “It could have been a remarkable rookie year had that not happened. It’s a good matchup for us. The offensive line always sets the tone. I love playing here in New York. Cowboy fans travel well.”


Lamb slipped past two defenders and trotted into the end zone. He then fired the ball in their direction and flexed his muscles, drawing an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty.

“I think it was the only 1-on-1 I got all game and we exploited it,” said Lamb, who hadh seven catches for 98 yards. He still has not had a 100-yard game this season. 
Brandon Aubrey kicked field goals of 60 and 40 yards for Dallas, which came into the game with major concerns after being thoroughly beaten at home by New Orleans and Baltimore. A new issue for the Cowboys is an apparent leg injury to star pass rusher Micah Parsons, who was carted off the field in the fourth quarter. Parsons said he is getting X-rays on Friday.
Greg Joseph made field goals of 52, 41, 38, 22 and 42 for the Giants (1-3), who controlled the ball for 35:37 but failed to score a touchdown at home for the second straight game. They had two field goals in a 28-6 loss to Minnesota in their opener.
What hurt New York was its inability to run against the league’s worst rush defense. Dallas been giving up an average of 185.7 yards, but it held the Giants to 26 yards on 24 carries, a 1.1-yard average.
“I would say we’ve got to do a better job in the run game, and that starts with me,” coach Brian Daboll said. “But we tried a variety of things, we couldn’t really get much going.” 
Daniel Jones’ arm kept this one close. He completed 29 of 40 passes for 281 yards, finding sensational rookie Malik Nabers 12 times for 115 yards and Wan’Dale Robinson 11 times for 71 yards. But the one thing he could not find was the end zone.
“We don’t feel good about losing,” said Jones, who has has three straight solid performance. “We didn’t didn’t do enough to win. We’re frustrated. We’re not discouraged. I think we’re still confident in our team and what we can do well, but we don’t feel good about this.”
Nabers left late in the game with a concussion. Jones threw an interception on the Giants’ final series after Aubrey missed a 51-yard field goal try — his first career miss from over 50 yards — to give New York one slim last shot.
If there was a bright spot for the Giants, they were at least competitive against a bitter rival. They lost last year’s two games by an 89-17 margin.
The Cowboys got just what they wanted on Thursday night.
“You lose two in a row, you go through a phase where everybody is kind of uptight,” Lamb said. “Was good for us to come out 1-and-0 this week. It’s one we needed. It’s a division game. It put us in the right place.”
Cowboys: DE DeMarcus Lawrence, who had a sack in the first half to run his career total to 61 1/2, left in the second half with a foot injury. ... Rookie starting CB Caelen Carson and backup S Markquese Bell (ankle) were inactive after being listed as doubtful. Andrew Booth started for Carson and was relieved by Amani Oruwariye at the start of the second half. 
Giants: Nabers, the No. 6 overall draft pick and a breakout star, suffered the concussion on New York’s next-to-last series.
Cowboys: At Pittsburgh for a Sunday night game on Oct. 6, the second of their five scheduled prime-time appearances.

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Undrafted second-year tackle Alex Palczewski is preparing for his first NFL start after the Denver Broncos placed starting right tackle Mike McGlinchey on injured reserve Monday with a knee injury.
The Broncos (0-2) visit three-time defending NFC South champion Tampa Bay this weekend with the Buccaneers (2-0) off to another strong start.
McGlinchey sprained his left MCL in the closing minutes of the Broncos’ 13-6 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday and Palczewski played the last two snaps.
Palczewski, who started 65 games over six seasons at the University of Illinois, was one of four undrafted free agents who made the Broncos’ 53-man roster coming out of training camp last year but a hand injury sent him to IR for the bulk of his rookie season.
He spent the offseason working out with McGlinchey in Denver.
“Mike McGlinchey has helped me tenfold since I’ve gotten here to improve,” Palczewski said Wednesday. “He’s helping me figure out that stuff and just getting to pick his brain and how he thinks and how he goes about his process, it’s been an awesome chance to have.”
McGlinchey will miss at least four games. The earliest he can return is Week 7 at New Orleans.
“Yeah, that’s going to affect us,” rookie quarterback Bo Nix said. “But it’s next man up and we feel really strong about ‘Palcho’ and what he’ll do for us.”
During training camp, coach Sean Payton praised Palczewski’s smarts and efficiency, saying, “There are maybe some things athletically he’s not as gifted at, yet when the pads come on and you get into these live reps or somewhat live reps, you check the box and say, ‘He does his job.’”


To take McGlinchey’s roster spot, the Broncos promoted outside linebacker and ex-UFL star Dondrea Tillman from their practice squad. They also signed former Chargers pass rusher Andrew Farmer to their practice squad.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer was scratched from his scheduled start for the Texas Rangers on Saturday night, then put on the 15-day injured list with a left hamstring strain that means his season is over. 
Dane Dunning replaced Scherzer as the starter for the middle game of a series against the AL wild card-chasing Seattle Mariners. The Rangers recalled right-hander Gerson Garabito from Triple-A Round Rock.
“Max woke up today, said his hamstring was tight, tight the point where he said he couldn’t go,” manager Bruce Bochy said. “Felt it yesterday running some sprints. Just didn’t clear up like he was hoping.”
Scherzer (2-4, 3.95 ERA) has made only one start for the Rangers since July 30. The 40-year-old right-hander was activated from the injured list last Saturday after missing 40 games with right shoulder fatigue and an arm nerve issue in his arm. He struck out six while allowing one run and four hits over four innings.
“He’s been trying hard to get back out there pitching,” Bochy said. “You want him out there. And we were hoping to see him out there on a consistent basis. We had some things that we were trying to figure out with the arm. Now it’s the hamstring. It’s been a tough year for him.”
Scherzer is in the final season of his contract. The Rangers acquired him from the New York Mets in a deadline trade last summer after the pitcher agreed to opt in on that final year for this season at $43.3 million — with New York paying $30.83 million. 


After offseason back surgery, Scherzer dealt with the nerve issue during his rehab and didn’t make his season debut until June 23. His nine starts this season are his fewest since seven as a rookie for Arizona in 2008.
His 3,407 career strikeouts are 11th on baseball’s all-time list, and second among active pitchers behind fellow three-time Cy Young winner Justin Verlander. Scherzer’s 216 career wins are also second to his former teammate for active pitchers.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year high, with consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses. 
On Wednesday, the Fed announced that it reduced its key rate by an unusually large half-percentage point, to between 4.75 and 5 percent, the first rate cut in more than four years.
The central bank is acting because, after imposing 11 rate hikes dating back to March 2022, it feels confident that inflation is finally mild enough that it can begin to ease the cost of borrowing. At the same time, the Fed has grown more concerned about the health of the job market. Lower rates would help support the pace of hiring and keep unemployment down.
“Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” the Fed said in a statement. “Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made further progress.”
More Fed rate cuts are expected in the coming months, with the steepness of the reductions dependent on the direction of inflation and job growth.
“We know that it is time to recalibrate our (interest rate) policy to something that’s more appropriate given the progress on inflation,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference. “The labor market is actually in solid condition and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.”


“We don’t think we’re behind — we think this is timely,” he added. “But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind.”
Although taking action now to try to capitalize on lower rates, like shifting money out of a certificate of deposit or refinancing a mortgage, “might be warranted for some, you shouldn’t feel obligated to completely change up your financial strategy just because rates move lower,” said Jacob Channel, a senior economist at LendingTree.
“Act cautiously and responsibly,” Channel said, “and don’t make any rash decisions based on a single Fed meeting or economic report.”
Eventually, yields for savers will decline as the Fed lowers its benchmark rate. 
“As attractive as yields on savings instruments have recently been, it’s wise not to hold too much in cash because these are short-term instruments and their yields are ephemeral,” said Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar. “The really great yields that we’ve had recently may go lower.”
If you don’t have a need for cash right away, you can continue to lock in what are “still pretty decent yields on offer,” she said. In that case, “longer-term certificates of deposit might make sense.”
“Lower interest rates make it harder to maximize savings and preserve the capital built while interest rates have been higher,” said Matt Brannon, a personal finance expert at MarketWatch guides. “An easy short-term move to protect your savings is to shift your funds into a high-yield savings account, which offers higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts... These types of savings accounts will still help you to preserve capital due to comparatively higher interest rates.”
“While lower rates are certainly a good thing for those struggling with debt, the truth is that this one rate cut isn’t really going to make much of a difference for most people,” said Matt Schulz, a credit analyst at LendingTree.
That said, the Fed’s declining benchmark rate will eventually mean better rates for borrowers, many of whom are facing some of the highest credit card interest rates in decades. The average interest rate is 23.18% for new offers and 21.51% for existing accounts, according to WalletHub’s August Credit Card Landscape Report.
Still, “the best thing people can do to lower interest rates is to take matters into their own hands,” Schulz said. “Consolidating your debts with a 0% balance transfer credit card or a low-interest personal loan can have a far bigger impact on your debt load than most anything the Fed will do.”
The Fed’s benchmark rate doesn’t directly set or correspond to mortgage rates. But it does have a major indirect influence, and the two “tend to move in the same direction,” said LendingTree’s Channel.
To wit, mortgage rates have already declined ahead of the Fed’s predicted cut. 
“It goes to show that even when the Fed isn’t doing anything and just holding steady, mortgage rates can still move,” he said.
Channel said that the majority of Americans have mortgages at 5%, so rates may have to fall further than their current average of 6.46% before many people consider refinancing. 
“With auto loans, it’s good news that rates will be falling, but it doesn’t change the basic blocking and tackling of things, which is that it’s still really important to shop around and not just accept the rate that a car dealer would offer you at the dealership,” said Greg McBride, an analyst at Bankrate. “It’s also really important to save what you can and be able to try to put as much down on that vehicle as you can.”
McBride predicts that the rate cuts and the avoidance of a recession will lead to lower auto loan rates, at least for borrowers with strong credit profiles. For those with lower credit profiles, double digit rates will likely persist for the remainder of the year. 
Robert Frick, corporate economist for Navy Federal Credit Union, said that while he thinks a rate cut will work its way into auto loans, it probably won’t happen immediately and people with higher credit scores will likely benefit first.
Loans for new vehicles right now are averaging 7.1%, with used vehicle loans at a much higher 11.3%, according to Edmunds.com.
Those rates, coupled with still-high prices, have sent many possible buyers to the sidelines waiting for rates to drop. Partly as a result, U.S. new vehicle sales rose only a sluggish 2.4% through June.
High prices and rates have also led to more delinquent payments and defaults on auto loans, especially among people with lower credit scores. As a result, Frick said, many lenders will probably try to keep rates high to cover potential losses. 
“Rates will be coming down, but we shouldn’t expect them to come down quickly overall,” he said.
Frick suggests waiting for additional Fed rate cuts to come through if possible, especially if you’re buying a used vehicle.
Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research for Global Data, said he doubts that modest rate cuts by the Fed will be enough to draw many buyers off the sidelines, unless automakers offer their own low-interest loans and other discounts.
“I think it’s going to take a couple more cuts before we get any substantial relief for those consumers,” he said.
Consumer prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier, down from 2.9% in July — the fifth straight annual drop and the smallest since February 2021. 
Hiring picked up a bit in August, and the unemployment rate dipped for the first time since March. Employers added 142,000 jobs, up from 89,000 in July. The unemployment rate declined to 4.2% from 4.3%, which had been the highest level in nearly three years. 
Those signs indicate that the job market, though cooling, remains sturdy.
The rate at which the Fed continues to cut rates after September will depend in part on what happens next with inflation and the job market, in the coming weeks and months.

BEIRUT (AP) — Israel launched a rare airstrike that killed a senior Hezbollah military official in a densely populated southern Beirut neighborhood on Friday. It was the deadliest such strike on Lebanon’s capital in decades, with Lebanese authorities reporting at least 14 people killed and dozens more wounded in the attack. 
The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the strike on Beirut’s southern Dahiya district killed Ibrahim Akil, a commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, as well as 10 other Hezbollah operatives.
“We will continue pursuing our enemies in order to defend our citizens, even in Dahiya, in Beirut,” said Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, describing the Israeli strike that targeted Akil as part of “a new phase of war.”
Several hours later, Hezbollah confirmed Akil’s death. In a statement, the Lebanese militant group described Akil as “a great jihadist leader” and said he had “joined the procession of his brothers, the great martyr leaders, after a blessed life full of jihad, work, wounds, sacrifices, dangers, challenges, achievements, and victories.”
Akil served on Hezbollah’s highest military body, the Jihad Council. He was sanctioned by the United States for his alleged involvement in the 1983 bombing that killed more than 300 people at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the U.S. Marine Corps barracks.
Last year, the U.S. State Department posted a $7 million reward for information leading to his identification, location, arrest or conviction, citing his role in the embassy bombing and in the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s.


The strike came as a new cycle of escalation between the enemies raised fears of a full-out war erupting in the Middle East. 
Hours before the Israeli strike, Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with 140 rockets as the region awaited the revenge promised by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah over this week’s mass explosions of pagers belonging to members of the Shiite militant group.


The Israeli military did not provide the identities of the other Hezbollah commanders allegedly killed in its strike on the crowded neighborhood just kilometers from downtown Beirut. 
Lebanon’s Health Ministry said at least 14 people were killed and 66 others were wounded in the attack, which leveled the apartment building where the Israeli army claimed Akil had been meeting with other militants in the basement. Nine of the wounded were in serious condition, the ministry added.
Local networks in Lebanon broadcast footage showing first responders sifting through the rubble of a collapsed high-rise in the Jamous area in the heart of Dahiya, where Hezbollah conducts many of its political and security operations. 
The rescue operation continued into the late hours of Friday, hours after the attack, as first responders wrestled to remove the rubble to reach the basement of the building where apparently many of the bodies were located.
Friday’s airstrike — the deadliest such attack on a neighborhood of Beirut since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bloody, monthlong war in 2006 — hit during rush hour, as people were leaving work and children heading home from school.
At Beirut’s St. Therese Hospital near the scene of the airstrike, crowds flocked to donate blood for those wounded in the attack.
“We are all together in this situation, so it’s my obligation,” said Hussein Harake, who lined up to donate blood.
From Israel, Gallant said he briefed senior military officials on the strike and vowed Israel would press on against Hezbollah “until we achieve our goal, ensuring the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes.”
The strike came after Hezbollah launched one of its most intense bombardments of northern Israel in nearly a year of fighting, largely targeting Israeli military sites. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the Katyusha rockets. The few that got through sparked small fires but caused little damage and no Israeli casualties.
Hezbollah described its latest wave of rocket salvos as a response to past Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon — not as revenge for the mass explosions of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies on Tuesday and Wednesday that killed at least 37 people - including two children - and wounded 2,900 others in attacks widely attributed to Israel.
Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in this week’s sophisticated attacks, which signaled a major escalation in the past 11 months of simmering conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border. 
Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. But previous cross-border attacks have largely struck areas in northern Israel that had been evacuated and less-populated parts of southern Lebanon.
The last time Israel hit Beirut was in a July airstrike that killed senior Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur.
“The attack in Lebanon is to protect Israel,” Hagari said at a news conference following Friday’s strike, describing both Shukr and Akil as the two military officials closest to Hezbollah leader Nasrallah.
Hagari also accused Akil of plotting a series of attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians dating back decades, including a never-realized plan to invade northern Israel in a similar way to the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks.
After Friday’s Israeli airstrike, Hezbollah announced attacks on northern Israel, two of which it said targeted an intelligence base from where it claimed Israel directed assassinations. 
Israel remains on edge, with Nasrallah vowing Thursday to keep up strikes on Israel despite the humiliating “blow” he said Hezbollah suffered in the sabotage of its communication devices.
“We are in a tense period,” Hagari told reporters Friday. “We are prepared on high alert both offensively and defensively.”
In recent days, Israel has sent a powerful fighting force to the northern border, designated as an official war goal the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in northern Israel and ordered citizens near Israel’s border with Lebanon to stay close to bomb shelters. Hezbollah has maintained that it will only halt its fire when there is a cease-fire in Gaza.
Hamas, which continues to fight Israel in Gaza, condemned the Israeli strike targeting Akil as a “new crime” and “violation of Lebanese sovereignty.”
Even as the world’s attention turns to the surge in Israel-Hezbollah tensions, Palestinian casualties in the besieged Gaza Strip continued to mount.
Palestinian health authorities early Friday reported that 15 people, including children, were killed in Israeli strikes that targeted a family home and a group of people on the street in Gaza City. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has already killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza-based Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between fighters and civilians.
In response to a request for comment on the latest Gaza strikes, the Israeli military insisted on Friday that it took “feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm” and accused Hamas of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas.
Israel’s bombardment and invasion of the Gaza Strip — launched in response to Hamas killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage in southern Israel on Oct. 7 — has wreaked vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million.

ATLANTA (AP) — Mookie Betts had a tiebreaking RBI single with two outs in a seven-run ninth inning and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves 9-2 on Sunday night.
The loss dropped the Braves into a tie with the Mets for the third wild-card spot in the National League with 13 games to play.
The Dodgers hold a two-game lead on the Brewers in their pursuit of the National League’s No. 2 seed and first-round bye in the playoffs. They lead the Padres by four games in the N.L. West.
“I don’t want to say it was the biggest win of the year, but it felt big considering what we’ve been going through,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, whose team had lost six of nine entering Sunday.
Shohei Ohtani was 2 for 4 with two doubles, an RBI and a run scored, but he did not homer or steal a base in his pursuit of MLB’s first 50-50 season. He has 47 home runs and 48 stolen bases.
Teoscar Hernández, Tommy Edman and Max Muncy hit consecutive home runs during the ninth-inning outburst, which started against Braves closer Raisel Iglesias (5-2). He had not allowed an earned run in 35 1/3 innings entering the game, but was charged with the first five runs of the inning — which all came with two outs.
The Braves decided to intentionally walk Ohtani with two outs in the ninth and a runner on third with the score 2-2, leaving the game in Betts’ hands.
“I wouldn’t pitch to him, either,” Betts said. “Fortunately, i was able to come through.”


Roberts said there are probably two players he would walk in order to face Betts.
“One plays in New York,” he said, referring to Aaron Judge. “And the other is in our clubhouse.” 
Freddie Freeman followed Betts’ go-ahead hit with a two-run single before the home runs. 
Dodgers reliever Michael Kopech (6-8) earned the win after escaping a two-on, no-out jam in the eighth inning by getting Travis d’Arnaud to fly out and striking out Orlando Arcia and Jarred Kelenic.
Braves starter Charlie Morton went six innings, surrendering one run on three hits and two walks. He struck out six.
Matt Olson and d’Arnaud picked up the RBIs for the Braves in the third inning.
Dodgers starter Walker Buehler lasted six innings despite having 70 pitches after three. He gave up two runs, one earned on three hits and five walks. He had five strikeouts.
“The third time through (the lineup) in the last three innings, I got a couple first-pitch outs and early outs and some three-pitch punchouts,” Buehler said. “I kind of got rolling and felt good about it.”
Ohtani tied the score 2-2 in the seventh with a two-out RBI double to right field. Betts flew out to center field to end the threat.
Ohtani also doubled home a run for the Dodgers in the fifth inning to cut the Braves’ lead to 2-1. With two outs, he lined a pitch to right field that scored Muncy. It was Ohtani’s first hit in eight at-bats in the series.
Dodgers: Catcher Austin Barnes left the game in the fourth inning with a left big toe contusion. Will Smith replaced him. Roberts said Barnes will likely go on the injured list and Hunter Feduccia would be recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City.
The Braves and Dodgers will wrap up their four-game series in Atlanta with Los Angeles RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto (6-2, 2.88) facing Atlanta LHP Max Fried (9-9, 3.46).

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray was asked about his thoughts during that spectacular play in the first half. You know, the one where he had a Houdini-like scramble to avoid trouble before figuring out a way to pick up a big gain.
Murray thought for a moment, then a little grin crossed his face.
Which one?
There were plenty of highlights to choose from in a spectacular day for the Cardinals’ offense. Murray threw for 266 yards and three touchdowns, rookie receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. caught his first two NFL touchdown passes and the Cardinals rolled past the Los Angeles Rams 41-10 on Sunday.
“He was lights out,” Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said of Murray. “He’s a premium player for a reason. You take him against anybody. That’s how I feel and that’s what he did today.”
The Cardinals’ offense — highlighted by the Murray-to-Harrison combo — dazzled on the way to a 24-3 halftime lead.
Murray found Harrison for a 23-yard touchdown on the first drive, a 60-yard touchdown on the second drive and then somehow evaded three Rams defenders before hitting tight end Elijah Higgins on an 18-yard touchdown on the third drive for a 21-0 advantage.
Arizona (1-1) snapped a nine-game losing streak to the Rams (0-2) at State Farm Stadium, and won for just the third time in 16 tries in the NFC West rivalry.
James Conner ran for a five-yard score on the first drive of the third quarter, high-stepping into the end zone for a 31-3 lead. Conner finished with 122 yards rushing and the 29-year-old passed 5,000 yards on the ground for his career. Murray completed 17 of 21 passes and also ran for 59 yards. 


Harrison had 130 yards receiving.

The rookie was much more productive than in his debut last week, when he caught just one pass for 4 yards in a loss to the Bills.
“I never lacked confidence in myself or the rest of the team,” Harrison said. “I’ll continue to get better each week and continue to grow.”
Dennis Gardeck had three sacks. Matt Prater booted two field goals, including one from 57 yards that made it 34-3.
While Arizona’s offense was thriving, Los Angeles was sputtering. Matthew Stafford was sacked three times in the first half and the Rams couldn’t find the end zone. On the final play of the second quarter, coach Sean McVay elected to go for a touchdown from the 4-yard line instead of kicking a field goal, but Stafford’s pass sailed well over Tyler Johnson’s head and out the back of the end zone.
“Disappointing day,” Stafford said. “Not the way we wanted to come out here and play. No question about that. But it’s not going to define us as a team or our season. We’ll go back to work.”
To make matters worse, star receiver Cooper Kupp left in the second quarter with an ankle injury and didn’t return. The Rams have had a rough run of injuries through the first two weeks, putting three key players on injured reserve this week. McVay said postgame he wasn’t sure about the extent of Kupp’s injury.
Stafford finished 19 of 27 passing for 216 yards. 
“There’s not anything positive I can take from today,” McVay said. “Anytime something like this occurs you’ve got to look inward first and foremost. Didn’t do nearly a good enough job. There are so many things we have to go back and look at. It was an incredibly humbling three-hour window.”
Harrison’s first NFL touchdown catch wasn’t easy. The rookie receiver made a tough snag in the back of the end zone, getting both feet down and hanging on to the football as he fell to the ground.
The rookie — who was the No. 4 overall pick out of Ohio State — was back at it again on the next drive. Murray rolled out to his right before hitting the wide open receiver and the Cardinals had a 14-0 lead barely six minutes into the game. Harrison became just the 13th receiver since 1991 to have at least 130 yards receiving in the first quarter.
“I’ve played for a long time — you want to get your guys the ball early so they feel like in the game,” Murray said. “Get them going. Get their juices flowing. I thought we did a good job of that today.”
The Cardinals went up 21-0 early in the second quarter after Murray made three defenders miss, weaving through traffic before firing to Higgins, who was streaking across the back of the end zone and made a sliding catch.

HOUSTON (AP) — The Houston Texans hadn’t scored in the second half and had punted on five straight possessions Sunday when they got one last chance to avoid being upset by the Jacksonville Jaguars.
C.J. Stroud connected with an unlikely option to make sure the Texans came out on top.
Stroud threw for 345 yards and two touchdowns, capped by a 1-yard pass to third-string running back Dare Ogunbowale with 18 seconds left, to give the Texans the 24-20 victory.
Thrust into action with starter Joe Mixon and backup Dameon Pierce out with injuries, Ogunbowale scored a TD for the first time since 2022. 
“It’s obviously always good to get a win, but when you can help your team win it’s special,” he said. 
Houston forced a three-and-out to get the ball back with less than three minutes to go.
Stroud then led a nine-play, 69-yard drive to give the Texans (3-1) their first points of the second half and survive a scare by the winless Jaguars (0-4).
“We were just locked in,” Stroud said. “Defense gave us another shot, and that’s all we needed.”
The Texans bounced back from a 34-7 rout at Minnesota to get the victory despite fumbling a punt return early and committing 12 penalties to give them 35 combined in their past three games.
Nico Collins helped Houston to the win with a career-high 12 receptions for 151 yards and a TD for his third 100-yard game this season. He has 489 yards receiving this season to become the first Texans to surpass 450 yards receiving in the first four games. 


“I feel like there’s always room for improvement on your game,” he said. “My mindset, man, don’t get too comfortable. Continue to build, continue to take care of my body, continue to be available for the team and ... all the pieces will fall into place.”

Trevor Lawrence threw for 169 yards and two touchdowns as his streak of consecutive starts without a win stretched to nine games.
The Jaguars fell to 0-4 for the first time since opening the 2021 season with five straight losses.
Coach Doug Pederson seemed caught off-guard when he was asked if he’s worried about his job status after the dismal start. 
“My status? I mean, no,” he said. “That’s kind of a strange question, but OK.”
After getting blown out by the Bills on Monday, they had plenty of chances in this one. They led through much of the second half after a touchdown reception by Christian Kirk with about six minutes left in the third.
They had a chance to pad the lead after that when a 58-yard run by Tank Bigsby got them to the Houston 4. Two runs by Bigsby moved them to the 2 before an incomplete pass by Lawrence.
Jacksonville went for it, but Lawrence was stopped for no gain on the first play of the fourth quarter.
“We had a lot of opportunities, run game and throwing the ball down the field,” Lawrence said. “Didn’t capitalize on all of them unfortunately. That’s why we’re here now and didn’t win the game in my opinion is because we didn’t take advantage of some of those opportunities.” 
Ogunbowale grabbed a short pass and evaded three defenders for a 31-yard gain on third-and-18 on Houston’s next drive. 
But the Texans couldn’t do anything after that. They had a run for no gain, a holding penalty on left tackle Laremy Tunsil and an incomplete pass before Stroud was sacked to force a punt.
Derek Stingley knocked down Lawrence’s pass to force a punt with about six minutes left.
The Texans couldn’t get anything going on their next drive that ended with a holding penalty on Tunsil followed by two incomplete passes.
Kirk put the Jaguars up 20-17 with an 8-yard TD grab with about six minutes left in the third quarter. Brian Thomas powered that drive with a 32-yard reception and a 13-yard run.
The Texans forced a punt on Jacksonville’s opening drive, but Steven Sims fumbled it, and it was recovered by Daniel Thomas at the 2. Lawrence connected with Brian Thomas Jr. on the next play to give the Jaguars an early lead.
Houston tied it when Stefon Diggs scored his first career rushing touchdown on a 6-yard run with about 7½ minutes left in the opening quarter.
The Jaguars were up 10-7 after a field goal before a 3-yard touchdown reception by Collins put Houston on top 14-10.
Jacksonville added a 52-yard field goal with about four minutes left in the second quarter to cut the lead to 14-13.

OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Air Canada and the union representing its pilots have come to terms on a labor agreement that is likely to prevent a shutdown of Canada’s largest airline.
Talks betwen the company and the Air Line Pilots Association produced a tentative, four-year collective agreement, the airline announced in a statement early Sunday.
The prospective deal recognizes the contributions of the pilots flying for Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge while setting a new framework for company growth. The terms will remain confidential until ratification by union members and approval by the airline’s board of directors over the next month, the airline said.
The pilots association said its Air Canada Master Executive Council voted to approve the tentative agreement on behalf of more than 5,400 Air Canada pilots. After review and ratification by a majority of members, the deal is expected to generate an additional $1.9 billion for the pilots over the period of the agreement, the union said in a statement.
“While it has been an exceptionally long road to this agreement, the consistent engagement and unified determination of our pilots have been the catalyst for achieving this contract,” Charlene Hudy, the executive council’s chair, said in the statement. “After several consecutive weeks of intense round-the-clock negotiations, progress was made on several key issues including compensation, retirement, and work rules.”
Federal Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon confirmed the agreement on Sunday and lauded the company and the union.


“Thanks to the hard work of the parties and federal mediators, disruptions have been prevented for Canadians,” MacKinnon said in a statement. “Negotiated agreements are always the best way forward and yield positive results for companies and workers.”
The airline and its pilots have been in contract talks for more than a year. The pilots have sought wages competitive with their U.S. counterparts, but Air Canada continues to post record profits while expecting pilots to accept below-market compensation, the union said
The two sides could have issued a 72-hour notice of a strike or lockout beginning Sunday. The airline said the notice would have triggered its three-day wind down plan and started the clock on a full work stoppage as soon as Sept. 18.
Air Canada spokesman Christophe Hennebelle previously said the airline was committed to negotiations, but faced union wage demands that the company could not meet.
The airline was not seeking federal intervention, but cautioned the government should be prepared to help avoid major disruptions from the possible shutdown of an airline carrying more than 110,000 passengers daily, Hennebelle said.
Business leaders had urged the federal government to intervene in the talks earlier in the week, but MacKinnon said there was no reason the sides should not have been able to reach a collective agreement.
In August, the Canadian government asked the country’s industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order to end a railway shutdown.
Leaders of numerous business groups including the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of Canada convened in Ottawa on Thursday to call for action, including binding arbitration, to avoid the widespread economic disruptions of an airline shutdown.
NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Thursday his party would not support efforts to force pilots back to work.

NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) — Hezbollah fired over 100 rockets early Sunday across northern Israel, with some landing near the city of Haifa, as Israel launched hundreds of strikes on Lebanon. A Hezbollah leader declared an “open-ended battle” was underway as both sides appeared to be spiraling closer toward all-out war.

The overnight rocket barrage was in response to Israeli attacks in Lebanon that have killed dozens, including a veteran Hezbollah commander, and an unprecedented attack targeting the group’s communications devices. Air raid sirens across northern Israel sent hundreds of thousands of people scrambling into shelters.

One struck near a residential building in Kiryat Bialik, a city near Haifa, wounding at least three people and setting buildings and cars ablaze. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue service said four people were wounded.

Avi Vazana raced to a shelter with his wife and 9-month-old baby before he heard the rocket hitting. Then he went back outside to see if anyone was hurt. 

“I ran without shoes, without a shirt, only with pants. I ran to this house when everything was still on fire to try to find if there are other people,” he said.

Lebanon’s Health Ministry said three people were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes near the border, without saying whether they were civilians or combatants.



The rocket attacks followed an Israeli airstrike Friday in Beirut that killed at least 45 people, including Ibrahim Akil, one of Hezbollah’s top leaders, several other fighters, and women and children.

Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies to explode just days earlier. But it faces a difficult balance of stretching the rules of engagement by hitting deeper into Israel, while at the same time trying to avoid large-scale attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure that could trigger a full-scale war that it would rather not start and take the blame for.

Hezbollah’s deputy leader Naim Kassem said Sunday’s rocket attack was just the beginning of what’s now an ″open-ended battle” with Israel.

“We admit that we are pained. We are humans. But as we are pained — you will also be pained,” Kassem said at Akil’s funeral. He vowed Hezbollah will continue military operations against Israel in support of Gaza but also warned of unexpected attacks “from outside the box,” pointing to rockets fired deeper into Israel.

Late Sunday night, Hezbollah announced a series of strikes on military sites in northern Israel with missiles and artillery shelling. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties or damages.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would take whatever action was necessary to restore security in the north and allow people to return to their homes.

“No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can’t accept it either,” he said.

Other funerals were held Sunday for those killed in the airstrike. Seven people, including three women and two children, were buried in the southern Lebanese town of Mays al-Jabal, where Christian Lebanese lawmaker Melhem Khalaf said Israel “relies on the laws of the jungle instead international conventions, especially with protecting civilians.”

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told ABC’s “This Week” that the U.S. has been “involved in extensive and quite assertive diplomacy.” He added: “We want to make sure that we can continue to do everything we can to try to prevent this from becoming an all-out war there with Hezbollah across that Lebanese border.”





The Israeli military said it struck about 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers, across southern Lebanon in the past 24 hours, thwarting an even larger attack.

“Hundreds of thousands of civilians have come under fire across a lot of northern Israel,” said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. “Today we saw fire that was deeper into Israel than before.”

The military also said it intercepted multiple aerial devices fired from the direction of Iraq, after Iran-backed militant groups there claimed to have launched a drone attack on Israel.

School was canceled across northern Israel, and the Health Ministry said all hospitals in the north would move operations to protected areas in the medical centers. 

Separately, Israeli forces raided the West Bank bureau of Al Jazeera, which it had banned earlier this year, accusing it of serving as a mouthpiece for militant groups, allegations denied by the pan-Arab broadcaster.



Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. The low-level fighting has killed dozens in Israel, hundreds in Lebanon, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier.

Until recently, neither side was believed to be seeking an all-out war, and Hezbollah has so far stopped short of targeting Tel Aviv or major civilian infrastructure. But in recent weeks, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon. Hezbollah has said it would only halt its attacks if the war in Gaza ends, as a cease-fire there appears increasingly elusive.

The war in Gaza began with Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. They are still holding about 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It doesn’t say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up more than half of the dead.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. envoy for Lebanon, said on X.

Families of Israeli hostages and residents of Gaza expressed fears the fighting in Lebanon will divert international attention from their own plights.

“I’m incredibly concerned with the increased tensions with Hezbollah because, my biggest concern is that, all the public’s attention and the world’s attention” would be distracted, said Udi Goren, a relative of Tal Haimi, an Israeli who was killed Oct. 7 and whose body was taken into Gaza.

Enas Kollab, a Palestinian displaced from Gaza, voiced similar fears. “We are afraid that the situation in Lebanon will affect us -- that all attention will turn to Lebanon and we will become forgotten,” she said.



Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles — a new weapon the group hadn’t used before — at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, “in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.”

In July, the group released what it said was video it had taken of the base with surveillance drones.

Hezbollah also said it had targeted facilities of the Rafael defense firm, headquartered in Haifa, calling it retaliation for the wireless devices attack. It didn’t provide evidence, and the Israeli military declined to comment.

Hezbollah vowed to retaliate for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people — including two children — and wounding about 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which hasn’t confirmed or denied responsibility.

An Israeli airstrike Friday took down an eight-story building in a densely populated Beirut suburb as Hezbollah members met in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Akil, who commanded the group’s special forces unit.


Kareem Chehayeb reported from Beirut. Moshe Edri in Kiryat Bialik; Wafaa Shurafa in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip; and Shlomo Mor in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed.

NEW YORK (AP) — Yankees star Aaron Judge was scratched from the starting lineup from Sunday’s rain-delayed regular-season finale against Pittsburgh, and first baseman Ben Rice was recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre a day after Anthony Rizzo got hurt.
Judge was in the original starting lineup playing center field but was replaced by Trent Grisham about the time New York said the game would not start as scheduled at 3:05 p.m. The field was soggy for about the first five innings of New York’s 6-4 win, which began after a 91-minute delay.
Judge got his third game off Friday, a day after the AL East title was clinched, then returned Saturday and went 0 for 5, tying his career high with five strikeouts. He is hitting .322 and leads the major leagues with 58 homers and 144 RBIs.
“Once I went out there, it was wet and then we went in the delay, ‘I just said, I don’t want you out there,’” manager Aaron Boone said.
Rizzo fractured the fourth and fifth fingers of his right hand when hit by a pitch from Pittsburgh’s Ryan Borucki in the seventh inning of Saturday’s 9-4 loss to the Pirates. It was the 222nd time Rizzo was hit by a pitch.
New York has not placed Rizzo on the injured list because he said he was feeling much better than when he fractured his right forearm in a collision at first base with Boston reliever Brennan Bernadino on June 16.
“Like my elbow, I’ve never gone through this before so I’m going off my elbow,” Rizzo said. “I feel 10 times better than my elbow felt. It felt a lot better than expected this morning and throughout the day.”


Rizzo also said he will undergo treatment for the few next days before seeing if he can play when the Yankees work out Friday ahead of the division series opener against Baltimore or Kansas City on Saturday.
“I’ll be honest with the team,” Rizzo said. “I’m not going to try to come in and play if I can’t, but I’ll definitely do my best. Hopefully it’s sooner than later.”
Rice played 49 games at first base and initially was called up after Rizzo’s first injury.
Drafted as a catcher out of Dartmouth in 2021, Rice batted .171 with seven homers and 23 RBIs. In the field, he committed two errors in 289 chances for a .993 fielding percentage.
“He’s obviously gained a lot of experience at first base this year and I feel like he handled that all really well,” Boone said. “I feel like he handled himself defensively, maybe even better than I anticipated.”
Rice slumped after hitting three homers against the Red Sox on July 7, hitting .117 (11 for 94) in the final 31 games of his first stint before being optioned to the minors on Aug. 31. At Triple-A, Rice batted .293 with 12 homers and 33 RBIs in 30 games.
Rizzo hit .228 with eight homers and 35 RBIs in 92 games this season, including .380 (8 for 21) since returning from the injured list on Sept. 1.
A three-time All-Star, Rizzo’s 2023 season was derailed on May 28 when he collided with San Diego’s Fernando Tatis Jr. attempting to apply a tag on a pickoff try. He was diagnosed with a concussion two months later and hit .174 with 10 RBIs in 47 games after colliding with Tatis, finishing with a .244 average, 12 homers and 41 RBIs.
The Yankees acquired Rizzo from the Cubs at the 2021 trade deadline and re-signed him to a $40 million, two-year contract after he hit .224 with 32 homers and 75 RBIs in 130 games in 2022. New York has a $17 million option for 2025 with a $6 million buyout.
Cabrera, who has made five starts at first base, also could be an option,
DJ LeMahieu has not played since Sept. 3 because of right hip impingement. He will participate in workouts ahead of the ALDS.
“I think as I’ve said, Oswaldo with a glove on I’m good with,” Boone said. “He’s got a lot of work over at first this year, even going back to spring training a little bit.”
Reliever Jake Cousins, on the injured list with a right pectoral strain, threw on back-to-back days before taking Sunday off. The 30-year-old right-hander is to throw again Monday, have a bullpen session Tuesday and face hitters Thursday.
Cousins was injured Sept. 20 in Seattle and is 2-1 with a 2.37 ERA with one save in 37 appearances.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Hearing the familiar sounds of clacking sticks and pucks banging off the boards and glass while watching Columbus Blue Jackets prospects from the stands of a cold rink on a warm late-summer afternoon was not enough to wash away the lingering residuals of grief for Don Waddell on Saturday.
That, the Blue Jackets’ general manager acknowledged, will take more time than anyone can guess — weeks, months, perhaps an entire season and beyond.
What mattered is how spending the weekend attending the Sabres Prospects Challenge represented a start to what Waddell called among the first steps in refocusing on hockey and the future in the aftermath of the deaths of Columbus star Johnny Gaudreau and his brother, Matthew, who were struck by a suspected drunken driver while riding bicycles on Aug 29.
“We got to play hockey,” Waddell said. “We’re not going to forget about Johnny and his family, the Gaudreau family.”
He then reflected on the speech Johnny Gaudreau’s wife, Meredith, made during the brothers’ funeral on Monday, by urging those in mourning to move forward as she will while focusing on raising their children.
“Everybody knows that Johnny wants them to play hockey,” Waddell said. “And everybody’s rallying around that.”
The resumption of hockey in Columbus began last week, when most Blue Jackets players returned to their facility to be together and lean on each other at the urging of Waddell and team captain Boone Jenner. And it will continue on Thursday, when the team opens training camp, exactly three weeks since the Gaudreaus were killed.


“Tragic. Senseless. But now we got to focus on trying to get our team ready to play hockey this year,” Waddell said. “We all mourn and heal differently, but I think as a team being together like that is going to be critical for them to get moving forward.”
Tragedy is no stranger to Waddell or the Blue Jackets.
Waddell was general manager of the then-Atlanta Thrashers in 2003 when Dany Heatley lost control of his car and struck a wall, with the crash killing passenger and teammate Dan Snyder. In 2021, Blue Jackets goalie Matiss Kivlenieks died during a July Fourth fireworks accident.
Waddell placed the emphasis on himself and coach Dean Evason — both newcomers to Columbus this offseason — to guide the team through what will be an emotional season.
“Now, do I think there’s going to be some dark days? I won’t be surprised,” Waddell said.
Reminders of the Gaudreaus’ deaths remain apparent, and reflected in Buffalo on Friday night. A moment of silence was held in tribute to the brothers before the opening faceoff of a game between the Blue Jackets and Sabres.
Afterward, Columbus prospect Gavin Brindley recalled the times he spent with Johnny Gaudreau in Columbus and as teammates representing the United States at the world hockey championships in the Czech Republic in May.
“He was one of the biggest mentors for me at the world championships,” Brindley said. “I couldn’t tell you how many times we hung out with Meredith, pictures on my phone. It’s just so hard to look back and see that kind of stuff.”
The NHL and NHL Players’ Association are providing the Blue Jackets help in the form of grief counseling, crowd security at vigils and addressing hockey issues, such as potentially altering the league’s salary cap rules to provide Columbus relief from having to reach the NHL minimum payroll because of the void left by Gaudreau’s contract.
“The Blue Jackets, I don’t think anybody’s focused from an organizational standpoint, from a hockey standpoint as to what comes next, because I think everybody’s still in shock,” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman told The Associated Press last week. “I don’t think anybody’s focused right now other than on the grieving part, which is understandable.”
Much of the burden has fallen to Waddell, who has been in discussions with the NHL and the NHLPA and dealing with outreach programs with the Blue Jackets’ partner OhioHealth, while also overseeing preparations for training camp and gauging his prospects in Buffalo.
There’s also his roster to attend to, which he said has two openings at forward, one involving Justin Danforth, who may miss the start of the season because of a wrist injury. Waddell didn’t have to mention the second opening.
Tiring and emotional as it’s been, Waddell found comfort being in his element, a rink, and looking ahead to the start of training camp.
“The guys are in really good shape. We’ve done a lot of testing already and they’re eager to get going,” Waddell said. “We have a reason to play for. And we’ll make the best of it.”
The Blue Jackets later Sunday signed veteran winger James van Riemsdyk to a one-year contract worth $900,000. 
“James van Riemsdyk has been a very consistent, productive player throughout his career,” Waddell said. “Bringing him to Columbus will not only provide depth to our group up front, but also valuable leadership and another veteran presence in our dressing room.”

WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) — William Byron’s Chevy skidded down the track and came to rest tilted against the wall with a tire jammed into Brad Keselowski’s driver-side window in a late fight for position between two NASCAR playoff drivers.
Ryan Blaney never got so lucky to remain in the second playoff race long enough to gobble playoff points. The 2023 NASCAR champion was knocked out at Watkins Glen International on the opening lap Sunday, his Ford towed to the garage against his wishes.
Denny Hamlin, Martin Truex Jr., Harrison Burton. The list of playoff drivers that took a beating on the track — and in the standings — dwarfed the ones that escaped the road course unscathed.
Already set to retire from full-time racing at the end of the season, Truex had seen enough of the demolition derby that sabotaged his championship push.
“I just don’t understand how guys can call themselves the best in the world when they just drive through everyone on restarts at the end of the races,” Truex said. “It is what it is, these days. I’m out of here.”
With championship contenders succumbing to late wrecks, shredded tires, and aggressive driving, Chris Buescher played spoiler and won Sunday at Watkins Glen International, leading a string of five non-playoff drivers to the finish.
“We would have liked to have won a couple of weeks ago, but this is huge,” Buescher said.
The chaos on the 2.45-mile course at The Glen — in the playoffs for the first time before it returns to an August date next year — shook up the playoff standings heading into the cutoff race.


Buescher held off Shane van Gisbergen in the thrilling two final overtime laps and won for the first time this season for RFK Racing. The 31-year-old Texan, who started 24th, has six career victories.
Chase Briscoe, who entered 16th in the playoff standings and 21 points behind the cutline, was sixth and the highest-finishing playoff driver in the field in the second race in NASCAR’s postseason. Four drivers will be cut from the field Saturday night at Bristol Motor Speedway.
“I did what we needed to do,” Briscoe said. “Just need to go do that same thing next week. Just hit singles and doubles. Don’t do anything crazy.”
Briscoe shot to 11th in the standings, six points above the cutline. Hamlin, Brad Keselowski, Truex, and Burton are the bottom four drivers.
Austin Cindric was 10th, only the second playoff driver in the top 10. Want to find the contenders? Look all the way to the bottom of the race results. Ten playoff drivers were dumped in the bottom 21 finishers.
The race was bedlam for the contenders from the start, when a wreck on the opening lap that knocked out Blaney also slowed fellow playoff drivers and Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Hamlin and Christopher Bell.
At least 11 playoff drivers ran into some sort of issue, including a rough scene late in the race where Keselowski and Byron crashed battling for position. Byron’s Chevrolet landed on top of Keselowski’s Ford with six laps left in the scheduled 90-lap race.
There was no way this thriller wasn’t going to end in regulation.
One by one, playoff drivers took a beating on the track — and in the standings. 
Joey Logano raced his way into the second round of NASCAR’s playoffs by winning the opener last week at Atlanta Motor Speedway. He finished 15th There was no automatic qualifier at The Glen into the second round.
Bell finished 14th and holds a 46-point lead in the standings.
Kyle Larson, Byron, Briscoe and Ty Gibbs are the final four drivers above the cutline. Hamlin is six points out, Keselowski 12, Truex 14 and Burton is 20 points out of the final spot.
Blaney, the 2023 Cup champion, had his race ended on the opening lap after he was collected in a wreck that also involved playoff drivers Hamlin and Bell.
Blaney went from 45 points above the cutline to 29.
NASCAR rules dictated the No. 12 Ford must be towed to the garage, while Blaney argued his team should have been allowed to try and repair the car on pit road, giving him a shot at staying in the race.
“They didn’t give us a chance to fix it,” Blaney said. “How are they going to dictate if we are done or not? They have no idea of the damage. They said we were done because I couldn’t drive it back to the pit box, but if you have four flats, you get towed back to the pit box. You can’t drive that back. I don’t know what is going on or why they won’t give us a shot to work on it but I don’t agree with.”
NASCAR rules say cars can remain in the race for mechanical issues, not for damage.
Juan Pablo Montoya finished 32nd driving for 23XI Racing in his first Cup race in 10 years.
A two-time Indianapolis 500 winner, Montoya never quite reached the heights in NASCAR that he did in his IndyCar, sports cars and Formula 1 careers. He won the Cup race at The Glen in 2010.
NASCAR heads to its playoff cutoff race at Bristol where Hamlin is the defending race winner.
“I feel like we can go there and win,” Hamlin said. “We are going to an oval, back to a normal track. We can control our own destiny there.”

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Ronel Blanco threw six scoreless innings, Jason Heyward had a home run among his three hits and the Houston Astros finished off a three-game sweep of the Los Angeles Angels with a 6-4 victory on Sunday.
Jeremy Peña had two hits and two runs scored as the Astros won their fourth consecutive game and remained 4 1/2 games ahead of the Seattle Mariners in the American League West.
Blanco (11-6) allowed two walks and had five strikeouts in his return to the starting rotation after pitching two innings of scoreless relief Sept. 7 against Arizona. Blanco was used out of the bullpen for a game to manage his usage in his first full season in the majors.
“The thing that helped me a ton was being able to have that rest before this outing,” Blanco said through an interpreter.
Josh Hader recorded the final two outs for his 31st save in 33 opportunities.
Despite just 52 appearances and 34 starts since 2022, Blanco is expected to play a key role into October.
“Looking at the second half, I was looking at the things I was doing wrong and the things I could make better,” Blanco said. “The fastball was one (area of improvement). I thought I was missing up way too much with the fastball. I told myself to attack the strike zone more.”
Taylor Ward hit a home run and rookie Eric Wagaman had two hits for the Angels, who lost their fifth consecutive game and fell for the seventh time in their last eight. The Angels dropped to 60-89, matching their loss total from the 2022 and 2023 seasons. 


Angels rookie right-hander Caden Dana (1-2) went 3 1/3 innings in his third career start, giving up five runs on five hits with two walks and three strikeouts.
“The only ball they got in the air, of all the hits they got, was the one Heyward hit,” Angels manager Ron Washington said of Dana’s outing. “You want the ball down on the ground and today they found the holes. He was a little flat with his fastball but he had a good changeup working.”
In his fourth game in the starting lineup since debuting with the Astros on Sept. 1, Heyward hit a home run, his eighth, in his first at bat to give Houston a 1-0 lead in the third.
“If (Heyward) gets a pitch in an area he likes it, he’s not going to miss,” Astros manager Joe Espada said. “He hits the ball hard and he plays hard too. That’s something that I have always admired from Jason.”
Heyward, who was released by the Los Angeles Dodgers on Aug. 24, reached base a fourth time after getting aboard on catcher’s interference in the eighth inning.
“It’s nice to have a job with a team competing to win and wanting to win a World Series,” Heyward said. “That really does make a difference because that is hard. It’s hard to be the last team standing. So it’s just nice to step into another clubhouse with that mentality, that mindset and experience.”
Heyward had an RBI single in a four-run fourth that also included RBI singles from Peña and Mauricio Dubon. Peña scored a run in the inning on a passed ball by Angels catcher Logan O’Hoppe.
Jake Meyers gave the Astros a 6-0 lead in the eighth on an RBI single to right. Ward ended the Astros’ shutout bid with his home run in the eighth off Kaleb Ort, his 24th.
The Angels scored three times in the ninth with all three runs charged to left-hander Caleb Ferguson. Gustavo Campero had a run-scoring ground out in his major league debut and Charles Leblanc had a two-run single.
Astros pitching coach Joshua Miller was ejected by third base umpire Dan Iassogna for arguing a hit-by-pitch call in the bottom of the ninth.
Astros: OF Ben Gamel was not in the lineup after sustaining a knee contusion in Saturday’s game. ... OF Kyle Tucker made his second start in right field since returning Sept. 6 from a right shin fracture. ... 1B Jon Singleton was a late scratch with an illness and was replaced by Victor Caratini.
Angels: OF Mickey Moniak was hit by a pitch on his left hand in the ninth and left the game. ... An MRI on the right shoulder of RHP Ben Joyce revealed only inflammation but the team still will shut down the reliever, whose last pitch of the season on Sept. 3 was a 105.5-mph fastball. ... RHP Carson Fulmer (right elbow inflammation) was reinstated from the injured list, while both OF Bryce Teodosio (right middle finger fracture) and LHP Sam Aldegheri (left middle finger blister) were placed on the IL.
Astros: RHP Spencer Arrighetti (7-12, 4.72 ERA) is scheduled to pitch in the opener of a three-game road series against the San Diego Padres.
Angels: LHP Reid Detmers (4-6, 5.64 ERA) is scheduled to pitch in the opener of a three-game road series against the Chicago White Sox.

Over 140 Ukrainian drones targeted multiple Russian regions overnight, including Moscow and surrounding areas, killing at least one person and injuring eight, officials said Tuesday, in one of the biggest drone attacks on Russian soil in the 2 1/2-year war.
A woman died in the town of Ramenskoye, just outside Moscow, where drones hit two multistory residential buildings and started fires, Moscow region Gov. Andrei Vorobyov said. Five residential buildings were evacuated due to falling drone debris, Vorobyov said.
The attack also prompted the authorities to shut three airports just outside Moscow — Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky — forcing 48 flights to be diverted to other airports, according to Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia. 
The first two airports, which are Russia’s second- and third-busiest, reopened in the morning but Zhukovsky was still closed in the afternoon because law enforcement officers were dealing with drone debris there, an airport spokesperson told the Interfax news agency.
It was the second massive Ukrainian drone attack on Russia this month. On Sept. 1, the Russian military said it intercepted 158 Ukrainian drones over more than a dozen Russian regions in what Russian media described as the biggest Ukrainian drone barrage since the start of the war. Russia’s Investigative Committee announced a criminal investigation into what it described as a terror attack.
Russia has pummeled Ukraine with missiles, glide bombs and its own drones, killing over 10,000 civilians since the war began in 2022, according to the United Nations.


Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 46 Shahed drones and two missiles at Ukraine overnight. The air force said it downed 36 of the drones.
Ukraine has invested a lot of effort in developing domestic drone production, extending drones’ range, payload and uses. It has increasingly utilized drone blitzes to slow Russia’s war machine, disrupt Russian society and provoke the Kremlin.
Ukrainian officials have complained that weapons pledged by the country’s Western partners fall short of what their military needs and commonly arrive long after promised. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged defense companies to increase their output.
On the battlefield’s 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, Ukrainian troops are up against Russia’s larger and better-equipped army. The two sides are especially contesting parts of eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, fighting over towns and villages that are bombed-out wrecks, while Ukraine last month launched a bold incursion into Russia’s Kursk border region.
In Moscow on Monday night, drone debris fell on a private house on the outskirts of the city, but no one was hurt, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. He counted over a dozen drones heading toward Moscow that were shot down by air defenses as they were approaching the city.
Overall, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it “intercepted and destroyed” 144 Ukrainian drones over nine Russian regions, including those on the border with Ukraine and those deeper inside Russia.
Ukrainian officials declined to comment on the attack.
As the war drags on, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been expanding his alliances:
The Russian military on Tuesday began massive naval and air drills, involving over 90,000 troops and over 400 warships, that China will also take part in, the Defense Ministry said.
Putin is also beefing up his military arsenal with Iranian ballistic missiles, the United States and Britain said Tuesday.
Moscow and the surrounding region have often come under attack throughout the war.
In May 2023, Russian officials said Ukraine tried to attack the Kremlin with drones which lightly damaged the roof of the palace that includes one of Putin’s official residences.
In August 2023, a drone attack on Moscow’s prestigious business district blew out part of a section of windows on a high-rise building and sent glass cascading to the streets, unsettling Muscovites. The attacks exposed gaps in the city and region’s air defenses.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Rookie Brooks Lee had five RBIs, Carlos Santana went 3 for 4 with a two-run homer and the Minnesota Twins rallied to beat the Cincinnati Reds 9-2 Sunday for just their fourth win in 12 games.
Ryan Jeffers had two hits and two runs for the Twins, who scored eight times in the sixth and seventh innings to avoid a three-game sweep. 
“Hitting’s contagious. It always helps when there are guys on base,” said Lee, whose two-run single in the sixth gave the Twins the lead. “It’s fun with guys on base. I feel like you get more pitches to hit, there’s more chance for damage.”
Minnesota (79-70) maintained a 2 1/2-game lead over Detroit and Seattle (both 77-73) for the last AL wild card spot. The Twins play at Cleveland on Monday, starting a seven-game trip that ends in Boston. 
“Honestly, I don’t think we’re really playing tight,” Jeffers said. “It’s just how this game goes. You’re hot, you’re cold. You hope that while some guys are cold, some other guys are hot. It just so happened that for a week or so, the two-week stretch or whatever it is, there hasn’t been many guys that are hot to carry the load. But hopefully, with that being said, we can all get hot together.”
Cole Sands (8-1) allowed one hit in two scoreless innings, as did Jorge Alcala, who struck out four.
“Our pitching did a good job of stabilizing the middle of the game, and then the bats were able to break through,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “We had multiple big hits and big at-bats and guys getting on base. A lot of what we were aiming for, we got.”


With the Twins trailing 2-1 in the sixth, Santana hit a one-out double off Rhett Lowder (1-2), who made his fourth major league start. Trevor Larnach walked, Tony Santillan struck out Willi Castro, Jeffers hit an RBI double and Lee singled for a 4-2 lead.
Santana hit a two-run homer in the seventh against Justin Wilson, a drive off the facing of the second deck in left, and Lee had a a bases-loaded triple down the right field line.
“Every day is a new day, a new game,” said Santana, a 15-year veteran who’s playing his first season with the Twins. “Today is great. This is the game we need. We have 13 more games left and we have to finish strong.”
Twins starter David Festa gave up two run, three hits and three walks in 3 2/3 innings, the second straight Minnesota starter who didn’t get out of the fourth inning.
Spencer Steer hit an RBI triple in the fourth and scored on Ty France’s sacrifice fly.
Reds: LHP Brandon Williamson (0-0, 2.08) starts against Atlanta on Tuesday, beginning the Reds’ final homestand.
Twins: RHP Pablo López (15-8, 3.88) will take the mound on Monday to start a four-game series in Cleveland. The first-place Guardians will counter with LHP Matt Boyd (2-1, 2.18).

The Associated Press national player of the week in football for Week 2 of the season:
The Sun Devils’ fourth-year running back rushed for a career-high 262 yards and finished with 297 all-purpose yards in a 30-23 win over Mississippi State.
Skattebo’s 33 carries are the FBS single-game high so far this season. His final run was his longest, going for 39 yards to the Mississippi State 12 and allowing the Sun Devils to run out the clock.
He averaged 7.9 yards per carry while amassing the second-highest rushing total in program history behind Eno Benjamin’s 312 yards against Oregon State in 2018. His 12 runs of at least 10 yards, all against Mississippi State, lead the nation.
Skattebo, a native of Rio Linda, California, who transferred from Sacramento State for the 2023 season, also caught three passes for a team-high 35 yards.
Xavier Scott, Illinois. The third-year defensive back from Riviera Beach, Florida, had his fingerprints all over the Illini’s 23-17 win over then-No. 19 Kansas.
He was in on three takeaways, including an interception return for a touchdown, and he recorded a sack and finished with a team-leading eight solo tackles.
His interception on Kansas’ first series set up a field goal, and his 30-yard pick-6 put the Illini up 13-10 late in the first half. With the Jayhawks at the Illinois 46, Scott knocked the ball loose from Jalen Daniels and teammate Alec Bryant recovered to end the game.


Northern Illinois DT Cade Haberman blocked a 48-yard field-goal attempt to end the first half and a 62-yarder at the end of the game to preserve the 16-14 upset of then-No. 5 Notre Dame; Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty ran for 192 yards and three touchdowns in 27-24 loss to then-No. 7 Oregon. Syracuse QB Kyle McCord passed for 381 yards and four touchdowns as the Orange held on to beat then-No. 23 Georgia Tech 31-28.
— Rutgers RB Kyle Monangai has never fumbled on 459 rushing attempts since 2021.
— Penn State’s Drew Allar has an interception rate of 0.6% on 486 career attempts, best among FBS players with a minimum of 200, according to SportRadar. He threw an interception against Bowling Green on Saturday for his first of the season but just the third in 15 career games. 
— North Carolina’s Jahvaree Ritzie leads the nation with five sacks in two games. He had a total of 2.5 sacks over his 40 previous games.
— Georgia heads to Kentucky with 15 straight road wins, the FBS’ longest active streak.
— Missouri has scored on 66 of 68 trips into the red zone since the start of the last season, according to SportRadar. That’s a 97.1% success rate that leads the nation among teams with at least 10 drives inside the opponents’ 20-yard line.
— SMU’s Collin Rogers set a school record with five goals and accounted for all his team’s scoring in an 18-15 loss to BYU. He had kicks of 53, 52, 45, 38 and 28 yards.

                Question: What is the name of the school in Louisville, Kentucky, where a vaccination clinic was held on September 15, 2024?
                Answer: ",Newcomer Academy,This city is hailed as a vaccination success.

Can it be sustained? - The Associated Press

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — On his first day of school at Newcomer Academy, Maikel Tejeda was whisked to the school library. The 7th grader didn’t know why.
He soon got the point: He was being given make-up vaccinations. Five of them.
“I don’t have a problem with that,” said the 12-year-old, who moved from Cuba early this year.
Across the library, a group of city, state and federal officials gathered to celebrate the school clinic, and the city. With U.S. childhood vaccination rates below their goals, Louisville and the state were being praised as success stories: Kentucky’s vaccination rate for kindergarteners rose 2 percentage points in the 2022-2023 school year compared with the year before. The rate for Jefferson County — which is Louisville — was up 4 percentage points.
“Progress is success,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But that progress didn’t last. Kentucky’s school entry vaccination rate slipped last year. Jefferson County’s rate slid, too. And the rates for both the county and state remain well below the target thresholds.
It raises the question: If this is what success looks like, what does it say about the nation’s ability to stop imported infections from turning into community outbreaks?
Local officials believe they can get to herd immunity thresholds, but they acknowledge challenges that includes tight funding, misinformation and well-intended bureaucratic rules that can discourage doctors from giving kids shots.


“We’re closing the gap,” said Eva Stone, who has managed the county school system’s health services since 2018. “We’re not closing the gap very quickly.”
Public health experts focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and the launching pad for community outbreaks. 
For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to mandates that required key vaccinations as a condition of school attendance. 
But they have slid in recent years. When COVID-19 started hitting the U.S. hard in 2020, schools were closed, visits to pediatricians declined and vaccination record-keeping fell off. Meanwhile, more parents questioned routine childhood vaccinations that they used to automatically accept, an effect that experts attribute to misinformation and the political schism that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines.
A Gallup survey released last month found that 40% of Americans said it is extremely important for parents to have their children vaccinated, down from 58% in 2019. Meanwhile, a recent University of Pennsylvania survey of 1,500 people found that about 1 in 4 U.S. adults think the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism — despite no medical evidence for it.
All that has led more parents to seek exemptions to school entry vaccinations. The CDC has not yet reported national data for the 2023-2024 school year, but the proportion of U.S. kindergartners exempted from school vaccination requirements the year before hit a record 3%.
Overall, 93% of kindergartners got their required shots for the 2022-2023 school year. The rate was 95% in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Officials worry slipping vaccination rates will lead to disease outbreaks. 
The roughly 250 U.S. measles cases reported so far this year are the most since 2019, and Oregon is seeing its largest outbreak in more than 30 years. 
Kentucky has been experiencing its worst outbreak of whooping cough — another vaccine-preventable disease — since 2017. Nationally, nearly 14,000 cases have been reported this year, the most since 2019.
The whooping cough surge is a warning sign but also an opportunity, said Kim Tolley, a California-based historian who wrote a book last year on the vaccination of American schoolchildren. She called for a public relations campaign to “get everybody behind” improving immunizations.
Much of the discussion about raising vaccination rates centers on campaigns designed to educate parents about the importance of vaccinating children — especially those on the fence about getting shots for their kids. 
But experts are still hashing out what kind of messaging work best: Is it better, for example, to say “vaccinate” or “immunize’’?
A lot of the messaging is influenced by feedback from small focus groups. One takeaway is some people have less trust in health officials and even their own doctors than they once did. Another is that they strongly trust their own feelings about vaccines and what they’ve seen in Internet searches or heard from other sources. 
“Their overconfidence is hard to shake. It’s hard to poke holes in it,” said Mike Perry, who ran focus groups on behalf of a group called the Public Health Communications Collaborative.
But many people seem more trusting of older vaccines. And they do seem to be at least curious about information they didn’t know, including the history of research behind vaccines and the dangers of the diseases they were created to fight, he said.
Some of the CDC’s recent communications take a gentle approach. 
One example is a digital media ad that depicts a boy playing with a toy Tyrannosaurus rex. The caption reads, “He thinks ‘diphtheria’ is the name of a dinosaur.” It’s an attempt to use humor while sending a message that children no longer know much about the infections that used to be common threats — and it’s better to keep it that way.
Dolores Albarracin has studied vaccination improvement strategies in 17 countries, and repeatedly found that the most effective strategy is to make it easier for kids to get vaccinated.
“In practice, most people are not vaccinating simply because they don’t have money to take the bus” or have other troubles getting to appointments, said Albarracin, director of the communication science division within Penn’s Annenberg Public Policy Center.
That’s a problem in Louisville, where officials say few doctors were providing vaccinations to children enrolled in Medicaid and fewer still were providing shots to kids without any health insurance. An analysis a few years ago indicated 1 in 5 children — about 20,000 kids — were not current on their vaccinations, and most of them were poor, said Stone, the county school health manager.
A 30-year-old federal program called Vaccines for Children pays for vaccinations for children who Medicaid-eligible or lack the insurance to cover it. 
But in a meeting with the CDC director last month, Louisville health officials lamented that most local doctors don’t participate in the program because of paperwork and other administrative headaches. And it can be tough for patients to get the time and transportation to get to those few dozen Louisville providers who do take part.
The school system has tried to fill the gap. In 2019, it applied to become a VFC provider, and gradually established vaccine clinics. 
Last year, it held clinics at nearly all 160 schools, and it’s doing the same thing this year. The first was at Newcomer Academy, where many immigrant students behind on their vaccinations are started in the school system.
It’s been challenging, Stone said. Funding is very limited. There are bureaucratic obstacles, and a growing influx of children from other countries who need shots. It takes multiple trips to a doctor or clinic to complete some vaccine series. And then there’s the opposition — vaccination clinic announcements tend to draw hateful social media comments.
But there’s also a lot of support. The local health department and nursing schools are crucial partners, and city leaders support the endeavor. 
At the recent vaccination celebration, Mayor Craig Greenberg acknowledged access problems and that vaccinations have become politicized. 
But “to me, there’s nothing political about improving public health, about improving the health of our kids,” said Greenberg, a Democrat. “There should be no debate about that.”

PARIS (AP) — The French presidential palace unveiled a long-awaited new government Saturday dominated by conservatives and centrists. It came more than two months after elections that produced a hung parliament and deepened political divisions as France grapples with growing financial and diplomatic challenges.
A left-wing coalition secured the most seats in June-July parliamentary elections but failed to win a majority. Student groups and activists from the hard-left France Unbowed party held protests around the country Saturday against a government they say rejects the voters’ will.
President Emmanuel Macron named conservative Michel Barnier as prime minister earlier this month even though Barnier’s Republicans party had a poor showing in the elections, and Barnier put together the government after difficult negotiations. Macron approved, and it was announced at the presidential palace.
Marine Le Pen ‘s far-right anti-immigration party National Rally has no seats in Barnier’s government, but has enough votes in parliament to bring it down. The party won an indirect victory with the appointment of staunch conservative Bruno Retailleau as new interior minister, whose remit includes critical domestic issues like national security, immigration, and law enforcement.
The makeup and direction of France’s government is important because the country is a leading voice in EU policy, among the biggest world’s economies and a nuclear-armed, veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council.


The 39-member Cabinet includes primarily ministers from Macron’s centrist alliance and the conservative Republicans.
Jean-Noël Barrot is the new foreign minister, a centrist politician known for his work in digital transformation and European affairs. He brings extensive experience in navigating complex international issues notably within the EU.
The new finance minister is Antoine Armand, an emerging figure in French politics now tasked with steering France’s fiscal policies and managing the upcoming 2025 budget, amid pressure from Brussels to address France’s mounting debt.
Sébastien Lecornu retains his post as defense minister. He has been instrumental in bolstering France’s military capabilities, including modernizing defense systems and managing military aid to Ukraine. His leadership in defense will be crucial as France navigates its role within NATO and handles rising geopolitical tensions over the wars in Ukraine and the Mideast.
Barnier’s ability to govern effectively is already under scrutiny, with his political opponents on the left vowing to challenge him at every turn and the far right saying it will monitor the government closely.
The left-wing New Popular Front alliance surprised many by winning the most seats in the risky snap elections that Macron called in the wake of a far-right victory in European Parliament elections.
But the New Popular Front was not given a chance to form a minority government, and refused to make concessions and join a more left-leaning government alliance. 
Barnier, a 73-year-old political veteran known for his role as the European Union’s Brexit negotiator, is no stranger to complex political tasks. However, forming a government that can survive in such a divided parliament will test his extensive experience and political acumen. 
Barnier’s first major political test will come on October 1, when he is set to deliver his general policy speech to the National Assembly.

SEATTLE (AP) — The Miami Dolphins are again facing uncertainty at quarterback. 
One week after starter Tua Tagovailoa suffered a concussion, backup Skylar Thompson left the game midway through the third quarter of Sunday’s 24-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. 
Thompson had what coach Mike McDaniel called a painful rib injury, leaving the Dolphins with more questions at the most important position on the field after just three weeks of the season. 
Thompson’s final play was a 5-yard pass to De’Von Achane with 9:46 left in the third, but he took a hard shot on the previous drive when Seahawks linebacker Tyrel Dodson hit him for a sack, one of five he took on the day.
Thompson finished 13 of 19 for 107 yards, and was replaced by Tim Boyle at quarterback. 
“Half the pain or half of the frustration for him, I think was, he was really trying to find a way to not come out of the game,” McDaniel said. “And ultimately, it was pretty painful. He fought through it, but we’ll get a chance to look at him tomorrow.”
Thompson was slow to get up following the hit from Dodson and was slightly hunched over at the midsection as he ran off the field. He returned for the next series, but stayed down for several minutes after completing the pass to Achane. Thompson remained on his back for a few minutes before sitting up and walking directly to the locker room.
The injury to Thompson came a little over a week after Tagovailoa suffered his third concussion in the past two years in a loss to Buffalo. Tagovailoa was placed on injured reserve earlier this week, meaning he’s not an option for the Dolphins for at least four games. 


McDaniel didn’t reveal what the Dolphins’ plan is for the upcoming week if Thompson is unable to go for Miami’s home matchup against Tennessee next Monday night. Miami did sign Tyler Huntley off the Ravens’ practice squad earlier this week and he served as the third quarterback Sunday.

McDaniel sounded optimistic that the rest of the highly regarded offense would be able to bounce back, even with the team going through a roller-coaster couple of weeks under center. 
“I think consistency has to be found from the nucleus in the group,” McDaniel said. “The guys that truly know the offense have to really be on it and we have to just keep chopping wood and get better fast. ... Those things happen, and you know, every single season, there’s teams that find a way to win football games when their starter, or even their backup, is out.”
It was the third significant injury for the Dolphins in the game after left tackle Terron Armstead (eye) and cornerback Kendall Fuller (concussion) were injured in the first half. 
Fuller was hurt during the first quarter, was evaluated then ruled out early in the second half. Armstead’s injury was announced late in the second quarter and Kendall Lamm stepped in as his replacement. 
Seattle lost significant depth on its defensive line with injuries to Byron Murphy II and Leonard Williams in the first half. Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald didn’t have updates on either injury.

PHOENIX (AP) — Ketel Marte’s two-run homer capped a six-run fourth inning and the Arizona Diamondbacks stayed alive in the National League wild card race with an 11-2 rout of the playoff-bound San Diego Padres on Sunday in their regular-season finale.
Arizona finished 89-73 and won’t know if it reaches the postseason until a makeup doubleheader Monday between the New York Mets and Atlanta Braves, who are both 88-72.
If either team sweeps, the Diamondbacks reach the playoffs, but if the doubleheader is split, the Mets and Braves advance and Arizona is out.
“It’s weird. We don’t even know who to root for,” Diamondbacks outfielder Corbin Carroll said. “You just wait to see who wins the first game and root for them in the second. We’ll work out here and be ready to go.”
Arizona can only wait to find out if it travels to Milwaukee for a best-of-three Division Series against the Brewers.
“It sucks,” Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. “But there’s nothing we can do about it. We made this bed. We got to sleep in it, but we’re going to hope for the best. They’re two great franchises, two great managers, and I don’t think either have the gene of laying down.”
Lovullo knows how hard is to sweep a doubleheader.
“It’s always to challenge,” he said. “It’s going to be a battle of will, and the fatigue factor, but they’re both going to be hungry.”
San Diego (93-69) won’t learn until Monday where its Wild Card Series opponent will be the Mets or Braves.


Luis Arraez of the Padres doubled in the sixth inning to finish 1 for 3 and move to the verge of his third consecutive batting title at .314. He’s the first since 1900 to win three batting titles with three different teams.
Brandon Pfaadt (11-10) allowed two runs and three hits in 5 1/3 innings with nine strikeouts for the Diamondbacks, who had lost five of six.
“We used a little bit of everything,” Pfaadt said of his pitch selection. “When they put up a 6-spot in the fourth that kind of helps the pitching side.”
Ryne Nelson, activated from the injured list on Friday, pitched three innings for his first big league save, finishing a four-hitter.
Christian Walker’s double began a run of five straight hits in the fourth off Martín Pérez (5-6). Eugenio Suárez’s single drove in Walker and gave him 100 RBIs for the season.
Jake McCarthy’s run-scoring single, Gabriel Moreno’s RBI double and Geraldo Perdomo’s run-scoring grounder built a 4-1 lead, and Marte hit his 36th homer, a drive into the left-field second deck.
Pérez gave up six runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings.
Suárez hit his 30th homer off Matt Waldron to dead center field leading off the sixth and Randal Grichuk connected for his 12th with a man aboard in the eighth, also off Waldron.
Suárez hit 20 home runs after the All-Star break. Only Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge had more.
“After I have that first half, I wasn’t that good, and then be able to have 30 homers, it’s awesome,” he said. 
Arizona finished with five more wins than last year, when the Diamondbacks earned the last wild card and reached the World Series, where they lost to Texas.
Elias Diaz and Jake Cronenworth drove in runs for the Padres, who won 11 more games than last year and finished with their second-highest total behind 98 by the 1998 NL pennant winners.
A crowd of 38,892 gave Arizona a season attendance of 2,341,876, the Diamondbacks’ highest total since 2008 when they drew 2,509,924.
Padres: Host a wild card series beginning Tuesday.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The governor of Ohio will send law enforcement and millions of dollars in healthcare resources to the city of Springfield as it faces a surge in temporary Haitian migrants that has landed it in the national spotlight. 
Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday he doesn’t oppose the Temporary Protected Status program under which some 15,000 Haitians have arrived in the city of about 59,000 people since 2020, but said the federal government must do more to help impacted communities.
His news conference was held just hours before the presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former Republican President Donald Trump, where the divide over immigration policy was sure to be an issue. 
On Monday, Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost also drew attention to the crisis when he directed his office to research legal avenues — including filing a lawsuit — to stop the federal government from sending “an unlimited number of migrants to Ohio communities.”
Thousands of temporary Haitian migrants have landed in the city in recent years, as longstanding unrest in their home country has given way to violent gangs ruling the streets.
Ohio has already provided additional resources to Springfield to help with education and training for drivers, to pay for more vaccines and health screenings in schools, and to enhance translation services, explained DeWine. But he’s taking additional action. 


“These dramatic surges impact every citizen of the community, every citizen,” he said, noting additional influxes are occurring in Findlay and Lima, Ohio. “Moms who have to wait hours in a waiting room with a sick child, everyone who drives on the streets, and it affects children who go to school in more crowded classrooms.” 
On Wednesday, the Ohio State Highway Patrol will be dispatched to help local law enforcement with traffic issues that officials say have cropped up due to an increase in Haitians unfamiliar with U.S. traffic laws using the roads. DeWine said he is also earmarking $2.5 million over two years to provide more primary healthcare through the county health department and private healthcare institutions.
DeWine’s family operates a charity in Haiti in honor of their late daughter, Becky, who died in a car accident. He said the Haitians who have moved to Ohio are generally hard-working people who love their families and who are seeking to escape the violence in their home country for good jobs in Ohio.",False

Publication date:2024-09-09 07:00:00

TOKYO (AP) — A long robot entered a damaged reactor at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant on Tuesday, beginning a two-week, high-stakes mission to retrieve for the first time a tiny amount of melted fuel debris from the bottom.
The robot’s trip into the Unit 2 reactor is a crucial initial step for what comes next — a daunting, decades-long process to decommission the plant and deal with large amounts of highly radioactive melted fuel inside three reactors that were damaged by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Specialists hope the robot will help them learn more about the status of the cores and the fuel debris.
Here is an explanation of how the robot works, its mission, significance and what lies ahead as the most challenging phase of the reactor cleanup begins.
Nuclear fuel in the reactor cores melted after the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant’s cooling systems to fail. The melted fuel dripped down from the cores and mixed with internal reactor materials such as zirconium, stainless steel, electrical cables, broken grates and concrete around the supporting structure and at the bottom of the primary containment vessels.
The reactor meltdowns caused the highly radioactive, lava-like material to spatter in all directions, greatly complicating the cleanup. The condition of the debris also differs in each reactor.
Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, which manages the plant, says an estimated 880 tons of molten fuel debris remains in the three reactors, but some experts say the amount could be larger.


Workers will use five 1.5-meter-long (5-foot-long) pipes connected in sequence to maneuver the robot through an entry point in the Unit 2 reactor’s primary containment vessel. The robot itself can extend about 6 meters (20 feet) inside the vessel. Once inside, it will be maneuvered remotely by operators at another building at the plant because of the fatally high radiation emitted by the melted debris.
The front of the robot, equipped with tongs, a light and a camera, will be lowered by a cable to a mound of melted fuel debris. It will then snip off and collect a bit of the debris — less than 3 grams (0.1 ounce). The small amount is meant to minimize radiation dangers.
The robot will then back out to the place it entered the reactor, a roundtrip journey that will take about two weeks. 
The mission takes that long because the robot must make extremely precise maneuvers to avoid hitting obstacles or getting stuck in passageways. That has happened to earlier robots. 
TEPCO is also limiting daily operations to two hours to minimize the radiation risk for workers in the reactor building. Eight six-member teams will take turns, with each group allowed to stay maximum of about 15 minutes.
Sampling the melted fuel debris is “an important first step,” said Lake Barrett, who led the cleanup after the 1979 disaster at the U.S. Three Mile Island nuclear plant for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is now a paid adviser for TEPCO’s Fukushima decommissioning.
While the melted fuel debris has been kept cool and has stabilized, the aging of the reactors poses potential safety risks, and the melted fuel needs to be removed and relocated to a safer place for long-term storage as soon as possible, experts say. 
An understanding of the melted fuel debris is essential to determine how best to remove it, store it and dispose of it, according to the Japan Atomic Energy Agency.
Experts expect the sample will also provide more clues about how exactly the meltdown 13 years ago played out, some of which is still a mystery.
The melted fuel sample will be kept in secure canisters and sent to multiple laboratories for more detailed analysis. If the radiation level exceeds a set limit, the robot will take the sample back into the reactor.
“It’s the start of a process. It’s a long, long road ahead,” Barrett said in an online interview. “The goal is to remove the highly radioactive material, put it into engineered canisters ... and put those in storage.” 
For this mission, the robot’s small tong can only reach the upper surface of the debris. The pace of the work is expected to pick up in the future as more experience is gained and robots with additional capabilities are developed.
TEPCO will have to “probe down into the debris pile, which is over a meter (3.3 feet) thick, so you have to go down and see what’s inside,” Barrett said, noting that at Three Mile Island, the debris on the surface was very different from the material deeper inside. He said multiple samples from different locations must be collected and analyzed to better understand the melted debris and develop necessary equipment, such as stronger robots for future larger-scale removal.
Compared to collecting a tiny sample for analysis, it will be a more difficult challenge to develop and operate robots that can cut larger chunks of melted debris into pieces and put that material into canisters for safe storage. 
There are also two other damaged reactors, Unit 1 and Unit 3, which are in worse condition and will take even longer to deal with. TEPCO plans to deploy a set of small drones in Unit 1 for a probe later this year and is developing even smaller “micro” drones for Unit 3, which is filled with a larger amount of water. 
Separately, hundreds of spent fuel rods remain in unenclosed cooling pools on the top floor of both Unit 1 and 2. This is a potential safety risk if there’s another major quake. Removal of spent fuel rods has been completed at Unit 3.
Removal of the melted fuel was initially planned to start in late 2021 but has been delayed by technical issues, underscoring the difficulty of the process. The government says decommissioning is expected to take 30-40 years, while some experts say it could take as long as 100 years. 
Others are pushing for an entombment of the plant, as at Chernobyl after its 1986 explosion, to reduce radiation levels and risks for plant workers. 
That won’t work at the seaside Fukushima plant, Barrett says. 
“You’re in a high seismic area, you’re in a high-water area, and there are a lot of unknowns in those (reactor) buildings,” he said. “I don’t think you can just entomb it and wait.”",False

LONDON (AP) — With a few daubs of a paintbrush, the Brontë sisters have got their dots back.
More than eight decades after it was installed, a memorial to the three 19th-century sibling novelists in London’s Westminster Abbey was amended Thursday to restore the diaereses – the two dots over the e in their surname.
The dots — which indicate that the name is pronounced “brontay” rather than “bront” — were omitted when the stone tablet commemorating Charlotte, Emily and Anne was erected in the abbey’s Poets’ Corner in October 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II.
They were restored after Brontë historian Sharon Wright, editor of the Brontë Society Gazette, raised the issue with Dean of Westminster David Hoyle. The abbey asked its stonemason to tap in the dots and its conservator to paint them.
“There’s no paper record for anyone complaining about this or mentioning this, so I just wanted to put it right, really,” Wright said. “These three Yorkshire women deserve their place here, but they also deserve to have their name spelled correctly.”
It’s believed the writers’ Irish father Patrick changed the spelling of his surname from Brunty or Prunty when he went to university in England.
Raised on the wild Yorkshire moors, all three sisters died before they were 40, leaving enduring novels including Charlotte’s “Jane Eyre,” Emily’s “Wuthering Heights” and Anne’s “The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.”
Rebecca Yorke, director of the Brontë Society, welcomed the restoration.
“As the Brontës and their work are loved and respected all over the world, it’s entirely appropriate that their name is spelled correctly on their memorial,” she said.",False

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — The title defense for the Texas Rangers is over. The reigning World Series champions were eliminated from postseason contention during their last homestand of the season.
The Rangers went into Saturday night’s matchup with Seattle eight games behind Minnesota for the third AL wild card with eight to go. The Twins won the season series 5-2.
Houston entered Saturday with a magic number of four to clinch the division title. The Astros took the top spot in the AL West last season after tying the Rangers at 90-72 and winning the season series.
Texas edged Houston in a seven-game AL championship series last year before beating Arizona in five games in the World Series.
“I’d say we’re all disappointed with where we’re at now,” Texas manager Bruce Bochy said before his club’s second-to-last game at Globe Life Field this season. “It’s always difficult when you see these teams clinch and celebrating and you’re not, especially coming off the year that we had.”
A year after they were in first place in the AL West for all but one day over the first five months of the season, the Rangers didn’t lead the division after May 11.
Texas dropped below .500 with a loss to Philadelphia on May 21. The next loss for the Rangers (73-81) would clinch their seventh losing record in the past eight seasons.
The Rangers knew they would have to make it most of the season without ace Jacob deGrom coming off the right-hander’s elbow surgery in June 2023.


Fellow multiple Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer was limited to nine starts by a variety of health issues.
Outfielder Evan Carter, a rookie sensation in the postseason last year, didn’t play past May because of a bad back. Josh Jung, an All-Star third baseman as a rookie, missed three months with a broken wrist.
Among the players who didn’t have health issues, right fielder Adolis García and catcher Jonah Heim couldn’t match their offensive production from the championship season.
The Rangers were third in the majors in runs during their title season. They were tied for 21st going into the game against the Mariners.
“Offensively, we just didn’t show up like we did last year,” said All-Star second baseman Marcus Semien, who is about 20 points off his career batting average of .255. “In this league, you have to hit for power, you have to play good defense. I’ll always say that till I’m done playing. We didn’t always do that.” 
It will be the fourth time a Bochy-led team hasn’t made the postseason the year after winning the World Series. He won titles with San Francisco in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The Giants beat the Rangers for Bochy’s first championship.
“The thing that I loved is how we came out of the gate,” said Bochy, whose team was a season-high five games over .500 and in first place on May 8. “We actually played good baseball. The offense started struggling. We couldn’t find our way out of it. That’s what I think surprised everybody.”

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike hit a crowded Palestinian tent camp early Tuesday in Gaza, killing at least 19 people and wounding 60, Palestinian officials said. Israel said it targeted senior Hamas militants with precise munitions.
The strike occurred in Muwasi, a sprawl of camps along the coast that Israel designated as a humanitarian zone for hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians to seek shelter from the nearly year-old Israel-Hamas war.
Associated Press video showed three large craters. First responders dug with garden tools and bare hands, using mobile phone flashlights until the sun came up. They pulled body parts from the sand, including what appeared to be a human leg.
“We were told to go to Muwasi, to the safe area ... Look around you and see this safe place,” said Iyad Hamed Madi, who had been sheltering there.
“This is for my son,” he said, holding up a bag of diapers. “He’s 4 months old. Is he a fighter? There’s no humanity.”
Gaza’s Health Ministry said the death toll may rise as more bodies are recovered. The Civil Defense agency, composed of first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government, earlier said 40 were killed. The Israeli military disputed that toll.
The ministry is also part of the Hamas-run government. Its figures are widely seen as reliable.
The Hamas government’s media office said in a statement that the toll discrepancies arose from different methods of counting the dead, saying the Health Ministry counts only bodies taken to hospitals while the Civil Defense also counts bodies that have not yet been retrieved.


An AP cameraman at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis saw 10 bodies in the morgue, including two children and three women. It was one of three medical centers that received casualties, according to the Civil Defense.
“We were sleeping, and suddenly it was like a tornado,” Samar Moamer told the AP at the hospital, where she was being treated for wounds from the strike. She said one of her daughters was killed and the other was pulled alive from the rubble.
The Israeli military said it struck Hamas militants in a command center embedded in the area. It identified three of the militants, calling them senior operatives who were directly involved in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that triggered the war and other recent attacks.
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesperson, said in a post on the social media platform X that the initial casualty reports did “not line up with the information available to the (Israeli army), the precise weapons used and the accuracy of the strike.”
Hamas in a statement denied that any militants were in the area and called the Israeli allegations a “blatant lie.” Neither Israel nor Hamas provided evidence to support their claims.
Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because the militants often operate in residential areas and are known to position tunnels, rocket launchers and other infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques.
In July, Israel carried out a strike in the humanitarian zone that killed at least 90 Palestinians. The military said it targeted and killed Mohammed Deif, the shadowy leader of Hamas’ military wing, but Hamas says Deif is still alive.
International law allows for strikes on military targets in areas where civilians are present, provided the force used is proportionate to the military objective — something that is often disputed and would need to be settled in a court, which almost never happens.
The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Israeli evacuation orders, which now cover around 90% of the territory, have pushed hundreds of thousands of people into Muwasi, where aid groups have struggled to provide even basic services.
Gaza’s Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count, but says women and children make up just over half of the dead. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants in the war.
Hamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 hostage after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire last November. Around a third of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead.
The Israeli military on Tuesday released footage of a Gaza tunnel where it said six hostages were recently killed by Hamas. The video shows a low, narrow passageway with no bathroom and poor ventilation.
The discovery of the hostages’ bodies last month has sparked a mass outpouring of anger in Israel, and the new video could add to the pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal with Hamas to bring the remaining hostages home.
The United States and mediators Egypt and Qatar have spent much of this year trying to broker an agreement for a cease-fire and the release of the hostages, but the talks have repeatedly bogged down as Israel and Hamas have accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands.
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters Monday that conditions are ripe for at least a six-week pause in the fighting that would include the release of many of the hostages still held in Gaza. However, he would not commit to a permanent end to the fighting — a central Hamas demand.
The war has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis, and aid groups have struggled to operate because of fighting, Israeli restrictions and the breakdown of law and order.
In other developments Tuesday, the Israeli military said an American activist killed in the West Bank last week was likely shot “indirectly and unintentionally” by its soldiers, drawing a strong rebuke from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and her family.
Israel said a criminal investigation has been launched into the killing of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old activist from Seattle who was taking part in a demonstration against settlements in the Palestinian territory. Doctors who treated Eygi, who also held Turkish citizenship, said she was shot in the head.

PARIS (AP) — Alessandro Michele’s eagerly awaited ready-to-wear Paris Fashion Week debut at Valentino was unveiled in a setting that hinted at a transformation— a living room in flux. Stools, ladders, and lamps shrouded beneath white blankets evoked a house renovation, signaling not just change, but a conscious revival of past glories. The scene, poetic and subdued, perfectly set the stage for a “maximalist-lite” spectacle that was equally haunted by history and illuminated by Michele’s unique flair.
Meanwhile, under the soaring ceilings of the École des Beaux Arts, overlooking the Seine, Sean McGirr’s sophomore ready-to-wear show for Alexander McQueen arrived with a palpable sense of relief. The shift in setting — from a bleak industrial warehouse outside Paris to this iconic venue — reflected a fresh start for McGirr, whose uncertain debut had left critics shivering, both literally and figuratively. Now, with the benefit of more time to prepare, McGirr appeared more at ease, though hints of his sometimes overly simplistic approach still lingered. 
Here are some highlights of spring-summer 2025 ready-to-wear shows:
The mood was set with haunting music and the steady beat of a drum, creating an ambiance charged with drama and anticipation. Michele, who made headlines earlier this year after being named the new creative director of Valentino, following his successful reign at Gucci, brought with him much of his recognizable style. Yet there was a distinctive evolution in his vision — less overtly ostentatious, but still unmistakably eclectic.


Feathers floated on hats, soft and playful. Lingerie peeked through delicate layers. Flowers, fortune tellers’ hats, sparkling embellishments — all coalesced into an eclectic wardrobe that carried a vintage feel. Michele, it seemed, was teasing apart the DNA of both houses he knows intimately: the exuberance of Gucci and the ethereal heritage of Valentino.
Some of the pieces felt familiar to longtime Valentino admirers: the feminine nipped-waist dress, the floppy floral gown with its tiered skirt, and the iconic Valentino red that made its dramatic entrance. Yet in Michele’s hands, these classics were playfully twisted — feathers replaced fur on a billowing stole, and the result was a softer, more modern take that eschewed excessive luxury.
Jared Leto was among the VIPs who sat in the front row, a testament to Michele’s continued draw among Hollywood’s elite. The designer, who had risen to international recognition by infusing Gucci with his beloved “Geek-Chic” aesthetic, seemed to bring a similar ethos to Valentino, though filtered through a more graceful, couture lens.
Throughout his tenure at Gucci, Michele was celebrated for prioritizing his personal vision over the often suffocating codes of heritage houses, and Sunday’s show echoed that defiant spirit. 
The opening tailored suit, its lapels rolled as if to ward off an unexpected London downpour, seemed a pointed metaphor — perhaps a shield against the relentless skepticism that followed his first runway outing. This season, McGirr turned to a reference steeped in both his heritage and McQueen’s early days: the dark romance of the “Banshee” show. In doing so, he anchored his own identity more deeply in the label’s legacy, embracing a Gothic allure that was more commercially viable this time around.
It was a collection of contrasts. The precise tailoring echoed McQueen’s subversion of British suiting, twisting and clutching fabric in ways that seemed as though it had been caught in a sudden gust. However, this wasn’t always effective. One such example — a jagged, off-white tuxedo — felt more like a costume of restraint. This overly simplistic take on tailoring lacked the subtle layering and tension that distinguished Sarah Burton’s previous work for the house. 
Where McGirr truly shone, however, was in his eveningwear — an area that has become increasingly vital in the era of celebrity-driven fashion. The shimmering embroideries and featherlight silks, frayed and distressed in lilac georgette, signaled his understanding of red carpet glamour. The brushed white chiffon minidress, paired with a gold beaded and sequined jacket, made a convincing case for the designer’s growing confidence. And when the silver chains traced the body’s lines, their intricate embroidery brought a level of audacity that was finally worthy of McQueen.
The night’s high point was a look of pure excess: an extreme gown embroidered with glistening silver chains that seemed to catch every glimmer of light in the venue. It was an ensemble that Daphne Guinness herself — who watched approvingly from the front row — might have worn in a heartbeat. 
Despite his strides, McGirr’s sophomore effort still carried the weight of a designer learning the ropes of a storied brand. 
Akris’ Sunday collection had the audience leaning in, not for any over-the-top spectacle, but for the luxurious subtleties that Albert Kriemler so masterfully crafts. The designer, true to form, took the trench coat idea — a staple of the wardrobe — and transformed it into something distinctly Akris. With utilitarian detailing threaded through every seam, this was an exercise in functional luxury, the kind that Kriemler has long perfected. His designs don’t shout; they whisper. 
The collection opened with takes on trenches, each reimagined to fuse practicality with fashion-forward flair. Minimalism, too, reigned supreme, with looks that kept embellishments at bay to let the craftsmanship shine. A flat, clean-cut fabric top paired with culottes nodded to the timeless Akris aesthetic — unfussy, luxurious, and quietly powerful. This was minimalism of the highest quality, a testament to Kriemler’s commitment to making clothes that defy the viral trend, focusing instead on timeless appeal.",False

BUKWO, Uganda (AP) — Thousands of mourners in Uganda paid their respects Saturday to Rebecca Cheptegei, the Olympic athlete who died last week in Kenya after her partner set her on fire. The military funeral took place in a remote town near the Kenyan border. 
Military officers played a prominent role in the funeral because Cheptegei held the rank of sergeant in Uganda’s army, said military spokesman Brig. Felix Kulayigye, adding that she deserved a “gun salute that befits her rank.”
Athletes, family members and others delivered their eulogies before thousands in a sports field in the district of Bukwo. Many condemned domestic violence. 
“As a nation, we are indeed in a black and dark moment,” said Ajilong B. Modestar, the Bukwo resident district commissioner. “We condemn in the strongest terms the manner in which Rebecca died. ... We should not continue battering women in this manner.”
Cheptegei, who was 33, was buried at her father’s homestead.
She died after her body suffered 80% burns in the attack by Dickson Ndiema, who doused her in gasoline at her home in western Kenya’s Trans-Nzoia County on Sept. 3. Ndiema sustained 30% burns on his body and later succumbed to his injuries.
According to a report filed by the local chief, they quarreled over a piece of land the athlete bought in Kenya.
The horrific gasoline attack shocked many and strengthened calls for the protection of female runners facing exploitation and abuse in the East African country.


Cheptegei’s body was returned to Uganda on Friday in a somber procession following a street march by dozens of activists in the western Kenyan town of Eldoret who demanded an end to violence against female athletes.
Cheptegei is the fourth female athlete to have been killed by her partner in Kenya in a worrying pattern of gender-based violence in recent years. Kenya’s high rates of violence against women have prompted several marches this year.
Ugandan officials have condemned the attack, demanding justice for Cheptegei. First lady Janet Museveni, who also serves as Uganda’s education and sports minister, described the attack as “deeply disturbing.”
Don Rukare, chairman of the National Council of Sports of Uganda, said in a statement on X that the attack was “a cowardly and senseless act that has led to the loss of a great athlete.”
Four in 10 women, or an estimated 41% of dating or married Kenyan women, have experienced physical or sexual violence perpetrated by their current or most recent partner, according to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey.
Many Ugandan athletes train across the border in Kenya, an athletics powerhouse with better facilities. Some of the region’s best runners train together at a high-altitude center in Kenya’s west.
Cheptegei competed in the women’s marathon at the Paris Olympics, finishing in 44th place, less than a month before the attack. She had represented Uganda at other competitions.

DANIA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Scientists have moved about 300 endangered sea corals from South Florida to the Texas Gulf Coast for research and restoration.
Nova Southeastern University and Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi researchers packed up the corals Wednesday at the NSU’s Oceanographic Campus in Dania Beach. The sea creatures were then loaded onto a van, taken to a nearby airport and flown to Texas.
Researchers were taking extreme caution with the transfer of these delicate corals, NSU researcher Shane Wever said. 
“The process that we’re undertaking today is a really great opportunity for us to expand the representation of the corals that we are working with and the locations where they’re stored,” Wever said. “Increasing the locations that they’re stored really acts as safeguards for us to protect them and to preserve them for the future.”
Each coral was packaged with fresh clean sea water and extra oxygen, inside of a protective case and inside of insulated and padded coolers, and was in transport for the shortest time possible. 
NSU’s marine science research facility serves as a coral reef nursery, where rescued corals are stored, processed for restoration and transplanted back into the ocean. The school has shared corals with other universities, like the University of Miami, Florida Atlantic University and Texas State University, as well as the Coral Restoration Foundation in the Florida Keys.
Despite how important corals are, it is easy for people living on land to forget how important things in the ocean are, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi researcher Keisha Bahr said.


“Corals serve a lot of different purposes,” Bahr said. “First of all, they protect our coastlines, especially here in Florida, from wave energy and coastal erosion. They also supply us with a lot of the food that we get from our oceans. And they are nurseries for a lot of the organisms that come from the sea.”
Abnormally high ocean temperatures caused widespread coral bleaching in 2023, wiping out corals in the Florida Keys. Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi turned to NSU when its partners in the Keys were no longer able to provide corals for its research. Broward County was spared from the majority of the 2023 bleaching so the NSU offshore coral nursery had healthy corals to donate.
“We’re losing corals at an alarming rate,” Bahr said. “We lost about half of our corals in last three decades. So we need to make sure that we continue to have these girls into the future.”
Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi is using some of these corals to study the effects of sediment from Port Everglades on coral health. The rest will either help the university with its work creating a bleaching guide for the Caribbean or act as a genetic bank, representing nearly 100 genetically distinct Staghorn coral colonies from across South Florida’s reefs.
“We wanted to give them as many genotypes, which are genetic individuals, as we could to really act as a safeguard for these this super important species,” Wever said.",False

LIMA, Peru (AP) — Wildfires in Peru have left at least 15 dead since July and more than 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of cultivated land and natural areas scorched, authorities said Monday.
Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzén told reporters that the fires were started by human activity and that 22 of the 24 regions that make up the country have active outbreaks. He added that clouds, smoke and winds were hampering the operations of the aircraft available to fight the fires.
A Civil Defense report seen by The Associated Press indicates that since July at least 15 people have died and another 98 have been injured due to the fires. Of the fatalities, 10 died in the last two weeks and more than 1,800 people have been affected. The livestock sector was reported to have lost 334 animals.
Peru’s National Forest and Wildlife Service, SERFOR, indicated that the effects of climate change intensify the conditions that facilitate the spread of fire.
“Extremely strong winds and prolonged droughts dry out vegetation, turning it into highly flammable fuel,” said Romina Liza, a specialist in monitoring and management of forest Fires at SERFOR. “This allows the fires to spread rapidly.” 
Some of the most complicated fires are in the Amazon region, which borders Ecuador, the head of civil defense, Juan Urcariegui, told a local television station.

COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — There are two very different ways to look at seventh-ranked Missouri’s last two wins, a pair of come-from-behind affairs against Boston College and a double-overtime 30-27 victory over Vanderbilt in its SEC opener on Saturday night.
The Tigers were good enough to overcome their mistakes. Or their opponents weren’t good enough to capitalize on them.
Either way, Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz still has plenty to clean up before continuing the conference grind against No. 25 Texas A&M in two weeks, and with fourth-ranked Alabama and No. 15 Oklahoma still on the schedule later this season.
Opponents with much more talent, much more likely to bury a team that keeps committing penalties and mental mistakes.
“We have to take a hard look at the Missouri Tigers, and we have to figure out why we’re not executing on third downs, in the red area. Why we’re missing tackles, busting assignments,” Drinkwitz said. “I’m not even kind of worried about Texas A&M. I’m concerned about our team enjoying a win, being 4-0 — which is as good as we can be record-wise, but we’re not as good as we can be playwise. We have to settle in on that and see what we can do to improve.”
The Tigers (4-0, 1-0 SEC) escaped against Vanderbilt (2-2, 0-1) when Blake Craig atoned for three missed field goals by hitting from 37 yards in the second overtime, and Commodores counterpart Brock Taylor missed a 31-yarder to keep the game going.
“What we want is out front of us. That’s the message,” Vanderbilt coach Clark Lea said afterward. “We’re all hurt. We’re all in pain right now. But we’ll deal with that in the next three or four hours.”


What the Tigers want is still in front of them, too, despite all the mistakes that nearly doomed them against a Vanderbilt team that hadn’t beaten an opponent ranked as highly as the Tigers since No. 6 South Carolina on Oct. 20, 2007.
On the Commodores’ second possession, Missouri blew the coverage down the middle of the field, and Diego Pavia found Joseph McVay for a 65-yard touchdown reception that took the energy out of Faurot Field.
Later in the half, returner Theo Wease Jr. failed to field a short kickoff, which hopped past him and nearly to the goal line. Wease eventually picked it up, ran sideways and was fortunate to avoid a safety, getting tackled at the Missouri 2.
The Tigers’ biggest gaffe came at the end of the first half, though.
Missouri had just forged a 10-all tie when it forced Vanderbilt to go three-and-out. The Tigers picked up a quick first down but were held to fourth-and-3 near midfield with 12 seconds left. Rather than punt, Cook lined up and snapped the ball quickly, and he was sacked with 8 seconds to go. The turnover gave Vanderbilt the ball with enough time to run a short pass play, setting up a 57-yard field goal by Brock Taylor that gave Lea’s team the halftime lead.
“Totally my fault. That was a really haphazard decision by me,” Drinkwitz said, “and the team bailed me out. Bottom line.”
All those missteps came just one week after a cacophony of mistakes nearly cost the Tigers in their 27-21 win over Boston College. There was the broken play when the Eagles dropped the snap and proceeded to throw a 67-yard touchdown pass, and the eight penalties for 78 yards on Missouri, including two personal fouls and two flags for unsportsmanlike conduct.
Craig was 4 for 4 on field goals in that game, including a 56-yarder that helped him earn SEC special teams player of the week.
But the freshman kicker struggled mightily against Vanderbilt, banging an early 25-yarder off the upright and then missing from 40 and 46 yards in the fourth quarter, when either of the field goals would have given Missouri a 23-20 lead.
Vanderbilt began overtime with a touchdown pass from Pavia to Gabe Fisher, but Brady Cook answered for the Tigers on the next play, throwing a perfect 25-yard toss to Luther Burden II running open down the sideline.
The Tigers went three-and-out in the second overtime, when Craig hit his go-ahead 37-yarder. And when their defense held the Commodores, thanks in part to an offensive pass interference penalty, Taylor’s miss from 31 yards allowed them to escape.
“We’ve got a lot of work to do,” said Cook, who threw for 226 yards and two scores. “I think everybody knows we can be a lot better. We have to put ourselves in better situations. At the end of the day, we have to go and execute the game plan and score more points. That’s all.”

WHITESBURG, Ky. (AP) — Residents of a tiny Appalachian town struggled Friday to cope with a shooting involving two of its most prominent citizens: a judge who was gunned down in his courthouse chambers and a local sheriff charged with his murder.
“It’s just so sad. I just hate it,” said Mike Watts, the Letcher County circuit court clerk. “Both of them are friends of mine. I’ve worked with both of them for years.”
It wasn’t clear what led to the shooting. The preliminary investigation indicates Letcher County Sheriff Shawn “Mickey” Stines shot District Judge Kevin Mullins multiple times following an argument inside the courthouse, according to Kentucky State Police. 
Mullins, 54, who held the judgeship for 15 years, died at the scene, and Stines, 43, surrendered without incident. He was charged with one count of first-degree murder.
The fatal shooting stunned the tight-knit town of Whitesburg, the county seat, with a population of about 1,700 people, 145 miles (235 kilometers) southeast of Lexington. 
Stines was deposed on Monday in a lawsuit filed by two women, one of whom alleged that a deputy forced her to have sex inside Mullins’ chambers for six months in exchange for staying out of jail. The lawsuit accuses the sheriff of “deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train and supervise” the deputy.
The now-former deputy sheriff, Ben Fields, pleaded guilty to raping the female prisoner while she was on home incarceration. Fields was sentenced this year to six months in jail and then six and a half years on probation for rape, sodomy, perjury and tampering with a prisoner monitoring device, The Mountain Eagle reported. Three charges related to a second woman were dismissed because she is now dead.


Stines fired Fields, who succeeded him as Mullins’ bailiff, for “conduct unbecoming” after the lawsuit was filed in 2022, The Courier Journal reported at the time.
Those who know both the sheriff and the judge had nothing but praise for them, recalling how Mullins helped people with substance abuse disorder get treatment and how Stines led efforts to combat the opioid crisis. They worked together for years and were friends.
Those who knew Stines also were struggling to understand how someone they described as a family man could kill someone.
Jessica Slone, a distant relative of Stines’ and a lifelong resident of Letcher County, said she was shocked when she heard the news. She was at the dollar store with her nephew when he told her Mullins had been shot.
“I was like seriously? Is he okay? And he said ‘No, he’s dead,’” she said. “But at the time, I didn’t know that Mickey had done it. When I found out I was grocery shopping and I got really emotional and started praying.”
She said Stines was close with his children and worked hard to get fentanyl and methamphetamine off the streets of the community and help people dealing with substance use disorder get into recovery.
Patty Wood, the widow of District Judge Jim Wood, Mullins’ predecessor, said she has been close friends with Stines and his family for years. She said she was shocked by the shooting and the arrest of Stines.
“You couldn’t find a better person on the face of the earth than Mickey Stines. I don’t know what happened,” she said.
“I know Mickey’s character. And I know there had to be something that did it,” she said. “I just cannot believe that he just went in and shot him for no reason.”
Jennifer L. Taylor, a Whitesburg attorney, said Stines has a big heart and was looking forward to retiring from law enforcement, she said. In a recent conversation with her, Stines brought up that he might go to law school. Mullins, she said, “took his time out to listen to people.”
“Keep our community in prayers,” Taylor said. “It’s going to be a rough time.”
Several people also reflected on how a relatively quiet day in court quickly turned chaotic.
Watts said he saw Mullins and Stines together shortly before noon Thursday — about three hours before the shooting — when he went into the judge’s chambers to ask him to sign some papers. Mullins and Stines were getting ready to go out to lunch together, Watts said.
It seemed like an ordinary interaction, except that Stines seemed quieter than usual. He thought the pair had a good working relationship and knew of nothing that could have prompted the violent encounter. 
Watts, who was on another floor in the courthouse, never heard any shots and only learned of the shooting shooting when his son called to tell him there was an “active shooter” in the courthouse.
Taylor said she was at her law office a short distance from the courthouse, when the shooting happened Thursday. “We just saw cars flying by,” she said. “I’m still in shock. It’s unreal.”
Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said his office will collaborate with a regional commonwealth’s attorney as special prosecutors in the criminal case, since the lead county prosecutor, Matt Butler, recused himself and his office. Butler said he and the judge married two sisters, and their children act like siblings. 
“We will fully investigate and pursue justice,” Coleman said on social media.
Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Laurance B. VanMeter was in Whitesburg on Friday and said he was visiting to show his support for the community and “our Kentucky Court of Justice family,” he said. “They are obviously in shock and grieving.”
VanMeter commented on the swirl of social media speculation about what triggered the shooting.
“I know it’s hard to do, but I would hope that people on social media would just respect their privacy and their grief and let them mourn,” he said. “It’s just a tragic, horrific situation.”
Letcher County’s judge-executive closed the county courthouse on Friday.
It was unclear whether Stines had an attorney — state police referred inquires to a spokesperson who did not immediately respond by email.
Mullins served as a district judge in Letcher County since he was appointed by former Gov. Steve Beshear in 2009 and elected the following year.

NEW YORK (AP) — The company behind Tupperware, the plastic kitchenware that revolutionized food storage after World War II and became inextricably linked to the parties where women seeking a measure of financial independence and fun in midcentury America sold the colorful products, has filed for bankruptcy. 
Tupperware Brands, the Orlando, Florida-based consumer goods company that produces the iconic line of containers, said it was seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after struggling to revitalize its core business and failing to secure a tenable takeover offer. 
Despite enjoying the same cultural ubiquity as Kleenex, Teflon and other brands whose trademarked names are eponymous with entire product categories, Tupperware has suffered from waning sales, rising competition and the limitations of the direct-to-consumer marketing model that once defined its success. 
The company said Tuesday in its bankruptcy filing that consumers shifting away from direct sales, which make up the vast majority of its sales more than a quarter-century after the first Tupperware parties, has hit the storied business hard. 
The company also cited growing public health and environmental concerns about plastic, internal inefficiencies that made it challenging to operate globally, and the “challenging microeconomic environment” of the last several years for its financial straits.

Tupperware said it planned to continue operating during the bankruptcy proceedings and would seek court approval for a sale “in order to protect” the brand. 


Tupperware’s roots date to 1946. As the company tells it, chemist Earl Tupper found inspiration while creating molds at a plastics factory. He set out on a mission to create an airtight lid seal — similar to the one on a paint can — for a plastic container to help families save money on food waste.
The brand experienced explosive growth in the mid-20th century, particularly with the rise of direct sales through Tupperware parties. First held in 1948, the parties were promoted as a way for women to earn supplemental income by selling their friends and neighbors the lidded bowls for holding leftovers.
The system worked so well that Tupperware eventually removed its products from stores. It also led Tupper to appoint Brownie Wise, who came up with the house party idea, as a company executive, a position that was rare for a woman at the time. 
In the decades that followed, the brand expanded to include canisters, beakers, cake dishes and all manner of implements, and became a staple in kitchens across America and eventually, abroad as well. A newspaper reporter who went undercover to work as a footman in Buckingham Palace captured pictures of the royal Tupperware on the breakfast table of Queen Elizabeth II. 
The story behind the company also showed up on TV screens and on stage, with depictions in PBS’ 2004 film “Tupperware!” and the play “Sealed for Freshness.”
“For more than 70 years, Tupperware Brands has centered on a core purpose - to inspire women to cultivate the confidence they need to enrich their lives, nourish their families, and fuel communities around the world,” Tricia Stitzel, the company’s first female CEO, wrote as recently as 2018. “And we continue to make decisions, from our innovative products to our strategic growth strategy, which reflect this purpose.”
In the 2000s, Tupperware also diversified beyond its containers by acquiring beauty and personal care companies, most of them direct-selling brands like Avroy Shlain, Fuller Cosmetics, NaturCare, Nutrimetics and Nuvo.
Financial analysts, however, criticized Tupperware in recent years for sticking with the direct sales model and failing to evolve with the times, most notably the large number of women who work outside the home. 
“The reality is that the decline at Tupperware is not new,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in Wednesday commentary. “It is very difficult to see how the brand can get back to its glory days.”
The company’s sales improved some during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when Americans were cooking and eating more at home. But overall sales have been in steady decline over the years due to rising competition from Rubbermaid, OXO and even takeout food containers that consumers recycle. Vintage Tupperware also remains in demand as a collectible. 
Overall, sales for food storage supplies are up 18% compared to before the pandemic, according to figures from market research firm Circana. But despite that growth - and the ongoing popularity of food storage videos on social media - the troubles for Tupperware remained. 
Saunders explained that many consumers have migrated to less expensive home storage brands they can find at Target and Walmart. Amazon, the king of online retailers, also has its own line. 
Historically, Tupperware marketed its products as higher-quality durable items. But consumers who are looking for durability are interested in more sustainable materials, such as glass and stainless steel, said Jennifer Christ, manager of consumer and commercial research for the Freedonia Group, a market research company.
“There’s less brand loyalty than there used to be,” Christ said. 
In the past few years, Tupperware tried a few things to expand its reach and attract new customers. It started selling its products on Amazon as well as in stores at Target and Macy’s. In 2019, the brand also launched a line made with sustainable materials and expanded it two years later. 
But financial troubles continued to pile up. 
Last year, the company sought additional financing as it warned investors about its ability to stay in business and its risk of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.
The company received an additional non-compliance notice from the NYSE for failing to file its annual results with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. Tupperware continued to warn about its ability to stay afloat in more recent months, with an August securities filing pointing to “significant liquidity challenges.” 
Shares for the company have fallen 75% this year. 
In Tuesday’s bankruptcy petition, Tupperware reported more than $1.2 billion in total debts and $679.5 million in total assets. It said Tupperware currently employs more than 5,450 employees across 41 countries and partners with over 465,000 consultants who sell products on a freelance basis in nearly 70 countries. Particularly in India, Tupperware was introduced as a way for women to own their own businesses. 
Many Tupperware sellers market the products online, but many also make their sales during Tupperware parties at their homes or neighborhood gatherings. In the announcement of the filing, the company maintained that there were no current changes to Tupperware’s independent sales consultant agreements.
Tupperware also pointed to aims to “further advance Tupperware’s transformation into a digital-first, technology-led company,” possibly signaling a move toward increased reliance of sales on the brand’s website or perhaps more online-focused marketing, although the company did not provide exact specifics.
In a statement, Tupperware President and CEO Laurie Ann Goldman acknowledged Tupperware’s recent financial struggles and said that the bankruptcy process is meant to provide “essential flexibility” as the company pursues this transformation. The brand, she maintains, isn’t going anywhere.
“Whether you are a dedicated member of our Tupperware team, sell, cook with, or simply love our Tupperware products, you are a part of our Tupperware family,” Goldman said in a statement. “We plan to continue serving our valued customers with the high-quality products they love and trust throughout this process.”
The company’s bankruptcy filing, though, faces opposition from Tupperware’s new lenders, who want the petition dismissed or converted it to a Chapter 7 case, which would liquidate the company. Alternatively, they’re asking the court for permission to take action against the company, which could allow them to collect debt they’re owed.",False

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — No. 14 LSU’s game with surging South Alabama features one coach who played Louisiana high school football and grew up going to Tiger Stadium against a coach from Boston who didn’t move down South until he was 60 years old. 
Baton Rouge native Major Applewhite will be the visitor in his old home town, and the Jaguars first-year coach knows exactly what to expect when he faces Brian Kelly’s Tigers in Death Valley on Saturday night.
“Every Saturday that I could, I was over there in the south end zone watching every LSU game that I could,” Applewhite said, clarifying that he “didn’t grow up an LSU fan, but I pulled for LSU every time they weren’t playing Alabama.”
“I love Tiger Stadium. All my friends were LSU fans,” added Applewhite. “Loved growing up there. It was just a great experience.”
He’d like to add another positive memory of Death Valley this weekend. Although that will be a tall order, recent history shows he and South Alabama have a chance.
Applewhite, who played QB in college for Texas, was South Alabama’s offensive coordinator a year ago when they went to Oklahoma State and stunned the Cowboys, 33-7. 
During the past two weeks, the Jaguars (2-2) have scored a whopping 135 points against Northwestern State and Appalachian State combined.
“This will be a great challenge for us,” Kelly said, describing the Jaguars as “a team that’s coming in with nothing to lose, but certainly a team that is very capable in a lot of areas — very athletic, outstanding in terms of their schemes, well coached.”


LSU (3-1) is coming off a 34-17 victory over struggling UCLA in which the Tigers pulled away with a solid second half after a shaky first 30 minutes.
But the Tigers lost their biggest defensive star when Harold Perkins Jr. tore his right anterior cruciate ligament while making a tackle in the fourth quarter.
That’s the second prominent player on the Tigers’ defensive front to be lost for the season. Top defensive tackle Jacobian Guillory tore his Achilles in Week 2 against Nicholls State.
“Our players clearly understand in this game that that you’re going to get injuries,” Kelly said. “We’re not going to lose our identity or fall apart.”
LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier was named SEC offensive player of the Week after completing 32-of-44 passes for 352 yards and three TDs against UCLA.
Nussmeier produced with democratic distribution of the ball, completing passes to nine players. One was tight end Mason Taylor, who became LSU’s most productive receiving tight end in history (99 career catches for 999 yards).
“This year, it can go to anybody,” Kelly said. “You add the tight end into the mix as your leading receiver right now, it’s very difficult to defend us.”
South Alabama quarterback Gio Lopez has been productive passing and running, with 843 yards and nine TDs through the air to go with 171 yards and two TDs rushing.
At LSU, he’ll face a defense that has been prone to giving up big plays, including a 75-yard scoring run to South Carolina QB LaNorris Sellers two games ago.
Perkins’ absence will mean a shuffled lineup and different substitution patterns for LSU’s defense.
When the Tigers field three traditional linebackers, senior reserve West Weeks would take over in the middle while his younger brother, Whit, will play on the strong side with senior Greg Penn on the weak side, Kelly said.
In passing situations, LSU could remove a linebacker or two in favor of a defensive back and a hybrid “star” position player with the speed to cover receivers and the tackling ability to help against the run.
Perkins, an AP Preseason All-America selection, had the uncommon combination of size, strength and speed to effectively defend runs and passes. Kelly noted his roster doesn’t include any other players quite like him. 
LSU’s vertical passing game could get a boost this week with the expected return of receiver Chris Hilton, who has yet to play this season because of a bone bruise in his ankle.
“We need Chris Hilton back, and this seems to be the week,” Kelly said. “If we can add that vertical passing game, another element to it, I think it just makes it even better.”
The Tigers’ deep passing game got another boost last week from Kyle Parker, who made his first catch — a 45-yard TD —- since hurting his elbow in Week 1. 
“He made the play, and that was one of the worst (celebration) dances that I’ve ever seen,” Kelly said with a grin. “He looked like me dancing, so we’re going to work on that next.”

Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group slumped to their lowest level ever Friday, the first trading day that its biggest shareholder, former President Donald Trump, is free to sell his stake in the company behind the Truth Social platform.
Shares of Trump Media, commonly called TMTG, tumbled almost 8% to close at $13.55, putting the value of the company at less than $3 billion. Trump owns more than half of it. 
Trump and other insiders in the company have been unable to cash in on the highly volatile stock due standard lock-up agreements that prevent big stakeholders from selling stakes for a set period after a company becomes publicly traded. TMTG began trading publicly in March.
Trump owns nearly 115 million shares of the company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on TMTG’s share price early Friday, Trump’s holdings are worth, at least on paper, about $1.6 billion. It’s usually not in the best interest of big stakeholders to even attempt to sell large tranches of their stock because it could risk a broader sell-off.
Since going public, shares in Trump Media have gyrated wildly, often depending on news related to Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.
One week ago, the company’s shares jumped nearly 12% after Trump said he wouldn’t sell shares when the lock-up period lifted. The stock dipped more than 10% following the debate earlier this month between Trump and the Democrats’ nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. In mid-July, shares climbed more than 31% in the first day of trading following the first assassination attempt on Trump.


Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. is now worth considerably less than several months ago. When the company made its debut on the Nasdaq in March, the shares hit a high of $79.38. Friday’s closing price represents a decline of 83% from that peak.
Truth Social came into existence after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Based in Sarasota, Florida, Trump Media has been losing money and struggling to raise revenue. It lost nearly $58.2 million last year while generating only $4.1 million in revenue, according to regulatory filings.",False

Publication date:2024-09-21 07:00:00

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Pittsburgh Steelers placed rookie right tackle Troy Fautanu on injured reserve Saturday with a knee injury.
The 20th overall pick in the draft practiced most of the week before injuring the knee on Friday, less than 48 hours before the Steelers face the Los Angeles Chargers in a meeting of 2-0 teams. He was initially listed as questionable on the injury report before being downgraded to out Saturday morning. The team placed him on injured reserve later in the day.
Fautanu had been scheduled to make his second career start. The 23-year-old Washington product was slowed by a knee injury during training camp but impressed coach Mike Tomlin when he was cleared to return earlier this month.
The move to IR means Fautanu will miss at least four games, vaulting Broderick Jones back into a starting role. Jones, a first-round pick in 2023, was benched in favor of Fautanu last week against Denver. Jones struggled while getting a series of work early in the second quarter, being flagged for three penalties in just a handful of plays. He spent the rest of the game on the bench.
Earlier in the week, Tomlin said he had no plans to fully move on from Jones.
“I am sure (Jones) suffered some disappointment in terms of Troy starting,” Tomlin said. “It’s a natural thing. But he has to move past it and I have to give him an opportunity to move past it as a leader.”

COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Blake Craig made up for three missed field goals in regulation by hitting from 37 yards in the second overtime, and Vanderbilt kicker Brock Taylor missed a 31-yarder to keep the game going to allow No. 7 Missouri to escape with a 30-27 win in double-overtime Saturday night.
Brady Cook threw for 226 yards and two touchdowns and Nate Noel ran for 199 yards for Missouri. The Tigers (4-0, 1-0 SEC) avoided a big upset that would have been a blow to their College Football Playoff chances by beating the Commodores (2-2, 0-1) for the fifth straight time.
Diego Pavia had 178 yards passing and two TDs along with 84 yards rushing for Vanderbilt, which beat Virginia Tech in overtime to start the season.
Vanderbilt: The Commodores could easily be 4-0 this season. But they squandered a lead in the final minute of a 36-32 loss to Georgia State, then failed to capitalize on a series of mistakes by Missouri in a loss to the Tigers.
Missouri: The Tigers overcame a slew of mental mistakes and penalties for the second straight game. They trailed Boston College at halftime last week but similarly rallied in the second half for another close win to stay unbeaten on the season.
Missouri kicker Blake Craig missed field goals of 40 and 46 yards in the fourth quarter, either of which would have given the Tigers a 23-20 lead. Brock Taylor missed from 50 with just over three minutes that would have done the same for Vanderbilt. As a result, the Tigers and Commodores had to decide the game in overtime.


3 — That’s the number of field goal attempts Craig missed before hitting his eventual winner in double overtime.
Vanderbilt and Missouri are both off next week. The Commodores return to face No. 4 Alabama and the Tigers head to No. 25 Texas A&M on Oct. 5.

Publication date:2024-09-19 07:00:00

MILAN (AP) — Milan designers on Thursday challenged the notion that a collection should dictate how one dresses, offering instead individual looks that can elevate, transform or simply complement a wardrobe.
Prada led the charge with a collection that served as a review of its past, offering updated elements for the Prada woman to create her own power. A much newer Milan player, Maccapani, is making the mixing of the old and new the hallmark of the brand, now in its third season.
Some highlights from the third day of Milan Fashion Week of mostly womenswear previews for Spring-Summer 2025.
Call it the Prada Eras Tour. The Spring-Summer 2025 womenswear collection featured a review of Prada eras past, reinterpreted with a surreal, sometimes sci-fi eye.
“It was finding ways of being Prada today,” Miuccia Prada said backstage.
Prada, with her co-creative director Raf Simons, said the collection aims at finding humanity in an era when information overload is driven by algorithms. Instead of exploring themes on the runway, the designers created individual looks, playing up to the strengths of each character they created.
“We thought of each individual as a superhero, with their own power, their own story,’’ Simons said. In this scenario, clothes “can transform your own perception of yourself.’’
Prada’s human proposition becomes one of “infinite options,” unaided by Artificial Intelligence, to create your own power.


Skirts were suspended with rings from belts that fastened around the waist, giving 1990s Prada vibes. A-line treated leather skirts had a post-modern futuristic turn with circle cutouts. A leather sheath clanked with hardware. High-waist trousers featured a trompe-l’oeil belt, knitwear had two-dimensional collars. Ribbed leggings substituted trousers, belted or layered, under a transparent tulle skirt.
The designers’ superhero element was most literal in bug-eyed sunglasses and topless hats with tinted viewing panels.
Emporio Armani played with masculine codes for its new womenswear collection, revamping the necktie along the way.
A photograph projected behind the runway from a 2000 Guggenheim retrospective of designer Giorgio Armani’s first 25 years featured a woman dressed in a men’s suit and tie — underlining the tie’s enduring symbolism. Once a sign of gender equality, it “becomes a playful trend,” according to show notes.
A sequined tie was worn playfully as a bandeau top under a jacket for evening. Ties elegantly anchored daytime business suits, a belted tunic, or a dark evening suit jacket with sheer trousers.
Masculinity and femininity were balanced in soft jackets and flowing trousers, blousons and loose outerwear. A woven bootie was the footwear of choice. The color palette evolved from muted neutrals into bright hues, along with beads and sequins.
Titled Future Perfect, the collection was both a look back and a projection forward.
As he has recently, the 90-year-old Armani took his final bow with Leo Dell’Orco, head of design for menswear, and Silvana Armani, head of design for womenswear. He was also joined by two other long-time collaborators, Nicola Lamorgese, the head of design for Emporio Armani menswear, and Marco Brunello, head of design for womenswear. 
The new Max Mara collection takes shape through origami folds, which creative director Ian Griffiths made into a leitmotif.
The “humble dart,” as he called it, became a design feature, creating asymmetrical, draping dresses, or volumes on skirts, or a revival of a 1980s jacket tied at the side. The result was a clean wardrobe that belies the intricacy of the hand craftsmanship.
The Max Mara woman “likes to shock with the degree of precision in her look, how thought-through she is,” Griffiths said. “It is our job at Max Mara to make that easy to achieve.”
The collection in the brand’s trademark monochromes had an underlying sensuality, with bra tops, slits and cutouts offering a chance to reveal, while long jackets and hemlines afforded ample cover as desired. A crisp white shirt with folded cuffs was as integral to the looks as permanently crinkled fabrics, a leg-baring jacket-body suit combination as key as the trademark outerwear.
Joey King, whose latest film “Uglies” is streaming on Netflix, took front row wearing a gray cotton dress with a side cut-out.
Moschino creative director Adrian Appiolaza opened his latest collection with a blank canvas — a series of white gowns, twisted, tied and draped from crisp cotton, elaborated with ruffles, stitching and cutouts for folkloric flair.
The series was inspired by an image Appiolaza found in the archives of the late Franco Moschino draping a white sheet.
“It gave me this idea of freshness,” the designer said backstage. “Franco Moschino is always inspiring to me.”
In his third collection for the brand known for its irony, Appiolaza continued his exploration of trompe l’oeil, graphic prints and exaggerated proportions. The closing looks seemed to be caught between a little black dress, known in Italian as a tubino, and floral numbers, one worn on front, the other on back, posing the eternal dilemma: “Tubino or not to Tubino,” as written on the closing look.
Margherita Maccapani Missoni gave her new fashion baby her own, less-famous birth name, Maccapani, applying her fashion philosophy of mixing the old and new.
The Maccapani brand creates about 45 pieces a season, mostly out of versatile jersey — not just the familiar cotton version, but also jacquard and lurex. The brand aims to respond to the “needs of functionality and versatility that streetwear or athleisure respond to, but always feminine and elegant and put together,’' Maccapani Missoni said.
Her latest collection was shown in a Milan villa, with models engaged in leisure activities, putting together a puzzle, listening to music or drawing. One sang from the balcony. Missoni’s mother Angela, former creative director of the Missoni fashion house, wandered through.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Junior Bridgeman played for the Milwaukee Bucks long enough to retire as the team leader in games played and performed well enough that his jersey hangs from the Fiserv Forum rafters.
Now the basketball player-turned-entrepreneur has purchased a stake in the team.
The Bucks announced Bridgeman’s purchase in a news conference that included co-owner Jimmy Haslam, coach Doc Rivers, general manager Jon Horst and most of the team’s current players. Bridgeman said after the news conference he has a 10% stake in the team.
“The opportunity to get back involved with the team in a different way and take advantage of it was something that was kind of a dream,” Bridgeman said.
Bridgeman’s 711 career games played for Milwaukee ranks him third in franchise history, behind only current Bucks Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. His No. 2 jersey was retired by the Bucks in 1988.
He now joins a Bucks ownership group that includes Haslam and his wife Dee, Wes Edens, Jamie Dinan and Mike Fascitelli. Haslam praised the move by citing Bridgeman’s longstanding connections to Milwaukee and his success as a player and businessman as well as his character.
“If you said, ‘All right, let’s find somebody to add as a partner,’ he’s No. 1,” Haslam said. “And I can’t think who would be No. 2.”
Bridgeman’s ties to Milwaukee go back half a century.
After the Los Angeles Lakers selected Bridgeman out of Louisville with the eighth pick in the 1975 draft, they sent him to Milwaukee as part of the blockbuster trade that brought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the West Coast.


Bridgeman, 71, played for the Bucks from 1975-84 and then spent two years with the Los Angeles Clippers before coming back to Milwaukee for his final NBA season in 1986-87. He ranks seventh in Bucks history in field goals made (4,142), ninth in points (9,892) and 10th in minutes (18,054). 
Bridgeman has been even more successful off the floor.
After his playing career, Bridgeman began investing in restaurants and eventually became owner and CEO of Bridgeman Foods, which operated more than 450 Wendy’s and Chili’s restaurants in 20 states until 2016. He also has been an independent bottler for Coca-Cola. His family owns Ebony and Jet magazines.
Bridgeman’s success as a player and as a businessman made him attractive to NBA teams seeking people to purchase stakes in their team.
“I’d gotten at least three calls in the last three months from people wanting to know if (I’d) get involved with a team,” Bridgeman said. “I said, ‘I appreciate the opportunity, but no,’ because there’s no real connection. I know Boston’s for sale, and as many knock-down, drag-out battles as we had with Boston, I couldn’t see being an owner of the Boston Celtics, as great as they are. It had to mean more than just investing. It had to have some kind of heartfelt connection.”
The Bucks offered that connection.
“When you played here and you became a part of the Bucks organization, even when you left, you never felt like you were not a part of the organization,” Bridgeman said.
Bridgeman said he even had conversations with former Sen. Herb Kohl when he put the Bucks up for sale a decade ago.
“I talked to Sen. Kohl back then,” Bridgeman said. “It just didn’t feel right at that time. Now it does.”
Edens and Marc Lasry, both New York investment firm executives, bought the Bucks from Kohl for about $550 million in 2014 with pledges to keep the team in Milwaukee. Haslam bought Lasry’s 25% stake in the team last year.
Haslam said over the last year, a number of people who owned small percentages of the Bucks — a half-percent or 1% — wanted to tender their stocks. Those shares were purchased and then re-sold to Bridgeman.
Bridgeman hopes his new role helps him advise players on the right steps to take and the pitfalls they should avoid as they prepare for life after basketball. He’s had those types of discussions with players in the past.
“Nobody wants to see guys not be successful, or as successful as they could be,” Bridgeman said. “Maybe one day, they’ll be sitting up here, not being a 10% (owner) but buying the whole Milwaukee Bucks franchise. You never know.”

DEKALB, Ill. (AP) — Northern Illinois had just pulled off the stunner of the season at then-No. 5 Notre Dame two weeks ago and coach Thomas Hammock couldn’t hide his feelings.
His voiced cracked, his eyes welled up and the tears rolled down his cheeks. The sheer pride and joy and raw emotion was there on full display in a postgame interview that went viral by about the time he made it from the field to the locker room.
“You never can anticipate that type of moment,” Hammock, a former star running back in his sixth season leading his alma mater, said this week. “But it was the authentic me. And I always tell people you can only be you. Everybody else is taken. That’s who I am, that’s what I’m about, that’s what I believe, and I have a tremendous amount of pride for the people in our program.”
What a moment it is for the program.
The win over the Fighting Irish vaulted the Huskies (2-0) into the AP poll for the first time in 11 years at No. 25. They moved up to 23rd following a bye last week, and will try to build on their big win when they host Buffalo in their MAC opener on Saturday.
“A lot of good things have come from this and we’re more than grateful for those things, but we’ve still got a lot of football left to play,” cornerback JaVaughn Byrd said. “It’s still a long season.”
Northern Illinois is no stranger to winning football. The Huskies have consistently been among the top teams in the Mid-American Conference for two decades. They’ve played in 14 bowl games in that span, and the 2012 team even made the Orange Bowl, with star quarterback Jordan Lynch.


But the victory in South Bend, Ind., was unlike any other for NIU. Kanon Woodill hit a 35-yard field goal with 31 seconds to play, and Cade Haberman blocked a 62-yard try as time expired, preserving a 16-14 win.
The Huskies had never beaten a top-10 team, let alone one ranked in the top five, yet there they were doing it on one of college football’s hallowed grounds, in the shadow of Touchdown Jesus. For that matter, it had been nine years since they took out a ranked opponent, when they beat No. 20 Toledo 32-27 on Nov. 3, 2015, and their most recent nonconference win over Top 25 team was against No. 21 Alabama 21 years ago. NIU is now 7-34 against teams ranked in the AP poll after adding to its collection of “Boneyard Wins.”
What’s a “Boneyard Win?” The Huskies count “Boneyard Wins” as victories over power conference teams as well as top-tier independents Notre Dame and BYU in 2018. They have 19 since 1983 and have added three bones in the past four seasons.
“Obviously, it’s a statement win for any school,” said quarterback Ethan Hampton, who leads the nation in passing efficiency. “I don’t think just because we’re NIU and we go in there and beat a top-five team it’s a statement win because we’re NIU. You go to Big Ten teams, power-four teams they’re going to be psyched that they went to Notre Dame and beat them on their turf as well. But for us, our expectation is to win — plain and simple.”
Northern Illinois is often overshadowed in a major league market and a state with two Big Ten universities in Illinois and Northwestern. The school of approximately 16,000 sits about 55 miles west of downtown Chicago, in the hometown of model Cindy Crawford. NIU counts comedian Sebastian Maniscalco and actor Dan Castellaneta — the voice of Homer Simpson — among its notable alumni.
But the Huskies are having a moment, just as they did during that Orange Bowl season. Getting to this point hasn’t been easy.
Northern Illinois went 0-6 in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season — Hammock’s second. A year later, the Huskies won nine games and captured the MAC championship.
They’re obviously off to a good start this year with a veteran team. The Huskies have 32 seniors, including 20 who have spent their entire career at Northern Illinois, but keeping the roster largely intact was no sure thing.
Hammock and his staff had to fight off the bigger programs trying to poach players through the transfer portal. And they had to do it knowing NIU couldn’t compete when it came to the money.
“I knew how much the players loved this program,” Hammock said. “I treated them like men. I said ‘I’m going to support you no matter what you decide to do. But you know we love you guys. We want you here. We’ve built something special. And I think if you see it through, I think special things will happen for this football team.’”

PARIS (AP) — With his hair colored in a design reminiscent of the eyes in a Picasso painting, Team USA athletics captain Roderick Townsend was ready to go for a three-peat at the Paralympics.
“I’m a showman,” Townsend said, explaining the hairstyle he had done at a salon in Paris. “Had they been out there booing me? I’d probably still be jumping.”
Instead of booing, the Stade de France crowd followed Townsend’s every command, sitting quiet or cheering, as he won the T47 high jump finals on Sunday night, notching a 2.12-meter (6 feet, 11.5 inches) jump and collecting his third straight gold medal in the event. The T47 category is for competitors who have either lost part of an arm, or have low to moderate movement problems in one arm.
The 32-year-old Townsend, who has an upper right shoulder impairment after sustaining nerve damage at birth, considers himself the “bad guy,” going on a mission to be the “reason that nobody else gets to win.” He’ll get one more chance at that role Tuesday in the long jump. 
To win the high jump, Townsend had to outlast top competitor Nishad Kumar of India, who won silver in Tokyo Paralympics and finished second again in Paris. Kumar nearly reached the 2.12 mark in his three attempts, but clipped the bar each time. He lay in defeat on the high-jump mat for a long moment before Townsend came over to embrace him.
In that moment, Townsend, of Stockton, California, told Kumar that he’s “phenomenal” and he pushes Townsend to do great things because they are both so competitive. Townsend said following the race he has another goal in mind regarding Kumar: “I just want him to have as many silver medals as possible.”


After Townsend out-jumped Kumar, he went for more.
In the Tokyo games, Townsend broke the high jump record with a 2.15-meter jump before topping himself in the 2023 Paris World Championships with a 2.16-meter leap. This time, he was going for 2.17.
The crowd roared and clapped, but Townsend was ultimately unable to reset his record on Sunday, later revealing later he sustained a hernia while at the U.S. trials in July, and is still recovering.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — In its final years leading to the goodbye game for the Oakland Athletics, the Coliseum was known for its small crowds, run-down facilities and even the possums that populated the stadium.
But the last active stadium to serve as home for a Major League Baseball and NFL team at the same time has provided much more history ever since it opened in 1966 as the home of the Oakland Raiders.
The A’s arrived two years later, leading to an impressive run at the Coliseum that featured three World Series and four AFC or AFL title games played there in a 10-year span from 1967-76.
The Raiders left for good following the 2019 season and the A’s are headed out of town after this season, with their game Thursday game against the Texas Rangers the final one before they move to Sacramento for at least three years and then plan to go to Las Vegas.
Here’s a look at some of the numbers that defined the Coliseum.
1 — The first baseball game at the Coliseum was played on April 17, 1968. The Orioles beat the A’s 4-1 that day behind a two-hitter from Dave McNally. The first hit at the stadium was a solo homer by Boog Powell against Lew Krausse in the second inning.
3 — The number of AFC and AFL title games won by the Raiders at the Coliseum with them going to the Super Bowl after wins there in the 1967, 1976 and 2002 seasons. Oakland lost title games at home in 1969, 1974 and 2000.


6 — Titles won by the main tenants of the building with the A’s winning three straight World Series from 1972-74 and then again in 1989. The Raiders won Super Bowls in the 1976 and 1980 seasons when they called the Coliseum home.
12 — Games when teams allowed no hits to the opposition, trailing only Fenway Park (14) and Dodger Stadium (13) for the most no-hitters for any stadium. Nine of those games were individual no-hitters with the last being a perfect game by the Yankees’ Domingo German on June 28, 2023. Catfish Hunter (1968) and Dallas Braden (2010) also threw perfectos there for the A’s, making the Coliseum one of two stadiums to host three perfect games. The original Yankee Stadium also had three. 
17 — World Series games played at the Coliseum, including clinchers by the A’s in 1973 against the Mets and 1974 against the Dodgers. The A’s lost the final game of the Series at home in 1988 to the Dodgers and in 1990 to the Reds.
61 — The number of postseason games played at Coliseum, the fifth most of any stadium. Only Houston’s Minute Maid Park (64), Fenway Park (91), Dodger Stadium (105), and the original Yankee Stadium (161) have hosted more.
80 — The number of wins by Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter at the Coliseum, the most for any player. Hunter won 77 of those for the A’s and three more for the Yankees.
155 — The number of saves by Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley at the Coliseum, the most for any player.
166 — The number of home runs by Mark McGwire at the Coliseum, the most for any player. 
203 — The number of wins by the Texas Rangers at the Coliseum, the most for any visiting team.
.309 — Jason Giambi’s average at the Coliseum. Giambi is the only player with at least 750 plate appearances at the Coliseum to bat .300 or better. Two visiting players had better marks but both only had exactly 521 plate appearances: Ichiro Suzuki (.354) and Rod Carew (.314). 
310 — The number of NFL regular-season games played at the Coliseum by the Raiders. They won 178.
484 — The number of walk-off wins for the A’s at the Coliseum, the most for any team at any stadium since they moved to Oakland in 1968. 
895 — The number of hits Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson had at the Coliseum, the most for any player.
1,088 — The number of A’s who suited up for games at the Coliseum. Henderson played the most with 854 games there for Oakland and 32 more as a visitor.
2,492 — The number of regular season wins for the A’s at the Coliseum, the eighth most for any team at any stadium in baseball history.
4,493 — The number of regular-season baseball games played at the Coliseum, the 10th most at any stadium, according to Baseball Reference. The only active stadiums to host more games are Fenway Park, Wrigley Field, Dodger Stadium and Angel Stadium.
7,301 — The number of major professional sports games played at the Coliseum complex in the regular season and playoffs. The site was once home for four teams with the NBA’s Warriors and the Golden Seals of the NHL playing at the arena right next to the Coliseum. The breakdown of games is 4,454 for the A’s, 2,070 for the Warriors, 350 for the Golden Seals and 327 for the Raiders.

SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — Italy’s foreign minister Tuesday voiced strong support for Western Balkan countries’ European Union accession bids, saying that otherwise the region could swing towards Russia or China.
Speaking during a visit to North Macedonia, Antonio Tajani said the bloc should “lend a hand to those peoples who want to be with us Europeans.”
“If we don’t do that, there will be someone else who wants to replace us, I mean Russia, China and other parts of the world, I mean Turkey,” Tajani said.
He spoke during a press conference with his North Macedonian counterpart Timcho Mutsunski in the capital Skopje.
Tajani said Italy is “working and will work for North Macedonia to be an effective member of the European Union as soon as possible.”
North Macedonia and neighboring Albania have been candidates to join the EU since 2005. They launched membership negotiations with the block in 2022, in a process expected to take years.
The other Western Balkan countries seeking to join the EU are Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Kosovo.
Disputes with neighboring EU members have held up accession talks for North Macedonia. A decades-long spat with Greece over the use of the name Macedonia and the region’s ancient heritage was overcome in 2018.
But a newer dispute has emerged with Bulgaria, also centered on Balkan history, language and culture.
Following Bulgarian pressure, the EU has called on North Macedonia to change its constitution — inserting a reference to the existence of an ethnic Bulgarian minority — for the accession process to go ahead.


In exchange, Bulgaria would lift its objections to North Macedonia’s accession. 
The previous, center-left government in Skopje had agreed to make the constitutional change, but failed to secure the required majority on parliament. North Macedonia’s new conservative government strongly opposes the proposed change, and is doing all it can to delay it.",False

PRAGUE (AP) — The death toll was rising in Central European countries on Sunday after days of heavy rains caused widespread flooding and forced evacuations.
Several Central European nations have already been hit by severe flooding, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania. Slovakia and Hungary might come next as a result of a low pressure system from northern Italy dumping record rainfall in the region since Thursday.
The floods have claimed six lives in Romania and one each in Austria and Poland. In the Czech Republic, four people who were swept away by waters were missing, police said.

Most parts of the Czech Republic have been affected as authorities declared the highest flood warnings at around 100 places across the country. But the situation was worst in two northeastern regions that recorded the biggest rainfall in recent days, including the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border.
In the city of Opava, up to 10,000 people out of a population of around 56,000 have been asked to move to higher ground. Rescuers used boats to transport people to safety in a neighborhood flooded by the raging Opava River.
“There’s no reason to wait,” Mayor Tomáš Navrátil told Czech public radio. He said that the situation was worse than during the last devastating floods in 1997, known as the “flood of the century.”
“We have to focus on saving lives,” Prime Minister Petr Fiala told Czech public television on Sunday. His government was set to meet Monday to assess the damages.


The worst “is not behind us yet,” the prime minister warned.
President Petr Pavel sounded more optimistic, saying “it’s obvious we’ve learned a lesson from the previous crisis.”

Thousands of others also were evacuated in the towns of Krnov, which was almost completely flooded, and Cesky Tesin. The Oder River that flows to Poland was reaching extreme levels in the city of Ostrava and in Bohumin, prompting evacuations.
Ostrava, the regional capital, is the third-largest Czech city. Mayor Jan Dohnal said the city will face major traffic disruptions in the days to come. Almost no trains were operating in the region.
Towns and villages in the Jeseniky mountains, including the local center of Jesenik, were inundated and isolated by raging waters that turned roads into rivers. The military sent a helicopter to help with evacuations. 
Jesenik Mayor Zdenka Blistanova told Czech public television that several houses in her and other nearby towns have been destroyed by the floods. A number of bridges and roads have been badly damaged.
About 260,000 households were without power Sunday morning in the entire country, while traffic was halted on many roads, including the major D1 highway.
A firefighter died after “slipping on stairs” while pumping out a flooded basement in the town of Tulln, the head of the fire department of Lower Austria, Dietmar Fahrafellner, told reporters on Sunday.
Authorities declared the entire state of Lower Austria in the northeastern part of the country a disaster zone, while 10,000 relief forces have so far evacuated 1,100 houses there. Emergency personnel have started setting up accommodation for residents who had to flee their homes due to the flooding.
The municipality of Lilienfeld with about 25,000 residents is cut off from the outside world. Residents were told to boil tap water as a precaution. 
The situation is particularly dangerous along the Kamp River, which flows into the Danube. The Ottenstein reservoir on the river functions as a buffer, but exceeding its limits could cause more flooding, experts say. 
Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the situation “continues to worsen.” He said 2,400 soldiers were ready to support the relief effort in Austria. Of those, 1,000 soldiers will deploy to the disaster zone in Lower Austria, where dams were beginning to burst.
“We are experiencing difficult and dramatic hours in Lower Austria. For many people in Lower Austria these will probably be the most difficult hours of their lives,” said Johanna Mikl-Leitner, the governor of Lower Austria.
In Vienna, the Wien River overflowed its banks, flooding homes and forcing first evacuations of nearby houses. 
Romanian authorities said Sunday that another two people had died in the hard-hit eastern county of Galati after four were reported dead there a day earlier, following unprecedented rain.
In Poland, one person was presumed dead in floods in the southwest, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday. 
Tusk said the situation was “dramatic” around the town of Klodzko, with about 25,000 residents, located in a valley in the Sudetes mountains near the border with the Czech Republic. Helicopters were used to pick up people from roofs in a few cases.
In Glucholazy, rising waters overflowed a river embankment and flooded streets and houses. Mayor Paweł Szymkowicz said, “we are drowning,” and appealed to residents to evacuate to high ground. 
A bridge in the town collapsed under the flood pressure and a police station building was knocked down in Stronie Śląskie, after floodwaters burst through a dam. Submerged cars could be seen in many places in the Kłodzko Valley region bordering the Czech Republic, while a new flood wave was expected there.
In the city of Jelenia Gora, which has 75,000 residents, downtown streets were flooded after one of the embankments burst on the Bobr River. City authorities have warned residents they may need to evacuate as more flooding was moving toward the city.
Energy supplies and communications were cut off in some flooded areas, and regions may resort to using the satellite-based Starlink service, Tusk said.
The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just a year ago.
A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.

Third-year linebacker Baylon Spector is making his first career start and handling the on-field defensive play-calling duties in place of Terrel Bernard, who is sidelined by pectoral injury. Spector had a team-high-tying 10 tackles in playing 62 of 75 defensive snaps against Miami after Bernard was hurt. Spector is now part of a new linebacker tandem, playing alongside Dorian Williams, who began the season filling in for Matt Milano, who’s out until at least early December with a torn left biceps.
Josh Hines-Allen, who added Hines to his last name earlier this year to honor his maternal family, is 2-0 against his former namesake Josh Allen. Hines-Allen dominated the matchup in 2021, finishing with eight tackles, a sack, an interception and a fumble return in Jacksonville. He was mostly a non-factor in London last year, finishing with a solo tackle. Hines-Allen has six tackles, including a sack, this season.


Jaguars O-Line vs. Greg Rousseau and Von Miller. Jacksonville has already allowed seven sacks, including a safety. Rousseau had three sacks in a season-opening win over Arizona. And Miller has a sack in each outing after failing to have one in 14 games, including playoffs, while coming off a torn knee ligament last season.

Bills coach Sean McDermott has already ruled out Bernard and nickel cornerback Taron Johnson (right forearm) from playing. DE Dawuane Smoot (oblique) has resumed practicing and in line to make his Bills debut — against his former team, no less — after missing the first two games. ... The Jaguars don’t expect to have TE Evan Engram this week after he injured a hamstring during pregame warmups last Sunday. CB Tyson Campbell (hamstring) will miss his second straight game. 
The Jaguars have won four of the past six meetings, including two in London (2015 and last season). Jacksonville also has a 2-0 edge over Buffalo in the playoffs. The Jaguars defeated Buffalo 30-27 in the wild-card round in 1996, which marked Hall of Fame quarterback’s Jim Kelly’s final game. The Jags also beat Buffalo 10-3 in the wild-card round in the 2017 season —Sean McDermott’s first as coach in Buffalo. ... The Bills have won the past three meetings at Orchard Park, New York.
Four Jaguars players and coaches will be making a return to Buffalo: WR Gabe Davis, C Mitch Morse, special teams coordinator Heath Farwell and receivers coach Chad Hall. ... Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence is 2-0 against the Bills. He has eight TDs (five passing, three rushing) and no INTs with 96.3 QB rating in six career prime-time starts. ... RB Travis Etienne had a career-high 184 yards from scrimmage and two rushing TDs in the previous meeting against Buffalo. ... WR Brian Thomas ranks third among rookies with 141 yards receiving this season. ... TE Brenton Strange, filling in for Engram, had a career-high 65 yards receiving last week. DE Travon Walker aims for his fourth consecutive road game with a sack. ... The Bills seek a 3-0 start for the third time since McDermott took over as coach in 2017, after doing so in 2019 and 2020. ... Buffalo is 20-29 overall on “Monday Night Football”, and dropped both appearances last season — a 22-16 OT season-opening loss to the New York Jets and a 24-22 loss to Denver — with both outings decided on the final play. ... Bills QB Josh Allen has yet to throw an interception after totaling a career-worst 18 last season. He did lose a fumble in the season opener against Arizona, and has a record of 26-4 when not committing a turnover and 39-26 in games he does. ... Allen has topped 300 yards passing and with three or more touchdowns in four of seven appearances on Monday night. .... Buffalo’s 13 first downs against Miami was the team’s fewest since finishing with 12 in a 20-13 loss at Houston on Oct. 14, 2018, and fewest in a win since having 13 in beating the New York Jets 22-17 on Nov. 12, 2015. ... Buffalo has topped 100 yards rushing in 10 straight outings going back to last season, and is 13-2 when doing so since the start of 2023. ... RB James Cook matched a franchise record with three TDs in a half against Miami. ... Von Miller has a sack in each outing to increase his NFL active player-leading total to 125 1/2. He’s now tied with Dwight Freeney for 18th on the career list.
Allen and Cook have so far been the only consistent point-producers in a retooled Bills offense, which opened the season with an “everybody eats” mentality. Start both, while keeping Buffalo’s WRs and TEs on the bench in awaiting for a hierarchy to emerge.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers got mixed injury news on Friday, with star receiver Deebo Samuel practicing for a second straight day and All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams sitting out with a sore toe.
Samuel had been expected to miss “a couple” of games after injuring his calf in a Week 2 loss at Minnesota but made it back to practice on a limited basis this week and was listed as questionable for Sunday’s game against the New England Patriots.
Williams missed practice Friday after reporting that his toe was sore following the previous day’s practice and was also questionable for Sunday.
“It acted up a little bit in practice yesterday and it was just too sore for him to go today,” coach Kyle Shanahan said.
Tight end George Kittle had no injury designation for the game after missing last week’s game against the Rams with a hamstring injury.
Shanahan also said that All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey returned from Germany, where he went for treatment for the Achilles tendinitis that led to him being placed on injured reserve two weeks ago.
McCaffrey will have to miss at least least two more games before he will be able to return to practice but Shanahan said he expected his rehab to ramp up beginning next week.
There were two other injuries from Thursday’s practice with safety Talanoa Hufanga rolling his ankle and linebacker Curtis Robinson tearing his ACL. Hufanga will be listed as questionable this week and Robinson is out for the rest of the season.
Linebacker Dee Winters (ankle) and defensive lineman Jordan Elliott (foot) were also questionable.

TOKYO (AP) — Global shares were mixed in cautious trading Monday ahead of the Labor Day holiday in the U.S., when stock exchanges are closed.
France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.3% in early trading to 7,611.64, while Germany’s DAX fell 0.1% to 18,881.14. Britain’s FTSE 100 was little changed, down less than 0.1% at 8,370.39. U.S. shares were set to drift lower with Dow futures down 0.1% at 41,613.00. S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% to 5,654.25. 
Investors were also looking ahead to the U.S. employment report set for release Friday for an indication of the strength of the American economy.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.1% to finish at 38,700.87, after the Finance Ministry reported capital spending by Japanese companies in the April-June quarter increased 7.4% from the previous year.
After a period of stagnation, Japan’s economy is showing signs of a recovery. Next week, Japan will release revised gross domestic product, or GDP, data, a measure of the value of a nation’s goods and services. The preliminary data released earlier showed the first growth in two quarters.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.2% to 8,109.90, while South Korea’s Kospi gained nearly 0.3% to 2,681.00. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.7% to 17,691.97. The Shanghai Composite dipped 1.1% to 2,811.04.
A bit of pessimism rolled in over China’s growth prospects over the weekend, as its National Bureau of Statistics reported that August manufacturing PMI, a barometer of industrial output, fell from 49.4 to 49.1. That was weaker than market forecasts.


Recent reports on the U.S. economy, including inflation, consumer spending and income, have been encouraging. The Commerce Department said its personal consumption and expenditures report showed prices rose 0.2% from June to July, up slightly from the previous month’s 0.1% increase.
That means price rises are slowing down, and that’s likely to lead to the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates for the first time in more than four years. The market expects the Fed will start cutting rates later this month.
In other encouraging news, Friday’s Commerce Department report showed Americans stepped up their spending by 0.5% from June to July and incomes rose 0.3%, faster in July than the previous month.
In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 5 cents to $73.60 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 6 cents to $76.99 a barrel.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 146.68 Japanese yen from 146.18 yen. The euro cost $1.1071, up from $1.1053.

Publication date:2024-09-19 07:00:00

CHICAGO (AP) — Taylor Hall said he woke up Thursday morning with a smile on his face.
For good reason.
Hall hit the ice with the Chicago Blackhawks for the first practice of training camp after he missed most of last season because of right knee surgery. It was an active offseason for Chicago in free agency, but Hall’s return might be the most important development for the rebuilding franchise.
“I’ve been through a long road of recovery and watched a lot of hockey and watched a lot of practices,” Hall said, “so for me to go out and play and join my teammates, there’s nothing more special for me. I feel like I have a better appreciation for what I do for a living now after being out for so long.”
Chicago acquired Hall and Nick Foligno in a June 2023 trade with Boston. The Blackhawks were about to select Connor Bedard with the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, and the pair of veteran forwards were brought in to provide more leadership and scoring alongside the young center.
But Hall never got going in his first season with the team.
First, he was sidelined by a left shoulder injury. In his third game after he came back, Hall hurt his right knee when he was hit by Tampa Bay’s Michael Eyssimont on Nov. 9. He tried to play through it, but ended up exacerbating the injury in practice, leading to his season-ending ACL surgery.
Hall, who turns 33 in November, totaled two goals and two assists in a career-low 10 games. All he could do is watch as Chicago struggled to score on its way to a 23-53-6 record and a last-place finish in the Central Division.


Hall said he is “100% healthy” as training camp ramps up this year.
“I don’t have any limitations in the gym or on the ice,” he said. “It’s more about just getting my brain up to game speed and playing hockey again.”
The only upside to the injuries for Hall was a chance to spend more time with his first child with his wife, Rachel — a son who was born in October.
“I was devastated to know that I was going to miss the whole season, obviously, but it did provide me some more family time,” Hall said, “some time with my son that I would never have had. It was a huge negative overall, but I tried to take some positives from it.”
If Hall can regain his previous form, he could provide a big lift for Chicago as it looks to become a more competitive team. He played alongside Bedard and Tyler Bertuzzi during a camp-opening scrimmage. He likely will play on a wing on one of the team’s top two lines this season.
Hall, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 draft, has 266 goals and 431 assists in 14 years in the NHL, also playing for Edmonton, New Jersey, Boston, Arizona and Buffalo. He has eight seasons with at least 50 points.
He set career highs with 39 goals and 54 assists for the Devils during the 2017-18 season, winning the Hart Trophy as NHL MVP.
“I’m excited. That’s my role,” Hall said of his scoring ability. “That’s what I’ve done for a long time in this league, and I know what I can bring to a team.”
Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson described Hall as “so revved up to play right now.”
“He’s all business right now, just the way we want to conduct ourselves as a team,” Richardson said, “and he’s driving that pace out there. That’s the way he likes to play. I remember him in New Jersey being an MVP of the league, and that’s the way he played.”

DETROIT (AP) — Jeep is recalling more than 194,000 plug-in hybrid SUVs worldwide because they can catch fire with the ignition turned off.
In addition, Jeep is urging owners not to charge the SUVs and to park them outdoors and away from structures until they are repaired. 
The recall covers the Wrangler four by e from the 2020 through 2024 model years, as well as the Grand Cherokee four by e from 2022 through 2024. Most of the recalled SUVs are in North America.
Stellantis, which makes Jeeps, said a remedy is near and affected customers will be notified when they can schedule service. The company says the risk of fire is reduced when the battery charge is depleted.
A routine review of customer data led to an investigation that found 13 fires with two injuries. Stellantis estimates that 5% of the SUVs have the problem.

WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Rev. Lee Scott publicly endorsed Kamala Harris for president during the Evangelicals for Harris Zoom call on Aug. 14, the Presbyterian pastor and farmer said he was taking a risk. 
“The easy thing for us to do this year would be to keep our heads down, go to the ballot box, keep our vote secret and go about our business,” Scott told the group, which garnered roughly 3,200 viewers according to organizers. “But at this time, I just can’t do that.”
Scott lives in Butler, Pennsylvania, the same town where a would-be assassin shot former President Donald Trump in July. Scott told The Associated Press that the attack and its impact on his community pushed him to speak out against Trump and the “vitriol” and “acceptable violence” he normalized in politics.
Trump has maintained strong support among white evangelical voters. According to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 white evangelical voters cast a ballot for him in 2020. But a small and diverse coalition of evangelicals is looking to pull their fellow believers away from the former president’s fold, offering not only an alternate candidate to support but an alternate vision for their faith altogether.
“I am tired of watching meanness, bigotry and recreational cruelty be the worldly witness of our faith,” Scott said on the call. “I want transformation, and transformation is risky business.”
Trump has heavily courted white conservative evangelicals since his arrival on the political scene almost a decade ago. Now he is selling Trump-themed Bibles, touting the overturning of Roe v. Wade and imploring Christians to get out the vote for him. 


But some evangelicals have used perceived cracks in his political fidelity to further distance themselves from the former president, especially as Trump and his surrogates have waffled over whether he would sign a federal abortion ban  should he become president.
The Rev. Dwight McKissic, a Baptist pastor from Texas who spoke on the Evangelicals for Harris call, said he saw no “moral superiority of one party over the other,” citing the GOP’s decision to “abandon a commitment to ban abortion with a constitutional amendment” and to soften its stance against same-sex marriage in its party platform.
Though he has historically voted Republican, McKissic said he would vote for Harris, whom he said has stronger character and qualifications. 
“I certainly don’t agree with her on all matters of policy,” said Scott, who identifies as evangelical and is ordained in the mainline Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). “I am pro-life. I am against abortion. But at the same time, she has a pro-family platform,” citing Harris’ education policies and promise to expand the child tax credit.
Grassroots groups like Evangelicals for Harris are hoping they can convince evangelicals who feel similarly to support Harris instead of voting for Trump or sitting out the election altogether.
With modest funding in 2020, the group, formerly known as Evangelicals for Biden, targeted evangelical voters in swing states. This election, the Rev. Jim Ball, the organization’s president, said they’re expanding the operation and looking to spend a million dollars on targeted advertisements.
While white evangelicals vote strongly Republican, not all evangelicals are a lock for the GOP, and in a tight race, every vote counts.
What to know about the 2024 Election
In 2020, Biden won about 2 in 10 white evangelical voters, but performed better with evangelicals overall, according to AP VoteCast, winning about one-third of this group. A September AP-NORC poll found that around 6 in 10 Americans who identify as “born-again” or “evangelical” have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Harris, but around one-third have a favorable opinion of her. The majority — around 8 in 10 — of white evangelicals have a negative view of Harris.
Vote Common Good, a similar group run by progressive evangelical pastor Doug Pagitt, has a simple message: Political identity and religious identity are not a package deal.
″There’s a whole group who have become very uncomfortable voting for Trump,” Pagitt said. “We’re not trying to get them to change their mind. We’re trying to work with them once their minds have changed to act on that change.”
In August, Harris’ campaign hired the Rev. Jen Butler, a Presbyterian (U.S.A.) minister and experienced faith-based organizer, to lead its religious outreach.
Butler told the AP she has been in touch with Evangelicals for Harris. With less than two months until Election Day, she wants to harness the power of grassroots groups to quickly engage even more faith voters. 
“We want to turn out our base, and we think we have some real potential here to reach folks who have voted Republican in the past,” Butler said. 
They are focusing on Black Protestants and Latino evangelicals, especially in key swing states. They are reaching out to Catholics and mainline Protestants across the Rust Belt and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Arizona and Nevada. Butler’s colleagues are working with Jewish and Muslim constituencies. 
Catholics for Harris and Interfaith for Harris groups are launching. Mainline Protestant groups like Black Church PAC and Christians for Kamala are also campaigning on behalf of the vice president.
Butler, who grew up evangelical in Georgia, said the Harris campaign can find common ground with evangelicals, particularly suburban evangelical women. 
“There’s a whole range of issues that they care about,” she said, citing compassionate approaches to immigration and abortion. “They know that the way to address any pro-life concerns is really to support women.” 
Even for evangelicals who dislike Trump, it can be difficult to support a Democrat. 
Russell Jeung, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and speaker on the Evangelicals for Harris call, told AP that the group doesn’t “agree with everything that Harris stands for” and that evangelicals can “hold the party accountable by being involved.”
Others on the call noted they would use their vote to pressure Harris on issues where they disagreed, with Latina evangelical activist Sandra Maria Van Opstal saying she’d push the potential Harris administration “to do better on Palestine-Israel and do better on immigration.”
Soong-Chan Rah, a professor of evangelism at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, describes himself as a nonpartisan progressive evangelical and a “prophet speaking to broken systems.” Though he’s never endorsed a candidate before, he said the stakes of this election are so high that he wanted to throw his public support behind Harris.
“Not only do I find this candidate, Trump, repugnant and repulsive,” Rah said, “it is to such an extreme that I want to endorse his opposition.”
But the chorus of evangelicals who find voting for a Democrat unconscionable remains loud.
Trump-supporting evangelical worship leader Sean Feucht ridiculed the existence of Evangelicals for Harris on X: “HERETICS FOR HARRIS rings so much truer!”
The Rev. Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump supporter, took issue with one of the group’s ads and its use of footage of his late father, the Rev. Billy Graham. “The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris,” he wrote on his public Facebook page, which has 10 million followers.
But the project of shoring up Democratic evangelical voters goes beyond partisan politics. It gets at the core of what evangelicalism means.
The term evangelical itself is fraught and has become synonymous with the Republican Party, argues Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University.
“More people are probably evangelical theologically,” said Burge, “but they’re not going to grab that word because they don’t vote for Trump or they’re moderate or liberal.”
Evangelicalism has historically referenced Christians who hold conservative theological beliefs regarding issues like the importance of the Bible and being born again. But that’s changed as the term has grown more connected with Republican voters.
For many, evangelicalism has largely been defined along racial and socio-political lines and in endorsing Harris, Rah hopes to “show that there are other voices in the church aside from the religious right and Trump evangelicals.”
Latasha Morrison, a speaker on the Evangelicals for Harris Zoom, told the AP that as a Black woman, “I never associated myself with the word ‘evangelical’ until I started attending predominantly white churches.”
For years her anti-abortion views led her to vote Republican, but now the Christian author and diversity trainer says, “I feel like women and children have a better opportunity under the Harris administration than the Trump administration.”
For Ball, the Evangelicals for Harris organizer, he’s not looking to “tell people if they are an evangelical” or not.
“Diversity is a strength for us. We’re not looking for total unanimity. We’re looking for unity,” Ball said. “We can be united while we still have differences.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Liberty have been focused on bringing the first championship to the franchise after falling just short last year.
They moved one step closer to that goal as Sabrina Ionescu tied a franchise playoff record with 36 points to help the Liberty beat the Atlanta Dream 91-82 on Tuesday night and advance to the semifinals of the WNBA playoffs.
“The ultimate goal is what it is. But, you know, it’s every single game is a championship game to get to that final goal,” Ionescu said. “And obviously our goal is to not lose at home. So this was really important for us to come out, take these two and have a couple days off and kind of rest, recharge and get ready for whatever it is we’re going to play.” 
Jonquel Jones added 20 points and 13 rebounds for the top-seeded Liberty, who swept the best-of-three series and will face Las Vegas in the next round that begins Sunday in New York. The Aces beat the Liberty in the WNBA Finals last season.
“We have unfinished business,” Jones said.
The Liberty took a one-point lead into the fourth quarter and the teams went back and forth before a layup by Courtney Vandersloot made it 75-72 with 5:41 left and started a 12-2 run. Breanna Stewart followed later in the spurt by swooping in for an offensive tip-in. It was her first points since the second quarter.
Leonie Fiebich, who scored 21 points in the opening game, then had a three-point play to extend the advantage to 82-74 with 4:11 left. She then hit a 3-pointer on the next possession to give New York a double-digit advantage for the first time in the game. 


“It had a little bit of everything,” Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said of the run.
Atlanta couldn’t get closer than seven the rest of the way.
“I don’t think it was anything they did different,” Rhyne Howard said of New York’s stretch run. “We fought pretty hard, laid it out there. Coach told us to not go home with any regrets and we did that.”
Allisha Gray and Howard did all they could to try and stave off elimination. Gray finished with 26 points and Howard added 19. She also had a massive block on Stewart on a fast break in the third quarter.
“We watched it four or five times before we came in here (to the postgame presser),” Howard said smiling.
Stewart was impressed with the play by Howard
“She timed it really well,” the Liberty star said. “She got the block. I got the win.”
Unlike Game 1, when New York jumped all over Atlanta, the Dream got off to a quick start behind Gray. They led 28-19 as Gray had 14 points in the opening 10 minutes, hitting all five of her shots, including four 3-pointers. 
Atlanta was up 11 in the second quarter before Ionescu started hitting deep 3s. She rallied the Liberty to take a brief 40-36 lead before the Dream closed the half on a 12-3 run to go up 48-43 at the break. 
Ionescu tied Cappie Pondexter for the most points by a Liberty player in the postseason. Pondexter set the mark in 2010 also against the Dream.
“I guess I should have had one more,” Ionescu said, laughing.
The game drew another sellout crowd for New York that included Olympian Gabby Thomas, singer Pharrell as well as Spike Lee and Whoopi Goldberg. Rapper Ja Rule performed at halftime.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Philadelphia 76ers have a new teammate in their bid to build a new $1.3 billion arena downtown.
Mayor Cherelle Parker announced Wednesday that she has forged a deal with team owners to keep the NBA franchise in town and will send it to city council. The decision comes despite objections from nearby Chinatown residents and just weeks after New Jersey’s governor offered $400 million in tax breaks to build the site across the river in Camden. 
“This is an historic agreement,” Parker said in a video posted on the social platform X. “I wholeheartedly believe this is the right deal for the people of Philadelphia. To the people of Chinatown, please know that I hear you. We have the best Chinatown in the United States, and I am committed to working together to support it.”
Team owners say their planned 76 Place would improve a struggling retail corridor near City Hall and capitalize on the city’s public transit. They have vowed not to renew the lease on their current home, a circa 1996 arena in the city’s South Philadelphia sports complex, when their lease runs out in 2031. 
The team now rents the arena from Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also play there. Instead, the Sixers’ owners want their own, more modern facility, one they could also rent out for concerts and other events.
Josh Harris, a managing partner of the ownership group, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, has said the Sixers will build a privately funded facility that “strengthens ties within the local community through investments that prioritize equity, inclusivity and accessibility.”


On Wednesday, a spokesperson said the owners were grateful for Parker’s support of their proposal “and look forward to advancing to the next steps with city council.”
Chinatown activists who have felt the squeeze of development repeatedly since at least the 1990s had urged the mayor to reject the plan. They are only now getting some relief from a sunken expressway that cleaved their community in two in 1991, in the form of a $159 million grant to build a park over the six-lane highway and reconnect the area.
Parker, who inherited the 76ers issue when she took office in January, had promised to consider their input. Activists complained Wednesday that she ignored it. Some of them took to City Hall with homemade lanterns to “shine a light” on the potential consequences. They say the project will increase vehicle traffic in their pedestrian-friendly neighborhood and force vulnerable residents — older people, low-income families and new immigrants — out.
Debbie Wei, of the Save Chinatown Coalition, said the mayor alone should not decide “whether our community should live or die.”
“This fight is far from over,” she said in a statement. “We are going to fight this, and we are going to the mat. It’s on.”
Comcast Spectacor Chairman and CEO Daniel J. Hilferty said they will keep the door open for the 76ers as the plan unfolds while working with the Phillies to expand entertainment venues and jobs at the South Philadelphia complex.
“Either way, we always want what is best for Philadelphia,” Hilferty said in a statement.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — New York Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns finds himself in an unusual situation this weekend as he returns to American Family Field for the first time since leaving the Milwaukee Brewers.
His current team is trying to clinch a postseason berth by beating the annual playoff contender he helped build.
“I think at this point I have enough distance for it,” Stearns said before the Mets’ 8-4 loss to the Brewers on Friday night. “That roster has turned over pretty considerably since I’ve been in the seat here. I certainly know a lot of the people over there, I know a lot of the players over there, but I think there’s been enough distance at this point.”
Stearns joined the Brewers in October 2015 as general manager and was promoted to president of baseball operations before the 2019 season. He stepped down after the 2022 season and remained with the Brewers in an advisory role while Matt Arnold — his former right-hand man — took over as president of baseball operations. Stearns left Milwaukee entirely last fall to run baseball operations for the team he rooted for as a kid growing up in New York City.
He believed this was his first time back at American Family Field since August 2023. The Brewers opened the season by sweeping the Mets in New York, but the teams hadn’t faced each other since.
Now they’re meeting again with the Mets’ season on the line.


The Mets are competing with the Atlanta Braves and Arizona Diamondbacks for the NL’s final two wild-card spots. The Mets’ loss and the Braves’ 3-0 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Friday left them with identical 87-71 records. The Diamondbacks fell to 88-72 with their 5-3 loss to the San Diego Padres.
As Stearns noted, the Brewers’ roster has changed quite a bit since he departed. Milwaukee’s starting lineup Friday included only four players — second baseman Brice Turang, right fielder Sal Frelick, left fielder Jackson Chourio and shortstop Willy Adames — who joined the organization when Stearns was in charge.
Even so, Stearns played a major role in helping the Brewers put together the longest sustained run of success in franchise history. Milwaukee clinched the NL Central title last week and will be making its sixth playoff appearance in the last seven years. That run of postseason bids came shortly after Stearns engineered the blockbuster acquisition of Christian Yelich, the 2018 NL MVP.
Milwaukee had made the playoffs just twice in a 35-year stretch from 1983-2017.
“It’s fun being back here,” Stearns said. “I’m glad I’m back here when games really matter for us. We’re playing for something that’s really important, so we have to go out and have a good series.”
Stearns is now trying to get back in the playoffs with the Mets, which could result in a return to Milwaukee next month. But that path just got quite a bit more complicated.
The Mets face the possibility of playing a doubleheader in Atlanta on Monday — the day after the scheduled end of the regular season — for the right to begin a Wild Card Series on Tuesday. That scenario developed because New York’s scheduled Wednesday and Thursday games in Atlanta were rained out.
“Nobody wants to play a doubleheader on Monday,” Stearns said. “The Braves didn’t want that outcome, MLB didn’t want that outcome and certainly we didn’t want that outcome. I think it’s easy in retrospect to say that we could have done things differently to get there. It’s also really tough in the moment to predict exactly what the weather is going to do. There are a whole host of considerations that everyone is working through in order to make the best decision possible. 
“The reality is we may have to play a doubleheader on Monday, and if we do, we’ll do the best that we can.”
Stearns was asked if he believed the start of a Wild Card Series should be pushed back a day if that Monday doubleheader takes place. The twinbill would only happen if the Mets’ and Braves’ playoff fates aren’t settled by then.
“That’s not my decision, and so I’m not really thinking about it,” Stearns said. “Whenever we play, we play.”
If New York ends up as the third NL wild card, Stearns would be seeing his former team again with even more at stake as the Mets and Brewers square off in a best-of-three series.
“Our focus is on to get into the playoffs,” Stearns said. “If we get into the playoffs, we’ll play whoever we need to play.”

KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Authorities in Congo said that 50,000 doses of mpox vaccine from the United States arrived in the country on Tuesday, a week after the first batch arrived from the European Union.
Adults in Equateur, South Kivu and Sankuru, the three most affected provinces, will be vaccinated first, starting on Oct. 2, Cris Kacita Osako, coordinator of Congo’s Monkeypox Response Committee, told The Associated Press. 
Last week, the first batch of mpox vaccines arrived in the capital of Congo, the center of the outbreak. The 100,000 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine, manufactured by the Danish company Bavarian Nordic, were donated by the EU through HERA, the bloc’s agency for health emergencies. Another 100,000 were delivered over the weekend.
The 50,000 doses from the U.S. will be of the same JYNNEOS vaccine.
The 250,000 doses are just a fraction of the 3 million doses authorities have said are needed to end the mpox outbreaks in Congo, the epicenter of the global health emergency. EU countries pledged to donate more than 500,000 others, but the timeline for their delivery remained unclear. 
Since the start of 2024, there have been 5,549 confirmed mpox cases across the continent, with 643 associated deaths, representing a sharp escalation in both infections and fatalities compared to previous years. The cases in Congo constituted 91% of the total number. Most mpox infections in Congo and Burundi, the second most affected country, are in children under age 15.
Last week, the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization launched a continent-wide response plan to the outbreak of mpox, three weeks after WHO declared outbreaks in 12 African countries a global emergency.


Congo issued an emergency approval of the vaccine, which has already been used in Europe and the United States in adults. For the moment, the rollout will be reserved for adults, with priority targeted groups being those who have been in close contact with infected people and sex workers, the Africa CDC Director-General Dr. Jean Kaseya told reporters last week.
The European Medicines Agency is examining additional data to be able to administer it to children ranging in age from 12 to 17, which could happen at the end of the month, HERA Director-General Laurent Muschel said.
The next batch of mpox vaccines will come from Japan and could arrive as early as this weekend, Kacita Osako told the AP, without specifying how many doses.",False

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court on Monday upheld a lower court ruling that rejected a bid to get independent presidential candidate Cornel West on the ballot for the November election in the battleground state.
The courts sided with the secretary of state’s office under Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro in rejecting West’s candidacy paperwork. The decision also sets in motion the process for counties to start printing, testing and sending out mail-in ballots to voters who requested one ahead of the Nov. 5 election.
Within hours of the court’s decision, Secretary of State Al Schmidt certified the ballot for counties.
“Counties can now prepare their ballots to be printed, then begin sending mail ballots to voters who have requested one as soon as they are printed,” Schmidt said in a statement.
The court case had been among a raft of partisan legal maneuvering around third-party candidates, as backers of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris had aimed to derail third-party candidates who might siphon away support — or to help others who might hurt their opponent.
In an unsigned one-page order, the state Supreme Court said it had affirmed the lower Commonwealth Court decision. In it, the court had agreed with Schmidt’s office that West’s campaign lacked the required affidavits for 14 of West’s 19 presidential electors.
The deadline to submit them was Aug. 1.


Now, Trump and Harris will appear on Pennsylvania’s ballot with the Green Party’s Jill Stein and the Libertarian Party’s Chase Oliver. Stein and Oliver submitted petitions to get on Pennsylvania’s presidential ballot without being challenged.
The Nov. 5 election is expected to be close in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes are tied with Illinois for fifth-most, and arguably are the most awarded by any battleground state.
Counties, which typically send out mail-in ballots weeks before the election to voters who request them, have been waiting for the court to rule on the final ballot-access cases. Now that it has, county election officials say they will need time to test, print and mail the ballots.
That process could drag into October, depending on the county.
Under state law, counties must start delivering or mailing the official mail-in ballots to voters who applied for one as soon as a ballot is certified and available.
Counties may also have mail-in ballots available earlier for over-the-counter service for voters who come into a county election office and apply for a ballot in person. 
The deadline for counties to receive a completed mail-in ballot is when polls close, by law, at 8 p.m. on Election Day. The deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot is Oct. 29, one week before the Nov. 5 election.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — No more having to twist around the reality of that playoff debacle to talk about what had been an NFL-best 16-game home win streak for the Dallas Cowboys.
That is over after another impressive in-game streak by the New Orleans Saints. 
Loud chants of “Who Dat?” from visiting fans echoed loudly and got more frequent during the home opener for the Cowboys, who lost 44-19 after New Orleans scored touchdowns on its first six possessions on Sunday.
It was another dud at AT&T Stadium for the Cowboys (1-1) when expectations were so high.
Coming off a dominating season-opening win at Cleveland and with Dak Prescott playing his first game since signing a $240 million, four-year contract. the Cowboys instead lost again eight months after their previous home game — when they fell behind 27-0 in the first half in a wild-card loss to Green Bay. They trailed the Saints 35-16 at the break.
“I’m not comparing last year to this year. We’re talking two completely different teams honestly,” Prescott said. “Talking a whole different defensive coordinator. You’re talking new players in different positions, particularly on offense.”
And now talking about another big disappointment, though there is still plenty of season left to play this year. 
“Got to reset, and we’ve got to respond. ... We’re not going undefeated. It hasn’t been done in 50 years, what a surprise,” Prescott said. 


“We’ve got so much ahead of us,” said owner Jerry Jones, who insisted that he really didn’t have any flashbacks to that 48-32 loss to the Packers. “We’ve got a lot of work to do. We’ve got a lot of good players that can do the work. I’m confident we’ll get it done. We’ll learn from this.”

Prescott finished 27-of-39 passing for 293 yards and a touchdown with two interceptions. He was sacked three times.
Dallas is the only team other than New England since 2000 to have a 16-game home win streak — the Patriots had four in that span. The Cowboys, whose previous regular-season loss at AT&T Stadium was the 2022 opener against Tampa Bay, came up short of their franchise-record 18 consecutive home wins from 1979-81.
Chicago now has the NFL’s longest home win streak at six in a row. The Bears’ next game at Soldier Field is in two weeks.
The Cowboys are back home next Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens. 
“I wouldn’t say I’m concerned right now just because it’s so early in the year. We can do so much better,” defensive end Micah Parsons said. “We didn’t do our job to our best of our standard, and the standard wasn’t held today.”
After scoring on their first nine possessions in their season opener, the Saints already had 310 total yards on 26 plays (11.9 yards per play) at halftime after scoring on all five drives. The first four of those were at least 70 yards, and they needed only 20 on the last one after an interception in the final minute. 
“Unacceptable,” Dallas cornerback Trevon Diggs said. “It’s unacceptable we didn’t come to play today.”

Publication date:2024-09-15 07:00:00

ATLANTA (AP) — Trying to defend their narrow Senate majority with a challenging slate of contests on Republican-leaning turf, Democrats are pumping $25 million into expanded voter outreach across 10 states.
The new spending from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, first shared with The Associated Press, comes less than two months until the Nov. 5 election and as Democrats are benefiting from a fundraising surge since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party standard-bearer. 
“A formidable ground game makes all the difference in close races,” DSCC Chairman Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan said in a statement. “We are reaching every voter we need to win.”
The latest investment will be distributed across Arizona, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. The money will go toward efforts to defend five Democratic incumbents and open seats in Michigan, Maryland and Arizona that are currently included in Democrats’ majority, as well as efforts to unseat GOP incumbents in Florida and Texas.
Plans for the money will vary by state but will include hiring more paid field organizers and canvassers; digital organizing programs targeting specific groups of voters online; texting programs; and in-person organizing events targeting younger generations and nonwhite voters.
Democrats currently hold a 51-49 Senate advantage, a split that includes independent senators who caucus with Democrats. But of the 33 regular Senate elections this November, Democrats must defend 23 seats, counting the independents who caucus with them to make their majority. They’ve devoted few national resources to West Virginia, a Republican-leaning state where Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent, is retiring.


The playing field gives Democrats little margin for error. If they lose West Virginia and hold all other seats, they still would have to upset Florida Sen. Rick Scott or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to win a majority or hope Harris wins the presidential election — an outcome that would allow her running mate, Tim Walz, to cast the tiebreaking vote for Democrats as vice president, as Harris did in a 50-50 Senate during the first two years of Biden’s administration.
The DSCC declined to disclose a state-by-state distribution of the $25 million. But it’s no secret that Democrats’ defense of the majority starts with tough reelection contests for Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Both are relatively popular, multiterm incumbents, but they’re running in states where Donald Trump, the former president and current Republican nominee, has twice won by comfortable margins. That means Tester and Brown would need a considerable number of voters to split their tickets between Trump and their Senate choice.
Senate Democrats already have financed field offices in Montana and Ohio, since those are not presidential battleground states where the Harris campaign leads Democrats’ coordinated campaign operations. And even with the money coming from national coffers, the additional on-the-ground spending will reinforce the two Democratic senators’ strategies of distancing themselves from Harris and the national party. 
Five of the 10 states getting money, meanwhile, overlap with the presidential battleground map: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden won all of them four years ago, while Trump won all except Nevada in 2016. Both presidential campaigns see the states as tossups this fall. 
What to know about the 2024 Election
The voter outreach spending comes alongside an ongoing $79 million advertising effort by Democrats’ Senate campaign arm and builds on staffing and infrastructure investments that the national party arm already has made.
The outlay comes after Harris, who has raised more than $500 million since taking over the Democratic presidential ticket in July, announced plans to distribute $25 million to party committees that focus on down-ballot races. Senate and House Democrats’ respective campaigns each got $10 million of that money, an acknowledgment that Democratic majorities on Capitol Hill would make a Harris presidency more successful and that Harris and down-ballot Democrats can help each other at the ballot box.
Democratic aides said the on-the-ground spending was always in the Senate committee’s plans, but Harris’ bounty certainly expands options for all party-affiliated campaign groups. Democrats believe they have a superior campaign infrastructure to Trump and the rest of the GOP in a campaign year where the White House and control of Capitol Hill could be decided by marginal turnout changes among the parties’ core supporters and a narrow band of persuadable voters.
Still, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has outraised and outspent Senate Democrats this cycle, though Democrats had more cash on hand at the end of July, the last reporting period disclosed to the Federal Election Committee.
Through July 31, the NRSC had raised $181.3 million and spent $138.5 million. Republicans reported a balance of $51 million. Democrats had raised $154 million and spent $103.3 million. They reported a balance of $59.3 million.",False

Publication date:2024-09-10 07:00:00

GENEVA (AP) — Israel has intensified airstrikes on Iranian-linked targets in Syria, inflicting civilian casualties on at least three occasions, an independent U.N. commission said Tuesday. 
Since the Israel-Hamas war began nearly a year ago, Israel has conducted dozens of airstrikes in different parts of Syria. Iran blamed Israel for the April airstrike on Iranian consular offices in Damascus that killed seven people including two Iranian generals, and Tehran responded with an unprecedented attack against Israel almost two weeks later.
Regional tensions remain high after Iran vowed to retaliate for the July 31 killing of top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, believed to be carried out by Israel. 
The commission is made up of independent experts mandated by the U.N.’s top human rights body. It said it continues to investigate airstrikes, including Sunday’s strike in Syria’s central province of Hamas that killed 18 people, making it one of the deadliest in years.
The report comes as the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council on Monday began its five-week autumn session.
Israel has vowed to stop Iranian entrenchment in Syria where thousands of Iran-backed fighters are deployed. Syria is a key route for Iran to send weapons to Lebanon’s Hezbollah group. 
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said that since the war in Gaza started Oct. 7 with a Hamas attack, Israel carried out 76 airstrikes in different parts of the country. It said 287 Iranian-linked fighters and Syrian troops and 27 civilians, including two children, died in the strikes. 


The commission said groups affiliated with Iran have attacked bases housing U.S. troops in east Syria more than 100 times, most recently last month. U.S. forces responded with counterattacks. 
The commission also warned that Syria is falling deeper into an alarming humanitarian crisis that threatens to spiral out of control.
“Only a quarter of this year’s humanitarian needs are funded,” the commission said in a statement, adding that the needs are at their highest since the start of the conflict 13 years ago.
It added that 13 million Syrians face acute food insecurity and over 650,000 children show signs of stunting from severe malnutrition.
U.N. agencies and international humanitarian organizations have for years struggled with shrinking budgets, further worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and conflicts elsewhere. The war in Gaza as well as those in Ukraine and Sudan are the focus of the world’s attention.
Syria’s civil conflict, which has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of 23 million, has long remained largely frozen.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Giancarlo Stanton reached 25 homers for the 10th time in his big league career, Gerrit Cole struck out nine over six innings before his right calf cramped and the New York Yankees beat the Texas Rangers 8-4 on Monday night. 
Gleyber Torres had three hits for the AL-leading Yankees, including a two-run double in the third inning that put them ahead to stay. Anthony Rizzo had a two-run double in their five-run sixth inning after Aaron Judge doubled for his MLB-best 124th RBI. 
Before his last warmup pitch ahead of the seventh, Cole (6-3) lifted his right leg and tried to stretch. The Yankees ace and reigning AL Cy Young Award winner bent twice, threw the warmup, then hopped and signaled to the bench. Manager Aaron Boone and director of sports medicine Michael Shuck went to mound.
“Tried a couple things to get it to stop, and it just didn’t stop. So, didn’t seem like it was going to go away,” Cole said. “I wasn’t super concerned. I just didn’t think it was the right situation to keep trying to manipulate it out there.”
Cole, who turns 34 on Sunday, began this season on the 60-day injured list because of nerve irritation and edema in his throwing elbow during spring training. The right-hander, who didn’t make his season debut until June 19, said he wasn’t worried afterward since he only felt the cramps when following through on those warmup pitches.
Stanton homered to straightaway center leading off the eighth. He is the only active MLB player with 10 seasons of at least 25 homers. 


“Remarkably consistent his entire career. ... Probably one of the best sluggers of my generation, for sure,” Cole said. 
“It’s pretty cool. You know, something to add to whatever I can come up with in this career, but you know as long it helps us win, that’s what’s most important right now,” Stanton said. 
The Yankees (80-58) remained a half-game ahead of Baltimore in the AL East. They had lost four of their previous five games. 
With two on and two outs in the ninth, Torres made a diving backhand stop behind second base on Marcus Semien’s grounder and threw to first for the out.
Anthony Volpe and Alex Verdugo, the bottom two batters in the Yankees lineup, had one-out singles in the third inning before Torres doubled for a 2-0 lead. Rookie right-hander Jack Leiter ended that inning when he struck out MLB home run leader Judge, who swung at and missed an 84 mph curveball.
Leiter (0-2) was pulled after Judge’s RBI double in the sixth that made it 3-1, and was the third consecutive hit to start that inning. Leiter struck out two and was charged with five runs.
The 24-year-old Leiter threw 25 sliders and didn’t get a single swing and miss. Still, he pitched into the sixth inning for the first time in five big league starts. 
“I felt good about my stuff. I felt like execution-wise, that’s the best it’s been, at least up here so far this year,” Leiter said. “So then it becomes a conversation of, you know, navigating lineups a little better and maybe pitch selection here or there.”
Volpe and Leiter were high school teammates and part a state championship in 2019 at Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey. Both were first-round draft picks, Volpe by the Yankees that year and Leiter by Texas second overall in 2021 after he went to Vanderbilt. 
Leiter’s father, Al, played for the Yankees during his first three big league seasons (1987-89) and his last (2005). His cousin, Mark Leiter Jr., is a Yankees reliever. 
The Yankees led 7-1 when Cole left the game. Luke Weaver took over, immediately allowing a single to Josh Jung and a homer to Wyatt Langford.
Yankees RHP Clarke Schmidt (right lat strain) struck out seven without a walk while allowing two runs over 4 2/3 innings in a rehab start for Double-A Somerset. ... C Austin Wells stayed in the game after getting hit on a hand by a pitch while batting in the sixth.... RHP Luis Gil (lower back strain) is expected to rejoin the rotation this week. Gil (12-6, 3.39 ERA), whose last start for New York was on Aug. 20, threw 80 pitches in 3 2/3 innings in a rehab game for Somerset on Sunday. 
Rangers: Cy Young Award winners Jacob deGrom (elbow surgery rehab) and Max Scherzer (shoulder fatigue/nerve issue) are both scheduled to make rehab starts Saturday. While deGrom is set to pitch for Double-A Frisco, he said there could be the option that night of making his first start for the Rangers since April 28, 2023. The plan is for Scherzer to pitch for Triple-A Round Rock in Las Vegas. 
A matchup of left-handers in the middle game of the series Tuesday night. Carlos Rodón (14-9, 4.31 ERA) pitches for the Yankees while Andrew Heaney (4-13, 3.95), who has allowed only one run over 10 innings in his last two starts, starts for Texas.

DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Tigers, the hottest team in baseball the last several weeks, earned an American League wild card berth Friday night to end a decade-long postseason drought.
“This team is pretty dangerous,” Tigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris said. “We got a chance to make some noise in October, and we’re going to keep fighting for for the opportunity.”
Detroit clinched a spot in the playoffs with a 4-1 win over the Chicago White Sox, who set a modern major league record with their 121st loss.
The Tigers will play at top AL wild card Baltimore or AL West champion Houston in a best-of-three series starting Tuesday. They have been on a tear, winning six straight and 10 of 11 to surge into the playoffs for the first time since 2014.
Detroit was 55-63 on Aug. 10 — 10 games out of the last wild card — and then went 31-11. During that stretch, the Tigers have the lowest ERA in baseball and the largest run differential.
“It’s been a dream come true,” first baseman Spencer Torkelson said.
With two games left, the Tigers were in position for the second AL wild card, one game ahead of AL Central rival Kansas City, which also clinched a playoff spot on Friday while Minnesota was eliminated.
AL Cy Young Award favorite Tarik Skubal leads Detroit’s rotation and Jason Foley has become a reliable closer in a strong bullpen. He earned his 28th save in the series opener against Chicago.


Riley Greene, an All-Star outfielder, is the team’s top player in a lineup that gets timely hitting from the top to the bottom.
Torkelson, the No. 1 overall pick in 2020, was sent to the minors during the season and bounced back well enough to contribute to the team’s late run.
“That’s what makes it so special, when you do win,” Torkelson said. “It’s not always going to be perfect. You’re not always going to get a hit. You’re not always going to strike the guy out. But just grinding through it and and persevering, that’s what makes it so, so special.”
Taking advantage of playing a historically bad team, Detroit broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning of the playoff-clinching win. Jake Rogers scored when Jared Shuster was charged with a wild pitch even though the ball didn’t hit the dirt just below catcher Korey Lee’s glove.
Greene put Detroit ahead 3-1 with a double in the seventh, and Chicago helped the home team’s cause again later in the inning when Fraser Ellard threw the team’s third wild pitch of the night.
Detroit went into the season expecting to contend for a spot in the playoffs in a second full season under Harris and A.J. Hinch’s fourth year as manager.
“With every player I hugged, I had a flashback to some moment of adversity they faced, or some moment where we challenged them to do something differently and all of these guys did,” Harris said on the field following the game. “They rose to the occasion and they deserve it. I’m really, really proud of them.”
The Tigers started strong, winning six of their first seven games. They had a winning record until mid-May, when the team started to slide in the standings.
They appeared to be out of pitching at the end of July when Kenta Maeda was demoted to the bullpen, Casey Mize and Reese Olson were injured and Jack Flaherty was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Each time it looked like the Tigers might rally, they would fail to sustain success and many fans in the state turned their attention to football.
Hinch got creative, rolling with a rotation of Skubal and rookie Keider Montero while relying on the bullpen to pitch entire games such as the series opener against the White Sox in front of 44,435 fans at Comerica Park.
Skubal and Montero have combined to go 11-3 since August 1, but only one other starting pitcher has won a game, and that was Brant Hurter against the Los Angeles Angels a month ago.
The Motor City’s baseball team salvaged the season and revived interest, drawing big crowds after closing recent seasons in a mostly empty ballpark.
“It’s been a long time since this organization was in the playoffs and these fans deserve it,” Harris said.

Shedeur Sanders put his stamp on Colorado’s return to the Big 12 while energizing the league’s reputation for prolific passers.
Sanders threw for 341 yards in an overtime win over Baylor on Saturday. His 58-yard touchdown pass started the Buffaloes’ comeback from a 14-point deficit late in the second quarter, and his 43-yard Hail Mary TD to LaJohntay Wester as time ran out in regulation forced overtime.
“I’ll do whatever it takes to win,” Sanders said.
The Big 12 has two of the nation’s top five passers in yards per game, and five of the top 17. Sanders, TCU’s Josh Hoover and Arizona’s Noah Fifita have thrown for more than 400 yards in a game. Colorado and Arizona moved over from the Pac-12 this season, along with Arizona State and No. 10 Utah.
Considering how some Big 12 secondaries are struggling, those air-raid performances could easily continue as league play gets into full swing,
Texas Tech leads the nation in passing attempts and TCU, Colorado and No. 20 Oklahoma State are in the top six. Hoover, Sanders and Texas Tech’s Behren Morton are among the top six nationally in completions, all surpassing 25 per game.
The Big 12 has had more than two dozen 4,000-yard single-season passing performances, more than any other major college conference. But none have occurred in the league since Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray in 2018. Sanders and Hoover are on pace to join that club.


UCF coach Gus Malzahn, who recruited Sanders out of high school when Malzahn was at Auburn, is scheduled to face Sanders on Saturday in Orlando, Florida.
“You’ve got to put pressure on him, there’s no doubt,” Malzahn said. “You can just tell he’s a veteran guy. You can tell he stays calm. You can tell he’s a smart guy, too.”
Defenses around the league should be nervous.
Oklahoma State and Texas Tech allow more than 280 passing yards each game, ranking near the bottom nationally. Arizona State and West Virginia have given up a league-high nine TD passes each, and the Mountaineers’ 15.6 yards allowed per completion is dead last among the Power 4 conferences.
In addition, five Big 12 teams have new defensive coordinators this season. Baylor’s Dave Aranda took over defensive play-calling duties and the Bears had given up two TDs and 227 passing yards.
Then Sanders went off.
“We struggled to contain him when he was running around, and we struggled to make a play when the ball was in the air,” Aranda said.
High-flying offenses often need tuneups, and there’s plenty that needs fixing.
Sanders was sacked eight times Saturday and opponents have 16 against the Buffaloes this season, tied for the most in the nation.
Hoover, a sophomore, is averaging 346 yards per game over his first 10 starts dating to last season, including three 400-yard performances. But in TCU’s 66-42 loss to SMU, he had two interceptions and lost two fumbles that led to touchdowns.
“We’ve got to go back and figure out how you can do better, and I’m the guy at the top of the list,” Hoover said.
Oklahoma State’s Alan Bowman was pulled after a miserable first half in a 22-19 loss to Utah.
“I think he got uncomfortable, then he started moving his feet around a little bit and it just snowballed,” Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said.
After backup Garret Rangel also struggled, Bowman returned in the fourth quarter and threw for two touchdowns and two 2-point conversions.
Arkansas transfer KJ Jefferson is already having a big impact at UCF, which is the conference’s top scoring team at nearly 46 points per game.
Jefferson led UCF from 21 points down in the third quarter in their last game to beat TCU 35-34 in their league opener. Jefferson threw two of his three TD passes in the second half despite being banged up.
“He didn’t flinch. He was real positive and he’s a tough guy,” Malzahn said. “He willed us to win in that second half. That’s what veteran quarterbacks do.”
Jefferson’s average of 17.59 yards per completion ranks third in the Bowl Subdivision.
Two Big 12 quarterbacks with big preseason expectations have hit some stumbling blocks.
Utah’s Cam Rising threw for a career-high five TDs in the season opener, then hurt his right hand against Baylor the following week and hasn’t played since.
Jalon Daniels of Kansas threw his seventh interception of the season at West Virginia last week and has just four TD passes.
Looking for that next top-notch quarterback? Plenty can be found in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, where Bowman, Hoover, Sanders and Cincinnati’s Brendan Sorsby went to high school. Morton attended high school about 95 miles to the west.

PARMA, Italy (AP) — Cagliari moved off the bottom of Serie A after a hard-fought 3-2 win at Parma on Monday.
The Sardinian club started the day in last place, one of only two teams yet to record a win. It move up to 16th place.
Cagliari refused to buckle when Parma twice cancelled out its lead.
It started the brighter team and took a deserved lead in the 34th minute. The Parma defense failed to clear the ball and Angolan winger Zito Luvumbo crossed for Nadir Zortea to head home unchallenged.
Parma equalized after 62 minutes. Woyo Coulibaly showed some fancy footwork on the left wing before cutting back for Dennis Man to slot home with aplomb.
Romanian midfielder Marin replaced Luvumbo after 73 minutes and two minutes later he put his side ahead again.
Michel Adopo drove forward from midfield and fed Marin on the edge of the box and he steered a sublime shot into the far corner from 20 meters out.
Brazilian midfielder Hernani equalized from the penalty spot for Parma in the 87th but Cagliari was not to be denied and less than 60 seconds later Roberto Piccoli fired the winner.
Cagliari has five points from six games, the same as Parma, which is 15th.

HOUSTON (AP) — The Jacksonville Jaguars were up by three late in the third quarter Sunday with a chance to pad the lead after a 58-yard run by Tank Bigsby gave them a first down at the Houston 4.
But instead of a score, the Jaguars came up with a goose egg and the Texans rallied for a 24-20 victory to leave Jacksonville (0-4) winless.
After Bigsby’s run put them in scoring position, he had carries on the next two plays that got them to the 2. Trevor Lawrence then threw an incomplete pass intended for Gabe Davis to bring up fourth down.
Jacksonville went for it, but Lawrence was stuffed for no gain on the first play of the fourth quarter.
“Coach puts it in our hands, so we got to figure it out and make the play,” Lawrence said. “We had the opportunity. I felt like we had some good looks down there to do more with it and we weren’t able to capitalize.”
Coach Doug Pederson declined to discuss the play. 
“It’s a moot point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter now, so I’m not going to talk about it.”
Lawrence threw for 169 yards and two touchdowns as his streak of consecutive starts without a win stretched to nine games.
The Jaguars fell to 0-4 for the first time since opening the 2021 season with five straight losses. Tennessee is the NFL’s only other winless team, bringing an 0-3 record into a Monday night matchup against Miami. 
“No one likes to work all week to lose,” running back Travis Etienne said. “It’s kind of that same feeling, it’s kind of getting repetitive. No one likes that. Everyone’s frustrated but man, talking about it won’t help us. We just have to keep working... we just have to finish.” 


Pederson seemed caught off-guard when he was asked if he’s worried about his job status after the dismal start.

“My status? I mean, no,” he said. “That’s kind of a strange question, but OK.”
Though the goal line gaffe was their biggest missed opportunity Sunday, the Jaguars had other chances to close this one out after getting blown out by the Bills on Monday.
Lawrence brought up the team’s missed chances nine different times in his postgame comments. 
“We had a lot of opportunities, run game and throwing the ball down the field,” he said. “Didn’t capitalize on all of them, unfortunately, and that’s kind of why we’re here now and didn’t win the game in my opinion, because we didn’t take advantage of some of those opportunities.” 
Christian Kirk put the Jaguars up 20-17 with an 8-yard TD grab with about six minutes left in the third quarter. Brian Thomas powered that drive with a 32-yard reception and a 13-yard run.
After stopping the Texans to get the ball back, Derek Stingley knocked down Lawrence’s pass to force a punt with about six minutes left.
Jacksonville’s defense stopped Houston again after that, but the Jaguars managed just three plays before punting and ate less than a minute of the clock to give the Texans one last chance.
C.J. Stroud then put together a nine-play, 69-yard drive, capped by a 1-yard pass to Dare Ogunbowale with 18 seconds left, to give Houston the win.
Etienne said the Jaguars must look forward instead of worrying about what’s already happened.
“How can we be better next week? That’s the question I feel like we should be asking ourselves,” he said. “How can we be our best selves? How can we go 1-0 next week? Dwelling on how we got 0-4 or losing those games is not going to get us over the hump to win one game.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Kennedy Center and the union representing musicians in the National Symphony Orchestra have come to an agreement on a short-term contract after a brief strike that threatened to derail Saturday’s season-opening gala. 
The DC Federation of Musicians, local 161-710 of the American Federation of Musicians, went on strike Friday following the Sept. 2 expiration of its collective bargaining agreement, forcing the Kennedy Center to announce the cancellation of its gala. But within hours, the Kennedy Center announced that an 18-month labor agreement had been agreed upon, and Saturday’s concert and the rest of the 2024-25 season will proceed as scheduled. 
The short-term contract “will provide all parties time to come together to settle a longer-term agreement that demonstrates our respect for their artistic contributions and maintains the orchestra’s competitiveness in the field,” the Kennedy Center said in a statement. 
The NSO season at the Kennedy Center kicks off Saturday night with music director Gianandrea Noseda conducting a program that includes pianist Yunchan Lim. The previous deal originally was a four-year contract through the 2022-23 season, but was extended by one year during the pandemic.
The new holding agreement will increase wages by 4% in the first year and 4% in the second year with negotiations on a longer-term deal to commence in early 2026. The contract will bring the base salary for musicians to $165,268 and then $171,879. 
The Kennedy Center statement said the agreement will allow the NSO musicians to “retain their position as one of the highest compensated orchestras in the country.”",False

TOKYO (AP) — The person chosen Friday to lead Japan’s governing party, and become prime minister next week, is a veteran politician with deep policy experience, a taste for curry and anime — and big challenges ahead of him as he tries to unite a fractious party and hold off an opposition eager to capitalize on recent corruption scandals.
Shigeru Ishiba has long been popular with voters but has often struggled to win over his conservative fellow Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers.
A vocal critic of the hawkish politics of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he was long seen as a troublesome outsider by some party members. That makes Friday’s victory a huge comeback for Ishiba. It could also signal a break from years of Abe’s influence over the party, even after the former prime minister’s assassination. 
Some analysts believe that Ishiba was chosen as much for his image as a centrist who can counter challenges by the more liberal main opposition party as for his policy views.
The 67-year-old former banker was running in the party leadership race for a fifth time and had said this was going to be his “final battle.” 
Ishiba was first elected to parliament in 1986, after being influenced by the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who was popular with the public. He has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and as the LDP secretary general under Abe.


His party will now look for him to use his experience, stability and expertise to beat back the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, which recently chose as its new leader former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, a veteran known for his inspiring speeches.
University of Tokyo politics professor Yu Uchiyama said political parties tend to make centrist shifts to win elections, and Ishiba could do well in an upcoming parliamentary face-off with the opposition leader. 
Considered a defense policy expert, Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and a more equal and mutual Japan-U.S. security alliance, including having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States. 
“Mr. Ishiba has ideas about security that may go beyond what the United States expects from Japan, like an Asian version of NATO,” said Masato Kamikubo, a political science professor at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. “But I don’t think there will be a change in Japan-U.S. diplomatic and security relations.”
Ishiba is a supporter of Taiwan’ s democracy. He calls for the establishment of a disaster management agency in one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.
Ishiba has vowed to push for more diversity and gender equality. He supports a revision to a 19th century civil code that requires married couples to choose one of their surnames. That has caused most women to adopt their husband’s surname. Moves to change the code have stalled for decades because of LDP opposition.
At a recent speech in Tokyo, Ishiba said Japanese women are among the shortest sleepers in the world because of their heavy responsibilities both at work and home. He said most husbands, including himself, hardly help with childrearing and homemaking.
Ishiba also supports legalizing same-sex marriage.
Ishiba is known as a policy “otaku,” or nerd, especially in security and defense issues. He likes anime, building model warships and listening to 1970s and ‘80s Japanese pop songs. He says his favorite food is curried rice.",False

STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. (AP) — To Ruth Breeden, whose job is to assemble Ram trucks in this Detroit suburb, a simmering dispute between the United Auto Workers union and Stellantis isn’t merely about whether her employer will reopen a distant factory in Illinois. To her, the standoff is a danger sign for all UAW workers.
Belvidere, Illinois, is the site of an assembly plant that Stellantis had pledged to reopen under a contract it forged last year with the union. But the company, which reported poor sales and earnings this year, has delayed the reopening given what it calls unfavorable “market conditions.” Stellantis says it will eventually meet its commitment to reopen the plant.
Yet no date has been given for the company to restart the factory or to open a new battery plant and a new parts warehouse, both which were also promised in the contract agreement that ended the UAW’s strike against Stellantis last year. At stake are about 2,700 jobs.
Breeden and other union members say they fear that Stellantis will break other commitments in other states, eventually jeopardizing their jobs.
“It’s the whole company,” she said at a union rally last month in front of her factory in Sterling Heights. “Who knows which plant is next?” 
Anxious and angry about Stellantis’ delay, union leaders have threatened to strike, a move that could extend beyond Stellantis. Labor experts say its two Detroit-area rivals, Ford and General Motors, are watching as they weigh their own strategies, including whether to move future production sites out of the United States and away from the UAW.


Detroit automakers have been expanding production in Mexico for years. And after last fall’s strikes shut down a Ford truck plant, its CEO warned that the company would have to rethink where it builds new vehicles. 
“There’s plenty of history of the U.S. manufacturing sector moving its operations to low-wage countries,” said Bob Bruno, a labor and employment relations professor at the University of Illinois. “It seems reasonable to me for the UAW to be concerned about not opening here, not investing here, but beginning to move operations someplace else as the company looks at essentially how they can build their cars for the cheapest cost.” 
In February 2023, the last Jeep Cherokee small SUV rolled off the line at the Belvidere Assembly Plant, about an hour northwest of Chicago, and 1,350 workers were laid off. Stellantis had plans to shutter the factory for good.
A few months later, Belvidere emerged as an issue in the UAW’s first direct election of its officers in the wake of a bribery-and-embezzlement scandal involving the union’s previous leadership. Shawn Fain, who won the UAW presidency, demanded that Belvidere be reopened.
After the six-week strike against all three Detroit automakers last fall, each company signed a new contract with the UAW. Under the deal with Stellantis, it agreed to reopen the Belvidere assembly plant in 2027, with plans to build up to 100,000 electric and gas-powered midsize pickups annually.
It also agreed to open a parts distribution hub in Belvidere this year and an electric-vehicle battery factory with 1,300 workers in 2028. In all, the company pledged $18.9 billion of U.S. investments during the contract, which runs until April 2028. 
So promising was the prospect of reopening Belvidere that it drew a celebratory visit from President Joe Biden and a pledge of $335 million in federal dollars to revamp the 5-million-square-foot plant, which began building vehicles in 1965.
A year later, there’s no parts hub and no definitive plan to open the assembly and battery plants. Stellantis’ vague pledge to eventually open the facilities sounded the alarm among the union members.
“If they violate this, what are they going to violate moving forward?” asked Kevin Gotinsky, who leads the UAW’s talks with Stellantis. 
On Wednesday, Stellantis did announce that it would spend roughly $400 million to revamp three Michigan factories to build electric vehicles or parts. Breeden’s plant will receive about $235 million of the money, which was included in the UAW’s contract.
Still, Breeden said she fears that the company’s CEO, Carlos Tavares, who talks frequently about cutting costs, wants to move more production to low-wage Mexico. The company already builds Ram pickups in Saltillo, Mexico. She fears that Stellantis might decide to move some production there and away from her plant.
“The truth is Stellantis doesn’t want to invest in America,” Fain said in a recent UAW video. 
Tavares has told reporters that one reason Stellantis needs to slash costs is so it can make electric vehicles — which cost roughly 40% more to build than gas-powered cars do — affordable to typical customers.
Breeden’s friend Jazmine Johnson, who has spent a decade with the company helping build Jeep SUVs, shares Breeden’s concerns. Both say they’re willing to strike.
“You’ve got to be ready to fight,” Johnson said.
In the end, experts say, the Belvidere matter could end up in court.
Tavares has taken the unusual step of singling out the Sterling Heights Ram plant for criticism for encountering problems with trucks that were built there but not yet shipped. The company has also complained about high absenteeism among workers at Stellantis’ U.S. factories.
Local union officials counter that Stellantis has made a high number of temporary hires who have caused much of the absenteeism. Fain also argues that Stellantis’ management has tended to buy poorly made low-cost parts.
In August, Stellantis announced it would stop making older Ram pickups at a plant in Warren, Michigan, and it will lay off as many as 2,400 workers. It was the latest sign that Stellantis’ U.S. workers face an uncertain future, said Marick Masters, business professor emeritus at Wayne State University who follows labor issues.
“I think the apprehension workers have is well-founded,” he said.
Stellantis said it stands by its commitment to Belvidere under the contract it signed with the UAW. But it said it needs the delay so it can afford to remain competitive and preserve U.S. factory jobs.
“It is critical that the business case for all investments is aligned with market conditions and our ability to accommodate a wide range of consumer demands,” Jodi Tinson, a Stellantis spokeswoman, said in a statement.
Tinson said the company isn’t violating its commitments, noting language in a letter detailing investments that’s part of the UAW contract. The letter said Stellantis and the UAW agree that investment and jobs in North America are “contingent upon plant performance, changes in market conditions, and consumer demand continuing to generate sustainable and profitable (sales) volumes.”
Maite Tapia, an associate professor at Michigan State University’s School of Human Resources and Labor Relations, noted that language in union contracts is often intended to appease both parties.
“The union could sell the agreement to their members,” Tapia said, “because it has clear language about investment and reopening Belvidere, whereas the employer was fine with it as well, given this broad clause that could potentially give them the right not to invest.”
The UAW counters that its contract with Stellantis authorizes it to strike over plant closures and broken investment promises. 
Stellantis, which has been slow to shift its production toward increasingly popular lower-cost vehicles, has struggled this year. Its U.S. sales fell nearly 16% in the first half of the year. Profits tumbled 50%. As a result, the company’s inventory reached nearly 400,000 as of July, the highest level in the industry. 
Still, overall U.S. sales of new vehicles rose 2.4% in the first half of the year. The union argues that GM and Ford are doing well and that Stellantis would be, too, if not for poor management by Tavares. 
Fueling the angst on U.S. assembly lines is a statement made in February by Ford’s CEO Jim Farley, who said his company would rethink where it builds vehicles. Farley sounded that warning after the UAW’s 2023 strikes shut down Ford’s largest and most profitable plant, which makes heavy-duty trucks in Louisville, Kentucky. In July, Ford said it would revamp a factory in Ontario to build the same trucks.
Before last year’s strikes, Farley said, Ford continued to make pickups in the United States despite higher labor costs and competitors that had opened plants in Mexico. The CEO said he was particularly upset that the union strike shut down the Louisville plant.
Fain, the union president, scoffed at the notion that Detroit’s automakers will be compelled to move production out of the U.S. because of the new contract and a more aggressive union. He complained that over the past 20 years, the companies have closed or sold 65 factories during a period where the UAW was more cooperative.
“That’s hundreds of thousands of jobs that cost us,” Fain said in an interview with The Associated Press. “So don’t talk to me about your commitment to the American worker when that’s your traditional history.”
In the meantime, the standoff with Stellantis over Belvidere has led the UAW to threaten to strike as early as October.
“We expect them to honor the commitment they made,” Fain said. “If they don’t, we put language in this agreement so that we can hold them accountable. And we’re going to.”

NEW YORK (AP) — A $10,000 literary award named for the late author-editor-podcaster Gabe Hudson has been established by the publisher McSweeney’s, where Hudson once worked.
The inaugural winner, Ayana Mathis’ “The Unsettled,” was announced Thursday, on what would have been Hudson’s 53rd birthday. He died last year from complications due to undiagnosed diabetes. Hudson published two books, the story collection “Dear Mr. President” and the novel “Gork the Teenage Dragon,” and was widely admired for his support of other writers.
“It is the privilege of a lifetime to become part of Gabe’s legacy of generosity, literary community, and artistic excellence as the inaugural recipient of this distinguished award,” Mathis said in a statement.
The prize, which honors the best second work of fiction of the previous year, was decided upon by a four-judge panel led by novelist Akhil Sharma. Hudson’s mother, Sanchia Semere, provided funding for the award. 
“Gabe, my son, wanted to be a writer from a young age. He was a voracious reader, and was friends with many in the writing community, as well as a friend to many who sought his advice on writing,” Semere said in a statement. “I recall Gabe submitting to McSweeney’s early on, and the thrill he experienced when McSweeney’s published a submission. I can think of no better way for Gabe’s name to live on than to establish the Gabe Hudson Prize at McSweeney’s to award writers whose second books exemplify the notions of humor, satire and the generosity of spirit for which Gabe was known.”
Runners-up for the Hudson prize were Justin Torres’ “Blackouts,” Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah’s “Chain Gang All-Stars” and Hilary Leichter’s “Terrace Story.”",False

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals have walked out of Arrowhead Stadium both elated and dejected over the years. Most of the time it has been January, and they have been playing the Kansas City Chiefs for a spot in the Super Bowl.
There wasn’t that same sort of finality on Sunday. But another last-second loss was brutal in its own way.
The Bengals had fought and rallied and fought some more to take the lead on Evan McPherson’s fourth field goal with just under 10 minutes to go. And after their defense had forced Kansas City to punt, it was on the verge of another big stop, when a penalty on safety Daijahn Anthony inside the final minute kept the Chiefs’ own comeback hopes alive.
A few plays later, Harrison Butker kicked a 51-yard field goal as time expired to give Kansas City a 26-25 victory.
“It hurts,” Bengals coach Zac Taylor admitted, “but I’m really proud of the way we fought. We put ourselves in some really good situations in both halves. The defense getting those takeaways was critical. I’m disappointed that we lost. It was an emotional loss for us. But at the same time, I like where our team’s mental state is right now.”
It was an especially emotional game for Bengals star Ja’Marr Chase, who had to be held back from referee Alex Kemp at one point in the fourth quarter after he thought a penalty should have been called for a hip-drop tackle on him.


It was Burrow who physically dragged his wide receiver away as Kemp threw a flag for unsportsmanlike conduct.
“It’s just simply abusive language toward a game official. That’s all it was,” Kemp said after the game. “There was really no interpretation. I’m not going to repeat to you what he said, but there was no interpretation with the language that he used.”

Kemp said Chase crossed a line when it became “profanity used by grown men versus direct, personal, abusive language towards a game official. That’s the line. When that line gets crossed, we simply can’t let that happen in pro football.”
Chase refused to discuss the penalty in the postgame locker room, saying only: “It doesn’t feel great losing.”
“It’s OK to be emotional,” Taylor said. “I can’t see everything that’s said or done, so it’s better that I not comment on it.”
The Bengals still have 15 games ahead of them, but they are already in a deep hole. Their surprising loss to the Patriots in their season opener means they are 0-2, and should Taylor manage to get them turned around and into the playoffs, they now face the prospect of Kansas City holding the tiebreaker over them.
That could mean another matchup in Arrowhead Stadium. Butker’s kick on Sunday was the same direction, and almost the same distance, as the 45-yarder he hit against the Bengals for a 23-20 victory in the AFC championship game on Jan. 29, 2023.
There were certainly bright spots for Cincinnati, especially after its performance last week against New England.
Burrow looked much better throwing the ball, finishing with 258 yards passing and two touchdowns. Most importantly, he did not seem to be affected by his bothersome wrist in his second game since having surgery on it.
Burrow did fumble the ball, though, and Chamarri Conner returned it 37 yards for a second-half touchdown.
“I gifted them six points,” Burrow said, “so that was frustrating.”
Both of his touchdown passes went to Andrei Iosivas, who came through as Tee Higgins missed another game with a hamstring injury. Iosivas and tight end Mike Gesicki, who had seven catches for 91 yards, also helped make up for a poor game from Chase, who was limited to four catches for 35 yards and had the silly unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.
That flag was thrown after Chase’s reception had set up a manageable third down midway through the fourth quarter. The 15-yard penalty pushed the Bengals back to third-and-22 at the Kansas City 45, and after a 10-yard pass to Gesicki, the Bengals had to kick a field goal for a 25-23 lead with just over five minutes left in the game.
Ultimately, penalties were a big reason why the Bengals came undone. They had eight of them for 79 yards. And while the one against Chase was important, the one against Anthony on fourth down in the final minute was crippling.
“We’ve been here before, unfortunately. We know what this feels like, and we know it’s a long season,” Taylor said. “We know we can get ourselves out of it. Stick together. Get our emotions in check and come back (next week) and play a great game.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Sabrina Ionescu’s relationship with Spike Lee goes back to when she was drafted by the New York Liberty.
The basketball super fan was one of the first people to welcome her to New York when the Liberty took her No. 1 in 2020.
“He was the first person who called me and shared the excitement with New York getting the No. 1 pick,” Ionescu said after scoring 21 points in an 87-77 win over Las Vegas on Sunday. “Every time I’ve seen him we’ve had small talk and I said he’s got to come out to a game. To be able to see him here cheering us on loud, over there chirping at the refs and talking to the players.”
Lee has been a fixture at New York Knicks games over the years and has routinely trash-talked opposing players including famously Reggie Miller. He was sitting courtside at Barclays Center, wearing an Ionescu jersey. 
This time, Aces guard Kelsey Plum was the object of his good-natured trash talk.
“I can’t say exactly what was said, but I told him that he should talk louder,” Plum said smiling after the game. “But it was all well and fun and really cool that he’s here, even last round was really cool. I know he’s a big sports fan.”
This was the second straight Liberty playoff game Lee’s attended. He was also at the opening round clincher over Atlanta. At the first game he gave Ionescu a high-five in the third quarter that she said felt like “New York was injected into my veins.”
Lee was part of the sellout crowd of 14,015 that also included Liberty fan Jason Sudeikis and Tracy Morgan.

DORTMUND, Germany (AP) — Serhou Guirassy scored twice and won a penalty as Borussia Dortmund overturned a two-goal deficit to beat local rival Bochum 4-2 in the Bundesliga on Friday ahead of facing Celtic in the Champions League next week.
Dortmund had been demolished 5-1 by Stuttgart last week and the pressure on new coach Nuri Sahin seemed to be mounting when his team conceded two early goals against Bochum.
In the space of five minutes, Matus Bero scored off a smartly executed one-two through the center, then Dani de Wit made it 2-0 after teammate Myron Boadu had snatched the ball off Dortmund’s goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. On the sideline, Sahin spread his arms wide in a gesture of indignation.
Dortmund clawed its way back into the game, first with a Guirassy header just before halftime to cut the deficit to 2-1, then a penalty from Emre Can leveled the score after a clumsy foul on Guirassy.
It was Dortmund’s turn to slice through Bochum on the counter after that, Karim Adeyemi playing a perfect through-ball for Guirassy to make it 3-2 with a shot between goalkeeper Patrick Drewes’ legs. A fumble by Drewes let Felix Nmecha’s shot roll over the line for Dortmund’s fourth.
Dortmund rises to second in the table ahead of the weekend’s games, behind only Bayern Munich, and has 10 points from five games. Last season’s Champions League runner-up continues its campaign in the revamped competition at home to Scottish club Celtic on Tuesday.
Bochum is second-to-last in the 18-team Bundesliga with a solitary point under new coach Peter Zeidler.

Publication date:2024-09-17 07:00:00

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel said Tuesday that halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the country’s north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal, as it considers a wider military operation in Lebanon that could ignite an all-out conflict. 

Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to take heavier military action to halt the near-daily attacks, which began shortly after the outbreak of the nearly yearlong Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israel has regularly launched airstrikes on Lebanon in response and has targeted and killed senior Hezbollah commanders. 

As recently as last month it appeared a full-blown war was imminent.

Tuesday’s statement by Israel’s security Cabinet signaled a tougher stance at a time when Israeli leaders have stepped up their warnings. But it also appeared to be largely symbolic and may not herald an immediate change in policy.

The tit-for-tat strikes have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanon border. Hezbollah has said it would halt the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but those talks have repeatedly bogged down. 

The United States has pressed for restraint even as it has rushed military aid to Israel, warning its close ally that a wider war would not achieve its goals.

Israeli media have meanwhile reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and replacing him with Gideon Saar, the leader of a small right-wing party who is seen as more hawkish. That would be the biggest leadership shakeup in Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza and set off wider regional tensions.



The announcement on Lebanon came after Israel’s security Cabinet met late into the night. It said the Cabinet has “updated the objectives of the war” to include safely returning the residents of the north to their homes.

“Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,” it said.

U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made several visits to Lebanon and Israel to try to ease tensions, met with Netanyahu on Monday.

Hochstein told Netanyahu that intensifying the conflict with Hezbollah would not help return Israelis evacuated from the border area to their homes, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks.

According to the official, Hochstein argued that Netanyahu risked sparking a broad and protracted regional conflict if he moved forward with a full-scale war in Lebanon and said the Biden administration remained committed to finding a diplomatic solution in conjunction with a Gaza cease-fire or on its own.

Netanyahu told Hochstein that residents cannot return without “a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,” according to a statement from the prime minister’s office. It said that while Netanyahu “appreciates and respects” U.S. support, Israel will “do what is necessary to safeguard its security.”

Defense Minister Gallant has meanwhile said the focus of the conflict is shifting from Gaza to Israel’s north. He told U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin this week that time is running out for an agreement with Hezbollah, saying “the trajectory is clear.”

Hezbollah has said that while it does not want a wider war it is prepared for one. 

Raed Berro, a member of Hezbollah’s bloc in the Lebanese parliament, said Monday that the militant group “is ready for confrontation and has a lot in its pocket to deter the enemy and protect Lebanon in case Netanyahu thinks of expanding the war.”

Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a close political ally of Hezbollah, largely dismissed the warnings, telling a local newspaper that the Lebanese have grown used to the “increasing Israeli threats … even if their tone has become louder recently.”

The war in Gaza began when Hamas launched a surprise attack into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Militants are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after releasing most of the rest during a cease-fire last year.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in the territory since Oct. 7, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children.

Iran supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other militant groups across the region, which have carried out strikes on Israeli and U.S. targets in solidarity with the Palestinians. A missile launched by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Sunday set off air raid sirens in central Israel without causing casualties. Israel has hinted at a military response.

Israel and Iran traded fire directly for the first time in April, and Iran has threatened to avenge the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in an explosion in Tehran in July. The targeted killing was widely blamed on Israel, which has not said whether it was involved.

The U.S., Qatar and Egypt have spent most of this year trying to broker an agreement in which Hamas would release the hostages in exchange for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

President Joe Biden endorsed the framework of the agreement in May and the U.N. Security Council backed it days later. But since then, both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands, and the talks appear to be at an impasse.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert has a reshuffled offensive line protecting him against the Kansas City Chiefs.
That’s not encouraging news for Herbert, who is still hampered by a high right ankle sprain that occurred two weeks ago at Carolina. 
The Chargers are missing both starting offensive tackles for Sunday’s game after left tackle Rashawn Slater and right tackle Joe Alt were declared inactive because of injuries.
Slater suffered a pectoral injury during the first half last week. Alt is dealing with a sprained MCL that happened during the fourth quarter.
Trey Pipkins, who started the first three games at right guard, has shifted to right tackle. Pipkins started 31 games at right tackle in 2022 and ’23, but moved to guard this year when the Chargers made Alt the fifth overall pick in the draft.
Sam Mustipher was called up from the practice squad and started at right guard. Mustipher is in his fifth season and has 42 NFL starts in Chicago and Baltimore. However, he has taken only three snaps at right guard in a game.
Jamaree Salyer started at left tackle. The third-year lineman had 14 starts at the spot in 2022 after Slater had a season-ending biceps injury. 
Center Bradley Bozeman and left guard Zion Johnson remained in their usual spots.
Herbert was limited in practice this week but participated all three days. The fifth-year quarterback came out during the third quarter of last week’s 20-10 loss at the Pittsburgh Steelers after taking repeated hits to the ankle.
The Chargers are also missing linebacker Joey Bosa (hip) and safety Derwin James (suspension).
Los Angeles has lost five straight when facing the Chiefs. The Chargers have not defeated their AFC rival on their home field since 2013.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed Monday they shot down another American-made MQ-9 Reaper drone over the country, with videos purportedly showing a surface-to-air missile striking it. The U.S. military acknowledged losing a drone. 
The claimed attack comes as the one-year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip approaches. The Houthis have targeted ships traveling through the Red Sea over the war as U.S.-led airstrikes pound their positions in Yemen. That’s imperiled a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion of trade pass through it, as well as crucial shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and Yemen. 
The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel, drawing retaliatory airstrikes from the Israelis this weekend on the port city of Hodeida. 
Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a military spokesman, claimed the rebels shot down the MQ-9 in a prerecorded message aired Monday night, hours after video footage circulated online showing the purported missile striking the aircraft over Yemen’s Saada province. A single image online also appeared to show wreckage of the drone, with pieces resembling that of an MQ-9. 
Later footage released by the Houthis showed rebels had piled up the drone’s electronics, likely to see what they can exploit from the wreckage. One piece appeared to be from an MK-82 bomb, which can be armed on a Reaper. 
Responding to queries from The Associated Press, the U.S. military acknowledged an MQ-9 was “downed but we have nothing additional to provide.” 


General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years.
Since Houthis seized the country’s north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the U.S. military has seen Reapers shot down in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military acknowledged the Houthis shot down two MQ-9s in September. 
Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.
The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
Those attacks include a barrage that struck the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in the Red Sea. Salvagers have towed away the burning oil tanker, hoping to avoid a catastrophic leak of its 1 million barrels of oil on board. Firefighting efforts onboard the Sounion began last week and “the operation has proceeded with promising results as some fires are extinguished and other under control,” the Joint Maritime Information Center reported Monday.
The center, overseen by the U.S. Navy, also acknowledged the last attack on a merchant ship by the Houthis came on Sept. 2, but the rebels remain a threat.
“Despite a drop in attacks against merchant vessels over the last two weeks, the Houthis have shown ability and willingness to target U.S. Navy assets and coalition partners,” the center said. 
The Houthis claimed an attack targeted American warships last week. The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Fire everybody.
That sentiment could have resonated through Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan’s head during the most embarrassing prime-time debacle in franchise history. The Jaguars looked disinterested and disorganized long before they became despondent in a 47-10 drubbing at Buffalo on Monday night.
Jacksonville is winless — and often noncompetitive — through three games. It surely won’t sit well with Khan, whose team again is a laughingstock just two months after he proclaimed it “the best team assembled by the Jacksonville Jaguars ever” and added that “winning now” should be the expectation.
Trevor Lawrence has clearly regressed under coach Doug Pederson and offensive coordinator Press Taylor, losing his eighth consecutive start and looking nothing like the “generational quarterback” the Jaguars thought they landed when they drafted him first overall in 2021.
Lawrence isn’t getting enough help, either. His receiving corps has the NFL’s most drops over the last four seasons. His aging offensive line is among the league’s most porous. And his playbook seems predictable and pedestrian.
“There has to be changes, whether it’s play design, personnel,” Pederson said. “Everything is on the table.”
Pederson should get the brunt of the blame for the team’s on-field performance. But general manager Trent Baalke is equally at fault.


Baalke handed out nearly $500 million in contracts to three guys who have done little since — Lawrence, pass rusher Josh Hines-Allen and injured cornerback Tyson Campbell — while failing to sufficiently upgrade the O-line after Lawrence was sacked a career-high 35 times last year and knocked out of four games with injuries. Lawrence already has been sacked 11 times this season.

The bottom line: The Jaguars are averaging 13.3 points, the third fewest in the league and the franchise’s lowest output through three games since a massive makeover in 2013.
Yet, somehow, defense was a bigger issue against the Bills, who scored touchdowns on their first five possessions. Jacksonville barely touched quarterback Josh Allen and was a step slow in man-to-man coverages.
The unit is giving up 361 yards a game, has five sacks and no turnovers. The defense collapsed against Miami in the opener, got gashed by undermanned Cleveland in Week 2 and then humiliated on national TV. Not an ideal start for new coordinator Ryan Nielsen, who replaced 2023 scapegoat Mike Caldwell.
Only six NFL teams since 1979 have made the playoffs after starting 0-3, including just one since 2000, and none has won a Super Bowl. So Jacksonville’s season seems lost before October.
And now the attention turns to Khan. He’s unlikely to do anything rash, especially after just three games, but he surely will take a closer look at what’s going on between Baalke, Pederson and players over the next three months.
“Maybe the kickoff touchback.” That was Pederson’s response when asked to find a positive Monday night.
Almost everything. The Jaguars have scored 23 points in their last 10 quarters, the most futile stretch of offense the franchise has witnessed since that 2013 season in which the Jaguars essentially fielded an expansion team.
Christian Kirk caught eight passes for 79 yards, by far his best game of the season. But Kirk also had a pass bounce off his facemask in the end zone in the fourth quarter.
Right tackle Walker Little replaced injured starter Anton Harrison late in the third and made three mistakes in a five-snap sequence. He was twice flagged for a false start and then whiffed trying to block Von Miller on a fourth-down play, leading to the fourth sack of Lawrence.
Harrison (knee), linebacker Foye Oluokun (foot) and rookie cornerback Jarrian Jones (shoulder). Jones’ early injury was significant because it left the Jaguars without three of their top defensive backs; Campbell (hamstring) and Darnell Savage (quadricep) were inactive.
1 — Number of teams in NFL history that have made the playoffs after starting 0-4. The San Diego Chargers accomplished the feat in 1992 behind coach Bobby Ross, quarterback Stan Humphries and linebacker Junior Seau.
The Jaguars will need to win at AFC South rival Houston (2-1) on a short week to avoid the sixth 0-4 start in franchise history.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Friday ordered a mental health evaluation for a man arrested after an explosive went off in a courthouse lobby that injured five people and who officials say had told law enforcement he had planned to kill deputies and a judge in the building. 
U.S. Magistrate Judge A. Joel Richlin in Los Angeles ordered the evaluation after Nathaniel McGuire, 20, had an outburst at his arraignment hearing, yelling about world events and blaming the government. The outburst occurred when prosecutors requested that he remain in custody. McGuire did not enter a plea and will have another arraignment hearing Oct. 18. His defense also recommended a separate medical evaluation.
McGuire has been charged with maliciously damaging a building with an explosive, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles said in a statement. 
McGuire was arrested Wednesday outside the courthouse in the city of Santa Maria after throwing the bag as he yelled “Liberty or Death,” according to court documents. McGuire had been arrested last July on suspicion of illegal gun possession and was to be arraigned at the courthouse.
The explosion injured five people, including three who suffered burns. All were treated and released.
Santa Barbara County authorities evacuated a five-block radius of businesses, homes and a school after the explosion in Santa Maria, which is home to about 110,000 people in the central coast region.


Federal public defender Iboh Umodu who is representing McGuire declined to comment. 
McGuire told law enforcement after his arrest that he had gone to the courthouse planning to kill deputies working at the security desk and then go back to his car to get weapons and reenter the courthouse to kill a judge, federal officials said.
McGuire was arrested as he was trying to get into his car, which was parked nearby, and “yelled that the government had taken his guns and that everyone needed to fight, rise up, and rebel,” the statement said.
At the arraignment, McGuire also said he was “censored” from speaking out.
“You guys are the real criminals,” McGuire shouted, appearing visibly distressed as his defense attorney tried to calm him down.
Authorities said they later found ammunition, a rifle, a suspected bomb, fireworks and 10 Molotov cocktails inside the car and other materials used in making explosives during a search of McGuire’s home.
“The idea of intentionally setting off an explosive device to do harm and avoid justice in the process shocks the conscience,” Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s field office in Los Angeles, said in the statement.

Publication date:2024-09-16 07:00:00

The second game of Jayden Daniels’ NFL career delivered his first victory as quarterback of the Washington Commanders. It also came with six trips to the red zone, zero touchdowns and an important lesson.
“We’ve got to finish in the red zone; that’s the main thing we can take away from that,” Daniels said. “Extremely frustrating. We moved the ball efficiently down the field and, not to say anything, but to go out there and leave points on the field, man, we work so hard to get down there — we want touchdowns.”
Instead, they got flags. Five false-start penalties stalled out drives and provided a reminder that this transformed offense with Daniels, a revamped line and new coordinator Kliff Kingsbury still has work to do to get on the same page.
“Luckily, those are things that we can control, so we can get that corrected,” said running back Austin Ekeler, one of more than 30 new players on Washington’s 53-man roster. “We will definitely be emphasizing that going forward. It’s the details of going through practice and saying: ‘Hey, we’ve been through this. We can’t be doing this to ourselves, especially in the red zone.”
The Commanders, who are 1-1 going into a matchup at 0-2 Cincinnati next Monday night, reached the 20-yard line seven times Sunday against the New York Giants and could not crack the end zone. Rookie tight end Ben Sinnott false-started on fourth-and-1 on their opening possession; right guard Sam Cosmi moved early twice and left guard Nick Allegretti and left tackle Cornelius Lucas once each.


Allegretti, who started in two of the Chiefs’ Super Bowl victories during his five seasons with Kansas City, said holdovers are usually able to provide tips on how a quarterback likes to do snap cadences at the line of scrimmage. That’s not a luxury this unit has.

“With such a new offensive line and a new quarterback, none of us have those prior experiences from the year before, so there’s a lot of stuff that we have to learn from,” Allegretti said.
New kicker Austin Seibert went 7 for 7 on field-goal attempts, the Giants lost kicker Graham Gano to injury on the opening kickoff and Washington won 21-18. But first-year coach Dan Quinn thought the penalties were the real story of the game.
“Those were things that we’ve got to be able to clean up,” Quinn said. “The combative ones, we’re going to continue to teach and go with. But pre- or post-snap, those are the ones that we’ve got to get out of our game, and so we’ll work hard to do that.”
Finally, the kicking game. The Commanders signed Seibert last week to replace Cade York, who missed both of his field-goal attempts in a season-opening loss at Tampa Bay.
The 27-year-old, who has bounced around the league and spent training camp with the Jets, was good from 27, 45, 26, 27, 29, 33 and 30 yards out, the final one putting Washington ahead as the clock expired.
“To come in and make all of the field goals and to close the game out, just a special performance,” six-time All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner said.
The fundamentals of tackling, for one, even though the defense showed some improvement by forcing a turnover and not falling apart late. It might have been a different story if Daniel Jones and the Giants could have played for field goals.
“We still have to clean up our tackling, still got to clean up some of our execution, but wins are hard to come by in this league, so we’ll take it,” Wagner said. “We’re professionals. There’s no excuses. We’ve just got to be better.”
Receiver Noah Brown joined the team on Aug. 29 after being cut by Houston and immediately began working with Daniels to get up to speed. After sitting out Week 1 against the Buccaneers, Brown caught three passes from Daniels for 56 yards and looks like he could be a significant contributor moving forward.
“That’s what I expected out of myself,” said Brown, who had 115 receptions for 1,547 yards and five touchdowns in his first six pro seasons with the Cowboys and Texans. “I am a professional, and I’ve been in this league for a while and when my number is called, I try to execute.”
Terry McLaurin will bust out for a big game soon, but for all the offseason talk of Washington’s top receiver being Daniels’ favorite option in the passing game, it has not played out that way so far. Daniels through two games has thrown only 12 times to McLaurin, who has a total of eight catches for 39 yards.
McLaurin has surpassed 1,000 yards receiving in each of the past four seasons.
The Commanders are so healthy it is making for some tough lineup decisions. Linebacker Jamin Davis, a first-round pick in 2021, and safety Darrick Forrest, who emerged as a key player under the previous regime, were healthy scratches because Clelin Ferrell and Quan Martin were able to play after being listed as questionable.
5 — The number of times Daniels was sacked by the Giants, including a few times he tried to scramble to make a play but lost yards.

WACO, Texas (AP) — BYU safety Crew Wakley saw the ball once it was thrown into the air, even if he couldn’t really see the Baylor quarterback. The 22nd-ranked Cougars were still undefeated after he went up and caught it. 
“Shoutout to the D-line, they were all up in his face,” Wakley said. “It’s like a flyball. ... I knew as soon as it left his hand. I was like, I’ve got this, got to go make that play.”
Wakley’s leaping interception, near midfield right in front of the Baylor bench with 59 seconds left, finally clinched a 34-28 victory on Saturday. The Cougars never trailed but had to hold on after twice building three-touchdown leads before halftime when Jake Retzlaff threw for two scores and ran for another one.
“A little dramatic at the end there,” BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. “I’d like to see us finish business. ... But I was proud of the team, proud of the way the guys responded, their response to adversity and within the game, and their willingness to stick together. That was something special.”
The Cougars (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) got their first Big 12 road victory, and the defense came up big late after a turnover and then a quick three-and-out.
Retzlaff’s second pick after halftime was a deflection caught by 337-pound nose tackle Elinus Noel III to set up the Bears at the BYU 45 with 4:01 left. Baylor (2-3, 0-2) was stopped on a fourth-and-6 incompletion from the 24 with 1:47 left, but still had all of it timeouts and got the ball back with only 13 seconds coming off the clock while BYU went three-and-out.


“The way the guys finished, they were resilient to the end,” Retzlaff said. “That will get you a win with a fast start.”
Baylor was within 34-28 after Josh Cameron’s one toe-tapping 23-yard touchdown catch on the far side of the end zone with about 10 minutes left. Cameron had seven catches for 125 yards and two TDs.
Retzlaff was 13 of 17 passing for 180 yards and two touchdowns, and that didn’t count a behind-the-line pass to Chase Roberts that was ruled a 2-yard TD run, as the Cougars built a 31-14 halftime lead. They led 21-0 in the first quarter, and were up 28-7 with 9:32 left in the first half after a 44-yard TD by Darius Lassiter, who caught eight passes for 120 yards.
But Retzlaff was 4 of 14 for only 36 yards after the break.
Baylor’s Sawyer Robertson finished 27 of 48 passing for 324 yards. He had three touchdowns and threw two interceptions.
The Cougars led 7-0 only 6 1/2 minutes into the game. Baylor’s lone offensive snap at that point was a pass deflected straight up in the air by 290-pound nose tackle John Nelson and caught by defensive tackle Blake Mangelson.
BYU: The Cougars are 5-0 for the third time in five seasons, after reaching that mark only two others times (2001 and 2008) since their undefeated 1984 championship season. BYU was 2-7 in Big 12 play last year after playing as an independent the previous 12 seasons.
Baylor: Two weeks after ending a nine-game home losing streak against FBS teams with a 31-3 win over Air Force, the Bears lost their eighth consecutive conference home game since beating Kansas on Oct. 22, 2022.
The Bears a week earlier lost 38-31 in overtime at Colorado, when they missed a field goal late before the Buffaloes had a Hail Mary TD on the final play of regulation, then won when Baylor fumbled going into the end zone on its OT possession.
“Our second halves have been really good. Our offense has stepped up, our defense has stepped up. So, we know the kind of team that we are,” Baylor linebacker Caleb Parker said. “We’ve just got to start that way. We’ve got to start fast and just play like we are, play confident and trust that we can win. Because we can.”
The Cougars certainly will be ranked for a second week in a row. But they may not move up much, or at all, after having to go down to the wire instead of turning those big early leads into a lopsided victory.
BYU: Has an open date before hosting Big 12 newcomer Arizona on Oct. 12. 
Baylor: Plays at No. 18 Iowa State next Saturday night.

NEW YORK (AP) — President Joe Biden’s administration headed into the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders this week with high hopes that he could cement his legacy as an international statesman during escalating conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. 
Yet five days of frantic diplomacy focused mainly on preventing the Israel-Hezbollah crisis from exploding into a full-scale war has yielded little, if any, results — and prospects for peace have further dimmed.
Despite a proposal from the U.S., France and other allies for a temporary cease-fire along the border with Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the General Assembly, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home.
As Netanyahu spoke, Israel launched a massive strike on Hezbollah’s main headquarters in Beirut that targeted the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah. Netanyahu then cut short his already-truncated visit to New York and headed home without meeting U.S. officials.
“Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. The way it does so matters,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Friday, declining to outright criticize Israel for its latest strike. The Pentagon and the White House National Security Council said the U.S. did not get advance warning.
“We believe the way forward is through diplomacy not conflict. The path to diplomacy may seem difficult, as we see in this moment, but it is there,” Blinken said. 


Netanyahu’s speech and his abbreviated trip — which lacked any meetings with leaders from Israel’s largest and most important backer, the United States — underscored the limits of American influence. Many believe U.S. sway in the region has been waning since Israel’s war with Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, began nearly a year ago.
Critics of the administration’s handling of the growing Middle East conflict say Biden and his team now find themselves contending with an uncomfortable dynamic they created themselves: A split-screen in which top administration officials are pleading for a cease-fire as Israel continues to decisively go after top Hezbollah commanders that it blames for driving tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes near the border with Lebanon.
“On the same day the U.S. was begging Hezbollah for a cease-fire, Israel took out Hezbollah’s command center,” said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and a former National Security Council staffer on the Iran desk during the Trump administration. “The contrast brings the current state of American weakness into sharp relief.”
This week began with Biden’s top national security aides working to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. 
Blinken met with European and Gulf Arab foreign ministers, along with Netanyahu’s top strategic adviser, Ron Dermer. Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein, the White House’s chief interlocutors with Israel and Lebanon since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas launched the war in Gaza, held similar talks in New York to win support for the plan.
After three days of intense talks — punctuated by a brief spat between the United States and France over the timing — the proposal was presented late Wednesday.
The Americans were particularly perturbed by France calling an emergency U.N. Security Council session on Lebanon for Wednesday evening — at which the French foreign minister previewed the as-yet unfinished proposal — while at the same time Biden was hosting a reception for world leaders at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. That effectively forced the U.S. to unveil it before many officials believed it was ready.
Nearly four hours after that Security Council meeting began, the White House released the plan. U.S. officials then offered upbeat assessments of its prospects over the objections of some in the Biden administration who had urged caution, according to several people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to detail private discussions. 
After consulting with senior Israeli officials, Blinken and other diplomats had expected Israel to at least welcome, if not endorse, the plan. Instead, Netanyahu appeared to reject it when he arrived in New York on Thursday. He later clarified that Israel supports the goals of the cease-fire. 
Biden administration officials have been pressing for approval of the proposal since it was announced Wednesday night, but their hopes have waned since. No U.S. officials had contact with Netanyahu when he was in New York.
In his U.N. speech Friday, the Israeli leader castigated much of the world for trying to push his country into accepting an untenable situation along its northern border.
“We’ll continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met,” he told the General Assembly, just before reports emerged that Israeli had struck Hezbollah’s headquarters. “I’ve come here today to say: Enough is enough.”
Having returned to Washington on Wednesday night, Biden ordered the Pentagon on Friday “to assess and adjust as necessary U.S. force posture in the region to enhance deterrence, ensure force protection, and support the full range of U.S. objectives,” the White House said.

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Dan Lanning wasn’t about to be caught up in the historical significance of Oregon winning its first Big Ten game Saturday night.
That can come at another time. Instead, the Ducks’ coach wanted to discuss quarterback Dillon Gabriel and his team putting together another strong effort on both sides of the ball.
Gabriel threw three touchdown passes and moved up in the NCAA record books, while the defense didn’t allow an offensive touchdown as eighth-ranked Oregon rolled to a 34-13 victory over UCLA at the Rose Bowl.
“It was a complete game in a lot of ways,” Lanning said. “Dillon continues to prove that he’s a savvy quarterback. He did a good job of utilizing his feet when the first answer wasn’t there and moving on to the next look. The defense played their best game yet. After the first series we figured out their rhythm and what they were going to be doing.”
Tez Johnson had 11 receptions for 121 yards and two TDs as the Ducks (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) picked up their 12th victory in their last 13 meetings against the Bruins. 
Jordan James added 103 yards rushing and a touchdown on 20 carries.
Oregon took control in the first half as it scored on its first five possessions. After UCLA got a field goal on its opening drive to get to 7-3, the Ducks’ defense forced a turnover and three straight three-and-outs on the next four series and held the Bruins to minus-8 yards in the second quarter.


All of that results in the Ducks being unbeaten after four games for the second straight year, and third since 2015.
UCLA (1-3, 0-2) has dropped three straight in DeShaun Foster’s first season as coach. It is the first time since 1963 the Bruins have not scored at least 20 points in any of their first four games.
“Just like I told them, there’s not many words that are going to change this. It’s our actions. Actions speak louder than words,” Foster said. “We’ve got to change our actions out there on the field, and hopefully that’ll fix some stuff.”
Gabriel — who completed 31 of 41 passes for 280 yards — became the fourth Football Bowl Subdivision player to reach 16,000 yards passing for his career and moved into a three-way tie for third with 134 touchdown passes.
The sixth-year senior has 16,059 yards in 54 games at three different schools. He played parts of three seasons at UCF before transferring to Oklahoma, where he played in 2022 and ’23. Gabriel decided to play his final year at Oregon because the Hawaii native wanted to play closer to home.
“I’m trusting the guys. When you get the ball in the playmakers hands they make plays,” Gabriel said. “The trust and belief are there but more importantly guys are elite with what they did.”
Gabriel’s best pass came midway through the second quarter when he connected with Johnson for a 52-yard touchdown to make it 25-3. Johnson blew past UCLA’s coverage, caught the ball at the 10 and went untouched into the end zone.
Johnson then had a 12-yard grab near the back of the end zone early in the fourth quarter to make it 34-13. It is the second time this season and sixth in his career that the senior has had double-digit catches.
“I see confidence, poise and trust in his teammates,” Johnson said. “When you have a quarterback like that back there it is comfortable as a receiver to run each play.”
Gabriel’s other touchdown pass came on Oregon’s opening possession of Big Ten play when Traeshon Johnson’s reception for 11 yards capped an 11-play, 75-yard series.
Gabriel’s only mistake came late in the second quarter when Bryan Addison had a 96-yard pick six to get the Bruins to 28-10 at halftime. It was the first interception return TD for Addison, who began his career at Oregon.
Bruins quarterback Ethan Garbers was 12 of 20 for 118 yards and two interceptions. The senior was sacked four times and left the game during the fourth quarter with what appeared to be an ankle injury.
“If you know Ethan, you know he was fighting to stay out there. So when you have a player that’s begging to stay out there and he wanted to keep playing, we’re gonna let him play,” Foster said.
Oregon: While most of the attention goes to the offense, the defense continues to be stout. The Ducks have sacked opposing quarterbacks 11 times and is allowing only 154.8 passing yards per game.
UCLA: The Bruins’ offense under first-year coordinator Eric Bieniemy has gone six quarters since it last reached the end zone. 
Oregon should move up at least one spot after sixth-ranked Mississippi’s loss to Kentucky.
Oregon: Welcomes Michigan State on Friday night in the Ducks’ first Big Ten home game. 
UCLA: Travels to ninth-ranked Penn State in what will be a 9 a.m. PDT kickoff on Saturday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — California firefighters had to douse a flaming battery in a Tesla Semi with about 50,000 gallons (190,000 liters) of water to extinguish flames after a crash, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.
In addition to the huge amount of water, firefighters used an aircraft to drop fire retardant on the “immediate area” of the electric truck as a precautionary measure, the agency said in a preliminary report.
Firefighters said previously that the battery reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (540 Celsius) while it was in flames.
The NTSB sent investigators to the Aug. 19 crash along Interstate 80 near Emigrant Gap, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento. The agency said it would look into fire risks posed by the truck’s large lithium-ion battery. 
The agency also found that the truck was not operating on one of Tesla’s partially automated driving systems at the time of the crash, the report said. The systems weren’t operational and “could not be engaged,” according to the agency.
The crash happened about 3:13 a.m. as the tractor-trailer was being driven by a Tesla employee from Livermore, California, to a Tesla facility in Sparks, Nevada. The Semi left the road while going around a curve to the right and hit a tree, the report said. It went down a slope and came to rest against several trees. The driver was not hurt. 
After the crash, the Semi’s lithium-ion battery ignited. Firefighters used water to put out flames and keep the batteries cool. The freeway was closed for about 15 hours as firefighters made sure the batteries were cool enough to recover the truck.

Take a look at more Notable Numbers here.

Authorities took the truck to an open-air facility and monitored it for 24 hours. The battery did not reignite. 


The NTSB said all aspects of the crash are under investigation as it determines the cause. The agency said it intends to issue safety recommendations to prevent similar incidents.
A message was left Thursday seeking comment from Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas.
After an investigation that ended in 2021, the NTSB determined that high-voltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that guidelines from manufacturers about how to deal with them were inadequate.
The agency, which has no enforcement powers and can only make recommendations, called for manufacturers to write vehicle-specific response guides for fighting battery fires and limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition. The guidelines also should include information on how to safely store vehicles with damaged lithium-ion batteries, the agency said.
Tesla began delivering the electric Semis in December of 2022, more than three years after CEO Elon Musk said his company would start making the trucks. Musk has said the Semi has a range per charge of 500 miles (800 kilometers) when pulling an 82,000-pound (37,000-kilo) load.",False

WASHINGTON (AP) — Stone Garrett homered in his first major league plate appearance in more than a year in a three-hit, three-RBI effort and the Washington Nationals ended a four-game losing streak with a 9-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday night.
Luis García Jr., Juan Yepez and Jacob Young each had three hits and Keibert Ruiz drove in three for Washington, which beat Philadelphia for only the third time in 11 meetings this season. It was the most runs the Nationals have scored in a game since scoring nine at Baltimore on Aug. 13.
Washington’s Trevor Williams (6-1) struck out five in five shutout innings and allowed three hits and two walks as he lowered his ERA to 2.03 over 13 starts.
Ranger Suárez (12-8) closed his regular season by allowing six runs in two innings for Philadelphia, which has already clinched the NL East and a playoff bye.
“He wasn’t the only one who was rough tonight,” Philadelphia manager Rob Thomson said. “It wasn’t vintage Phillie baseball, that’s for sure.”
The Phillies fell two games the behind the Los Angeles Dodgers for the top seed in the National League. The Dodgers beat Colorado 11-4 on Friday night.
The 28-year-old Garrett hadn’t played in the majors since breaking his left leg while trying to rob the New York Yankees’ DJ LeMahieu of a home run on Aug. 23, 2023. He was recalled from Triple-A Rochester on Tuesday and didn’t play in three games against Kansas City before serving as the designated hitter against the left-handed Suárez.


With Washington already up 1-0 on Yepez’s RBI single, Garrett ripped a 72 mph curveball 431 feet into the left-field seats that brought in Yepez. Garrett yelled as he approached first base as part of a gleeful trip around the bases.
“It was all released before I touched first base,” Garrett said. “I don’t even know the word to describe it, but rounding the bases, I blacked out. You’re rehabbing, trying to get back to where I was before I got injured, just being able to compete at the level I knew I could compete at. It was pent-up emotions.”
Suárez also gave up Young’s RBI single while throwing 42 pitches in the first inning. Ruiz added a two-run single in the second.
Suárez, who earned his first All-Star appearance this year, is 2-3 with a 5.74 ERA in seven starts since returning from a back injury Aug. 24.
“I’m not concerned about his health, but the stuff was down tonight,” Thomson said. “I think everyone saw that. I think the last two years, the final start of his season wasn’t very good, kind of similar to this. Maybe he needs a little bit of time off, which he’ll get, and then pick it up with adrenaline in the playoffs.”
Garrett made it 7-0 with a run-scoring single off Tyler Gilbert in the fourth. He also doubled off José Ruiz to lead off the seventh.
“I’m so happy for him,” Washington manager Dave Martinez said. “He worked really hard to get back. For him to go out there and do what he did today was amazing.”
Philadelphia’s Austin Hays homered off Tanner Rainey in the eighth.
Nationals: Washington recalled RHP Jackson Rutledge from and optioned LHP DJ Herz to the team’s Florida Complex League affiliate.
Philadelphia RHP Zack Wheeler (16-7, 2.56 ERA), who is 2-0 with a 2.03 ERA in two starts against Washington this season, faces Nationals LHP MacKenzie Gore (10-12, 4.04) on Saturday.

IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Kaleb Johnson rushed for 173 yards and two touchdowns as Iowa rallied in the second half for a 38-21 win over Troy on Saturday.
It was the third consecutive 100-yard rushing game to start the season for Johnson, who came into the game ranked third nationally at 153 yards per game.
“That’s one thing I’ve always had in mind — to be a top-five running back in the nation,” Johnson said. “I’ve got to keep going, keep my head down, keep focusing.”
Johnson has 479 yards on 61 carries this season, even after missing the first half of the season opener against Illinois State as punishment for violation of team rules. Johnson, who had just 463 yards last season after missing three games with an injury, has already matched his single-season high with six touchdowns this season.
“I’ve seen a ton of improvement from him in the last month,” tackle Mason Richman said. “I think he had one of the best camps of anyone on the team. He brings that energy. He’s a big guy, but he’s pretty fast, too.”
“I learned a lot my first two years here,” Johnson said. “I was so used to using my speed on people, because that’s all I was in high school. Now it’s just me knowing people are faster. Now it’s just me using my strength, putting my head down.”
Johnson opened the scoring with a 4-yard touchdown run on Iowa’s first possession then his 33-yard touchdown run with 12:05 left in the game gave the Hawkeyes a 31-21 lead.


The Hawkeyes (2-1) were able to shake off the Trojans (0-3), who got three big scoring plays from receiver Devonte Ross.
Ross gave Troy a 14-10 halftime lead with a 63-yard touchdown reception from Matthew Caldwell early in the second quarter along with a 77-yard punt return for a touchdown with one minute left in the half.
Ross caught a 62-yard touchdown from Tucker Kilcrease in the third quarter.
Ross finished the game with 219 all-purpose yards.
Johnson’s second score was one of four second-half touchdowns for the Hawkeyes. Addison Ostrenga caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Brendan Sullivan, and Jermari Harris returned an interception 28 yards for another touchdown. Jaziun Patterson closed the scoring with a 39-yard touchdown run with 6:01 left in the game.
“When you play Big Ten football teams like Iowa, they laid on us, pounded us, completed a drive and got it back to 10 (points),” Troy coach Gerad Parker said. “We wore down and they beat us up a little bit as the game went on. But our guys fought their tails off.”
Iowa had 462 yards of offense, including 284 rushing yards.
“We put up a lot of yards in the first half,” quarterback Cade McNamara said. “The scoreboard just didn’t reflect it. I think our ability to respond is a good sign.”
“I saw a lot of good things out there today, really encouraging,” coach Kirk Ferentz said. “But there are some things we can hopefully do better as we move forward.”
Troy was playing without injured starting quarterback Goose Crowder. Caldwell started the game, completing 14 of 21 passes for 156 yards, while Kilcrease was 2 of 5 for 73 yards.
McNamara was 19-of-23 passing for 176 yards. McNamara had nine consecutive completions during one stretch.
Troy: The Trojans, who opened the season with a close home loss to Nevada and a 21-point road loss to Memphis, showed improvement in the third game under Parker. “It’s tremendous growth,” Ross said. “You’ve got to play games to build chemistry. This game, it showed us who we are and what we can do.”
Iowa: The Hawkeyes fell out of the AP poll after last week’s loss to Iowa State, but this didn’t feel like the kind of win that can get them back into the rankings. Iowa’s mistake-free offense wore down the Trojans in the second half, allowing the Hawkeyes to rally from the first-half deficit.
Troy: Hosts Florida A&M next Saturday.
Iowa: At Minnesota next Saturday.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Barcelona coach Hansi Flick says he’s confident that Iñaki Peña can remain the team’s starting goalkeeper in the absence of the injured Marc-André ter Stegen.
Flick said Tuesday the club is not under pressure to replace Ter Stegen after he sustained a serious knee injury that will sideline him for several months.
“Iñaki is doing really well,” Flick said ahead of the team’s home match against Getafe in the Spanish league on Wednesday. “He’s absolutely a professional goalkeeper, he trained very hard for that. For a second goalkeeper it’s always difficult to be focused, but what I can see is that he is absolutely focused and he is absolutely ready to play.”
Ter Stegen, one of the team’s captains and Barcelona’s long-time starter, sustained a complete rupture of a tendon in his right knee during the team’s 5-1 win at Villarreal on Sunday.
“I feel truly grateful to all the Barça fans, teammates, rivals, clubs and friends for the support and love you’ve shown me since Sunday,” he said on Instagram. “I want to thank the Villarreal supporters for their respect displayed in the stadium, it means a lot to me. I feel positive and strong, now I focus on my recovery.”
Flick said Barcelona will look into the market to add a new goalkeeper “because there are very young goalkeepers behind” the 25-year-old Peña.
“We have to see what we are doing, we will talk later,” Flick said. “But we are not under pressure, we are really confident with Iñaki.”


The 32-year-old Ter Stegen had started all seven of the team’s games this season. His appearance against Villarreal was his 289th with the club and took him past legendary Antoni Ramallets into third place on the club’s all-time list of appearances for goalkeepers.
Barcelona is off to a perfect start in the Spanish league by winning all six games so far.

Publication date:2024-09-28 01:26:00

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — After a day filled with hopes of a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, the U.N. General Assembly meeting Friday was a harsh reality check. 
Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU shut down the idea in a morning speech that he said he didn’t initially intend to make. He said he had not planned to come to the meeting this year, because his country is at war, but “after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight.”
The week has been full of speakers calling for a cease-fire in both Lebanon and Gaza, continuing into Friday. But Netanyahu wasn’t swayed. He said his nation will “continue degrading Hezbollah” until achieving its goals along the Lebanon border, and would no longer tolerate daily rocket fire from the area. Shortly after Netanyahu wrapped up his speech, the Israeli military said it carried out a strike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut, which caused huge blasts in the city. 
Here’s your daily guide to what’s going on at the United Nations this week:
MORE ANTI-WAR: Calls for Israel to stop its war in Gaza and back off from a growing conflict in Lebanon continued. The two speakers who preceded Netanyahu each made a point of calling out Israel for its actions. “Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,” Slovenian Prime Minister ROBERT GOLOB said as he closed his remarks, pounding the podium. And Pakistani Prime Minister SHEHBAZ SHARIF, speaking just before the Israeli leader, declared of Gaza: “This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.” He thumped the rostrum to audible applause.
PROMISE FOR DEMOCRACY: Tanzania Prime Minister KASSIM MAJALIWA pledged that his country will uphold democracy and human rights ahead of next year’s presidential election. An opposition party official was killed in early September and two main opposition leaders were arrested among a dozen other opposition politicians while planning a youth rally and during protests against recent killing and arrest of opposition officials and members. President SAMIA SULUHU has condemned the killing of the opposition official Ali Kibao and promised justice. She’s serving out the term of the late President JOHN MAGUFULI, whose autocratic rule saw the ban on political rallies and detention of opposition leaders.


POETRY IN POLICY: As Pakistan tries to climb out of an economic crisis, Sharif turned Friday to poetry to convey his country’s resolve. Addressing world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, he read aloud part of “Keep Going,” a 1921 piece by American poet Edgar A. Guest. It begins “When things go wrong, as they sometimes will” — when, for example, “the funds are low and the debts are high.” (Sharif substituted “credits” for “funds.”) Pakistan’s debts are indeed substantial. The International Monetary Fund this week approved a $7 billion loan for the nation, which plunged into one of the worst economic crises in its history after flooding in 2022. Sharif’s government raised electricity prices, saying the hike was necessary to meet conditions of the new loan. The increase spurred protests and a merchants’ strike. Sharif told the assembly that his government has “taken some very difficult but necessary decisions that have rescued our economy from collapse.” Then he brought up the poem, saying it had bucked him up. He went through a stanza that ends: “When care is pressing you down a bit, / Rest if you must, but don’t you quit.” “This,” Sharif told the assembly, “is how we have learned to face our challenges and negotiate the most daunting challenges that we have faced.”
CUBA COMMENTS: For decades Cuba’s primary foreign-policy priority has been ending the U.S. trade embargo on the island. The country dedicates much of its General Assembly diplomacy to getting leaders to decry the embargo. According to Cuba’s U.N. mission, by 3:41 p.m. on Friday 25 countries had addressed the embargo at this year’s UNGA and 11 leaders had critiqued the U.S. inclusion of Cuba on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism, another sanction limiting international trade. Many of the countries that spoke have benefitted from another of Cuba’s trademark programs, sending its well-trained and highly educated doctors to developing countries across the world. Right after mentioning Ukraine and Gaza, Prime Minister ALLAH MAYE HALINA of Chad told the world that “we can’t ignore the embargo on Cuba, which hurts its people and hinders its development.”
Norwegian Foreign Minister ESPEN BARTH EIDE, who was in the General Assembly hall listening to Netanyahu, called his address “a rather dark speech” that was “very defiant.” Norway recognized the State of Palestine in May. Eide said there are many countries that would like to support Israel and normalize relations, including Saudi Arabia and others in region, “but they are not able to do that as long as the Palestinian question remains unanswered.”
FUNDRAISERS, ADVOCATES: As the meeting of world leaders unfolds at the United Nations, a crush of events take place on the sidelines of the official high-level meetings, where nonprofits, advocates and fundraisers mingle and lobby world leaders, billionaires and funders — and plan their next steps with each other. A few examples: On Sunday, throngs of people streamed through a “climate science fair ” showcasing work on nature, food and the energy transition, held across Manhattan on an elevated park that runs along old rail lines. On Monday, the BILL & MELINDA GATES Foundation held a ceremony featuring Grammy-winning musician JON BATISTE performing in a gold sequin suit, and honoring Brazilian PRESIDENT LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DA SILVA for his work lifting millions out of poverty and significantly reducing malnutrition among children.
Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, JAMES MARAPE, told the General Assembly that accessing money to fight climate change has been a challenge. “It is for this reason I speak in solidarity with all forest nations, especially those in the Congo Basin and Amazon Basin, for adequate compensation if we are to preserve our forests which, in fact, are the lungs of Earth,” Marape said.
“It is regrettable that the Republic of China, Taiwan, continues to be excluded from the United Nations system.”
—FELETI PENITALA TEO, prime minister of Tuvalu
Ugandan Prime Minister NABBANJA ROBINAH asked the assembly why the U.N. has failed to forge stronger international cooperation in response to collective global challenges. “Urgent action is required to address global inequalities with regard to poverty, hunger and disease which continue to affect disproportionally the poorest and most vulnerable,” she said. 
If you’re following along and confused by all the strange words, take a look at our brief vocabulary of U.N. terms.
The largest number of police and troops sent by a country to U.N. peacekeeping missions this year, from Nepal: 6,119
“Even the strongest swimmer drowns if left alone in a raging sea. ”
— Bahamas Prime Minister PHILIP DAVIS
“We believe the ‘monsoon revolution’ that the world witnessed in Bangladesh in the span of few weeks may inspire many across communities and countries to stand for freedom and justice. I would call upon the international community to engage with ‘new Bangladesh’ anew that aims to realize freedom and democracy, beyond letters, for everyone.”

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Sam Darnold and the Minnesota Vikings keep proving skeptics wrong while maintaining early control of the NFC North race.
Darnold threw three touchdown passes and Jordan Addison scored twice as the undefeated Vikings built an early 28-point lead and hung on down the stretch to beat the Green Bay Packers 31-29 on Sunday.
Picked by many to finish last in the NFC North, the Vikings (4-0) are off to their best start since 2016, when they won their first five games before slumping to an 8-8 finish. They’ve trailed for less than 3 1/2 minutes all season.
“At the end of the day, we believe in each other more than anyone else believes in us,” Darnold said.
Minnesota spoiled the return of Packers quarterback Jordan Love, who returned after missing two games with an injured left medial collateral ligament. He threw for 389 yards and four touchdowns, both career highs. But he also matched a career high with three interceptions while going 32 of 54.
“We fought the whole game and started making plays later, but too little, too late,” Love said.
Green Bay (2-2) got within 31-29 on Dontayvion Wicks’ second fourth-quarter touchdown catch — a 17-yarder with 56 seconds left. Minnesota’s Josh Oliver recovered Daniel Whelan’s ensuing onside kick — it actually was a drop kick — to secure the victory.
Darnold was 20 of 28 for 275 yards with touchdown passes of 29 yards to Addison, 2 yards to Oliver and 14 yards to Justin Jefferson. He also threw an interception and lost a fumble.


Addison, who had missed Minnesota’s last two games with an ankle injury, also scored on a 7-yard run.
Former Packers running back Aaron Jones had 22 carries for 93 yards and four catches for 46 yards in his return to Lambeau Field. Jones spent seven seasons with Green Bay before getting released and signing with the Vikings in March.

Jones had said he would do a “Lambeau leap” into the stands if he scored a touchdown. Jones never reached the end zone Sunday, but he still leaped into a section of Vikings fans in the stands on his way to the locker room after the game.
“As we were taking that last kneel, the Packers defense, they’re like, ‘Ahh, we didn’t let you Lambeau leap here. We didn’t let you Lambeau leap in our house,’” Jones said. “I’m like, ‘You guys are worried about me Lambeau leaping? You guys should be worried about the score.’ I came here and got what I wanted. But I did get my Lambeau leap in, so I got a two-for-one.”
Jayden Reed had seven receptions for 139 yards and a touchdown for the Packers.
The game featured seven turnovers — four by Green Bay and three by Minnesota.
Minnesota capitalized on two interceptions by Love and a pair of missed field goal attempts from Brayden Narveson to built its 28-0 lead in the first 25 minutes. It was the Vikings’ highest-scoring first half since 2017, when they scored 28 before halftime and beat Washington 38-30.
“This is a humbling league at times,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. “Credit to them. They did more than we did to win the game. We’ve got to bounce back from it. We’ve got to learn from it and get better.”
Minnesota scored on each of its first three possessions as Darnold picked apart a Green Bay secondary missing injured cornerbacks Jaire Alexander and Carrington Valentine. When the Packers finally forced a punt, Shaq Griffin delivered a 28-yard interception return to set up one more Vikings touchdown.
The Vikings led 28-7 and had second-and-1 from the Green Bay 20 in the third quarter when Xavier McKinney picked off Darnold, becoming the first Packer to intercept a pass in each of his first four games with the team.
That helped Green Bay creep back into the game.
Love threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Wicks and a 13-yarder to Tucker Kraft to cut Minnesota’s lead to 28-22 with 10:16 remaining. Minnesota regrouped on its next possession, with a couple of completions to Jefferson setting up Will Reichard’s 33-yard kick with 6:50 left.
The Packers got one last chance after Minnesota’s Jalen Nailor was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1 from the Green Bay 4 with less than 2 1/2 minutes left. Love engineered a quick 96-yard drive to cut the margin to two.
But the Packers will continue staring up at the surprising Vikings in the NFC North standings.
“I know what we have in this room is special,” said Byron Murphy, who had one of the Vikings’ three interceptions. “So all that outside noise, I keep saying, ‘Stay off the (band)wagon. Don’t try to jump on it now. You all can stay over there, whatever you all do, but we’re going to keep this thing going.’”
Packers WR Christian Watson was carted off the field after injuring an ankle on the play that resulted in an interception. “I have talked to Christian, and he told me that he thought it was just a sprain,” LaFleur said. ... Packers DL Devonte Wyatt hurt an ankle in the fourth quarter.

TOKYO (AP) — Olympic sponsor Panasonic is terminating its contract with the IOC at the end of the year, the company said in a statement Tuesday.
Panasonic is one of 15 companies that are so-called TOP sponsors for the International Olympic Committee. It’s not known the value of the Panasonic sponsorship, but sponsors contribute more than $2 billion in a four-year cycle to the IOC.
In a statement, Panasonic said it became an IOC sponsor in 1987 and expanded to the Paralympics in 2014. It did not make clear why it was changing course and said only that is was related to continual “reviews how sponsorship should evolve.”
Two other Japanese companies are also among the IOC’s 15 leading sponsors. Toyota, which for several months has been reportedly ready to end its contract, was contacted Tuesday by The Associated Press but offered no new information.
“Toyota has been supporting the Olympic and Paralympic movements since 2015 and continues to do so,” Toyota said in a statement. “No announcement to suggest otherwise has been made by Toyota.”
Japanese sponsors seem to have turned away from the Olympics, likely related to the one-year delay in holding the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The COVID-19 delay reduced sponsors’ visibility with no fans allowed to attend competition venues, ran up the costs, and unearthed myriad corruption scandals around the Games.
Tiremaker Bridgestone told AP “nothing has been decided.”


Toyota had a contact valued at $835 million — reported to be the IOC’s largest when it was announced in 2015. It included four Olympics beginning with the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Games in South Korea and ran through the just-completed Paris Olympics and Paralympics.
Reports in Japan suggest Toyota may keep its Paralympic Olympic sponsorship.
The IOC TOP sponsors are: ABInBev, Airbnb, Alibaba, Allianz, Atos, Bridgestone, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, Intel, Omega, Panasonic, P&G, Samsung, Toyoto, and Visa.
In a report several months ago by the Japanese news agency Kyodo, unnamed sources said Toyota was unhappy with how the IOC uses sponsorship money. It said the money was “not used effectively to support athletes and promote sports.”
Japan was once a major font of revenue, but increasingly the IOC has sought out sponsors from China, with increasing interest from the Middle East and India.
“We would love to welcome a first new TOP sponsor from India and I am sure that this is going to happen very, very soon,” the IOC’s marketing director, Anne-Sophie Voumard, said last month at the Paris Olympics.
“It’s a very, very dynamic program,” Voumard said on Aug. 7 of the TOP slate, adding “partners come and go depending on their business strategy.”
Japan officially spent $13 billion on the Tokyo Olympics, at least half of which was public money. A government audit suggested the real cost was twice that. The IOC contribution was about $1.8 billion.
The Tokyo Games were mired in corruption scandals linked to local sponsorships and the awarding of contracts. Dentsu Inc, the huge Japanese marketing and public relations company, was the marketing arm of the Tokyo Olympics and raised a record-$3.3 billion in local sponsorship money. This is separate from TOP sponsors.
French prosecutors also looked into alleged vote-buying in the IOC’s decision in 2013 to pick Tokyo as the host for the 2020 Summer Games.
The IOC had income of $7.6 billion in the last four-year cycle ending with the Tokyo Games. Figures have not been released yet for the cycle ending with the Paris Olympics.
The IOC’s TOP sponsors paid over $2 billion in that period. The figure is expected to reach $3 billion in the next cycle.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has identified what he sees as an all-purpose fix for what ails America: Slap huge new tariffs on foreign goods entering the United States.
The former president and current Republican nominee asserts that tariffs — basically import taxes — will create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices and allow the government to subsidize childcare.
He even says tariffs can promote world peace.
“Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,’’ Trump said this month in Flint, Michigan.
As president, Trump imposed tariffs with a flourish — targeting imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China.
“Tariff Man,” he called himself.
This time, he’s gone much further: He has proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China — and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports.
This week, he raised the ante still higher. To punish the machinery manufacturer John Deere for its plans to move some production to Mexico, Trump vowed to tax anything Deere tried to export back into the United States — at 200%.
And he threatened to hit Mexican-made goods with 100% tariffs, a move that would risk blowing up a trade deal that Trump’s own administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico.
Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity. They are especially alarmed by Trump’s latest proposed tariffs.


This week, a report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump’s main tariff proposals – assuming that the targeted countries retaliated with their own tariffs — would slash more than a percentage point off the U.S. economy by 2026 and make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.
Vice President Kamala Harris has dismissed Trump’s tariff threats as unserious. Her campaign has cited a report that found that Trump’s 20% universal tariff would cost a typical family nearly $4,000 a year.
But the Biden-Harris administration itself has a taste for tariffs. It retained the taxes Trump imposed on $360 billion in Chinese goods. And it imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.
Indeed, the United States in recent years has gradually retreated from its post-World War II role of promoting global free trade and lower tariffs. That shift has been a response to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, widely attributed to unfettered tree trade and an increasingly aggressive China.
They are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country.
The tariff rates range from passenger cars (2.5%) to golf shoes (6%). Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump’s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
Trump insists that tariffs are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, its is importers — American companies — that pay tariffs, and the money goes to U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That’s why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs.
What to know about the 2024 Election
Still, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Yang Zhou, an economist at Shanghai’s Fudan University, concluded in a study that Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods inflicted more than three times as much damage to the Chinese economy as they did to the U.S. economy
By raising the price of imports, tariffs can protect home-grown manufacturers. They may also serve to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices, like subsidizing their exporters or dumping products at unfairly low prices.
Before the federal income tax was established in 1913, tariffs were a major revenue driver for the government. From 1790 to 1860, tariffs accounted for 90% of federal revenue, according to Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who has studied the history of trade policy.
Tariffs fell out of favor as global trade grew after World War II. The government needed vastly bigger revenue streams to finance its operations.
In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the government is expected to collect $81.4 billion in tariffs and fees. That’s a trifle next to the $2.5 trillion that’s expected to come from individual income taxes and the $1.7 trillion from Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Still, Trump wants to enact a budget policy that resembles what was in place in the 19th century.
He has argued that tariffs on farm imports could lower food prices by aiding America’s farmers. In fact, tariffs on imported food products would almost certainly send grocery prices up by reducing choices for consumers and competition for American producers.
Tariffs can also be used to pressure other countries on issues that may or may not be related to trade. In 2019, for example, Trump used the threat of tariffs as leverage to persuade Mexico to crack down on waves of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory on their way to the United States.
Trump even sees tariffs as a way to prevent wars.
“I can do it with a phone call,’’ he said at an August rally in North Carolina.
If another country tries to start a war, he said he’d issue a threat:
“We’re going to charge you 100% tariffs. And all of a sudden, the president or prime minister or dictator or whoever the hell is running the country says to me, ‘Sir, we won’t go to war.’ ”
Tariffs raise costs for companies and consumers that rely on imports. They’re also likely to provoke retaliation.
The European Union, for example, punched back against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing U.S. products, from bourbon to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Likewise, China responded to Trump’s trade war by slapping tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork in a calculated drive to hurt his supporters in farm country.
A study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump’s tariffs failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs “neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment’’ where they were supposed to protect jobs, the study found.
Despite Trump’s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for example, the number of jobs at U.S. steel plants barely budged: They remained right around 140,000. By comparison, Walmart alone employs 1.6 million people in the United States.
Worse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had “negative employment impacts,’’ especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump doled out to farmers. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on targeted imports.
If Trump’s trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. The study found that support for Trump and Republican congressional candidates rose in areas most exposed to the import tariffs — the industrial Midwest and manufacturing-heavy Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee.",False

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel is preparing for a possible ground operation in Lebanon, its army chief said Wednesday as Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets across the border and a missile aimed at Tel Aviv that was the militant group’s deepest strike yet.
Addressing troops on the northern border, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said Israel’s punishing airstrikes this week were designed to ”prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.”
The U.S., France and other allies jointly called for an “immediate” 21-day cease-fire in the conflict that has killed more than 600 people to “provide space for diplomacy.” 


Their joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, said the fighting was “intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.” Other signatories include the European Union, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
Israel says it targeted Hezbollah weapons and rocket launchers. In an apparent reference to the missile fired at Tel Aviv, Halevi told troops: “Today, Hezbollah expanded its range of fire, and later today, they will receive a very strong response. Prepare yourselves.”
It was not clear whether he was referring to a ground operation, airstrikes or some other form of retaliation against Hezbollah, which is Lebanon’s strongest political force and, with backing from Iran, is widely considered the top paramilitary group in the Arab world. 


The Israeli military has said in recent days it had no immediate plans for a ground invasion, but Halevi’s comments were the strongest yet suggesting troops could move in. Israeli said Wednesday it would activate two reserve brigades for missions in the north — another sign that Israel plans tougher action.
Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have steadily escalated since war broke out 11 months ago between Israel and Hamas, another Iran-backed militant group. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and Hamas. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation.
Nearly a year of fighting had already displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before the recent escalation.

Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, something that appears increasingly remote.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israel and Hezbollah to step back, saying all-out war would be disastrous for the region and its people.
Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the U.N. Security Council to act immediately “to guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Lebanese territories and the violations that are repeated on a daily basis.”
Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters at the U.N. that Israel welcomes initiatives to broker a cease-fire and is “open to ideas.” But if diplomacy doesn’t stop Hezbollah attacks so residents of northern Israel can return home, he said, his country would “use all means at our disposal, in accordance with international law, to achieve our aims.”
Lebanon’s health ministry said 72 people were killed Wednesday in the continuing Israeli strikes, raising the death toll from the past three days to 636, with more than 2,000 wounded. At least a quarter of those killed have been women and children, according to Lebanese health officials.

At Dar Al Amal hospital in the eastern city of Baalbek, Soumaya Moussawi lay in bed with her head bandaged and face bruised.
She had been sitting outside with relatives when warplanes started striking in the distance, she said.
“Then suddenly it hit next to us. We were all thrown in different directions,” she said. Two cousins and her father were killed, and another cousin was badly wounded. 
This week has been the deadliest in Lebanon since the bruising 2006 monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah.
Hezbollah said it fired a Qader 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, which it blames for a recent string of targeted killings of its top commanders and for an attack last week in which explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands, including many Hezbollah members.
Israeli military officials said they intercepted a surface-to-surface missile that set off air-raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel. There were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it struck the launch site in southern Lebanon.
Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said the missile fired Wednesday had a “heavy warhead” but declined to elaborate or confirm it was the type described by Hezbollah. He dismissed Hezbollah’s claim of targeting the Mossad headquarters just north of Tel Aviv as “psychological warfare.”
The Israeli military said it was the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have targeted an intelligence base near Tel Aviv last month in an aerial attack, but there was no confirmation. Hamas repeatedly targeted Tel Aviv in the opening months of the war in Gaza.
The launch ratcheted up hostilities in a region that appeared to be teetering toward another all-out war, even as Israel continues to battle Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Israel said Wednesday its air force had struck some 280 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon by early afternoon, including launchers used to fire rockets on the northern Israeli cities of Safed and Nahariya.
In the southern Israeli city of Eilat, a building at the port was struck by a drone, an attack that injured two people and was claimed by an umbrella group for Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. A second drone was intercepted, the Israeli military said.
Fleeing families have flocked to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, sleeping in schools turned into shelters, as well as in cars, parks and along the beach. Some sought to leave the country, causing a traffic jam at the border with Syria.
AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports how citizens are helping out in Beirut to help feed the large numbers displaced by recent Israeli attacks.
The United Nations said more than 90,000 people have been displaced by five days of Israeli strikes. In all, 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel nearly a year ago, drawing Israeli retaliation, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Hezbollah’s latest strikes included dozens of rockets fired Wednesday into northern Israel, the military said.
Rocket fire over the past week has disrupted life for more than 1 million people across northern Israel, with schools closed and public gatherings restricted. Many restaurants and other businesses are shut in the coastal city of Haifa, and there are fewer people on the streets. Some who fled from communities near the border are coming under rocket fire again.
Israel has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel.
Cross-border fire began ramping up Sunday after pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah were attacked remotely, killing 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility.
The next day, Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. The strikes racked up the highest one-day death toll in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006.

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street closed its latest winning month and quarter with more records on Monday. The drift higher for U.S. stocks followed a wild start to the week for financial markets in Asia, where Japanese stocks tumbled and Chinese indexes soared.
The S&P 500 climbed 0.4% to an all-time high and clinched its fifth straight winning month and fourth straight winning quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 17 points, or less than 0.1%, to its record set on Friday. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4%.
Wall Street has catapulted to records on hopes the slowing U.S. economy can keep growing  while the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates  to offer it more juice. A big test will arrive Friday, when the U.S. government offers its latest monthly update on the job market.
An overriding worry on Wall Street is whether the economy may already be heading for a recession. Even though the Fed cut rates earlier this month and has indicated more relief is on the way, U.S. employers have already begun paring back on their hiring. Before this month, the Fed had kept interest rates at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy  enough to stamp out high inflation. 
Stocks are holding close to records. More from AP’s Seth Sutel. 
“Payrolls remain the biggest catalyst” for the U.S. stock market until the election, strategists and economists at Bank of America wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
At Goldman Sachs, economist David Mericle said he’s expecting Friday’s report to show hiring in September was stronger than the 146,000 growth in payrolls that economists across Wall Street were broadly forecasting. 


In the past, a stronger-than-expected number could have hurt the stock market by fanning worries about upward pressure on inflation. Now, though, it would likely be welcomed as a signal that a recession shouldn’t be as big a worry.
Interest rates and the strength of the economy are usually the two main levers that set prices for stocks. In Asia, the levers were pulling in opposite directions.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 4.8% on worries the country’s incoming prime minister will support higher interest rates and other policies that investors see as less market-friendly. Shigeru Ishiba is set to take over on Tuesday.
Ishiba has expressed support for the Bank of Japan’s move to pull interest rates away  from their near-zero level, which puts upward pressure on the value of the Japanese yen. A stronger yen can hurt profits for Japanese exporters, which make sales in other currencies and then convert them back into yen. 
Toyota Motor’s stock fell 7.6% in Tokyo, while Honda Motor’s dropped 7%. Monday.
Stellantis, the company that owns the Jeep brand and others, tumbled 14.7% in Milan after cutting its forecast for upcoming profit. It cited investments to turn around its U.S. operations and increased Chinese competition. 
That in turn helped drag down automakers Ford Motor and General Motors on Wall Street. Ford fell 2%, and GM dropped 3.5%. 
A 2.3% rise for Apple helped offset such losses and was the strongest force lifting the S&P 500 to its latest record. After weakening in late July with other Big Tech stocks amid worries their prices had shot too high, Apple’s stock has been climbing back toward its all-time closing high of $234.82. It finished Monday at $233.00. 
All told, the S&P 500 rose 24.31 points to 5,762.48. The Dow added 17.15 to 42,330.15, and the Nasdaq gained 69.58 to 18,189.17.
In China, meanwhile, indexes soared 8.1% in Shanghai and 2.4% in Hong Kong following the latest announcements of stimulus for the world’s second-largest economy. It was the best day for Shanghai stocks in nearly 16 years.
China’s central bank announced moves on Sunday to ease mortgage rates for existing home loans by Oct. 31. That followed a flurry of announcements  last week from China’s central bank and government intended to prop up the Chinese economy, whose growth has been flagging in part because of the weight of a struggling real-estate sector.
Markets in mainland China will be closed Tuesday through Oct. 7 for a holiday marking 75 years of communist rule.
In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields rose after investors took comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a hint that coming cuts to interest rates may be more traditional sized. 
The Fed began its rate-cutting campaign with a larger-than-usual reduction of half a percentage point, and many traders had built expectations that the next meeting in November could yield a similar sized reduction. That was even though Fed policy makers had already indicated they were planning two more cuts this year of the traditional size of a quarter of a percentage point. 
But Powell said again on Monday that rate cuts are not something the Fed needs to work quickly on. After his comments, traders were betting on just a 35% probability the Fed will cut rates by another half a percentage point in November. That’s down from a 53% chance seen the day before, according to data from CME Group. 
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.78% from 3.75% late Friday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Fed will do with short-term rates, climbed to 3.63% from 3.56%.

Publication date:2024-09-23 07:00:00

TOKYO (AP) — Japan said its warplanes used flares to warn a Russian reconnaissance aircraft to leave northern Japanese airspace on Monday. 
Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara told reporters that the Russian Il-38 plane breached Japan’s airspace above Rebun Island, just off the coast of the country’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido, for up to a minute in three instances, during its five-hour flight in the area.
It came a day after a joint fleet of Chinese and Russian warships sailed around Japanese northern coasts. Kihara said the airspace violation could be related to a joint military exercise that Russia and China announced earlier this month.
Japan scrambled an undisclosed number of F-15 and F-35 fighter jets, which used flares for the first time after the Russian aircraft apparently ignored their warnings, Kihara said.
“The airspace violation was extremely regrettable,” Kihara said. He said Japan “strongly protested” to Russia through diplomatic channels and demanded preventive measures. 
“We will carry out our warning and surveillance operations as we pay close attention to their military activities,” he said. 
Kihara said the use of flares was a legitimate response to airspace violation and “we plan to use it without hesitation.”
Japanese defense officials are highly concerned about growing military cooperation between the China and Russia, and China’s increasingly assertive activity around Japanese waters and airspace. It led Tokyo to significantly reinforce defenses of southwestern Japan, including remote islands that are considered key to Japan’s defense strategy in the region.


Earlier in September, Russian military aircraft flew around southern Japanese airspace. A Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft briefly violated Japan’s southern airspace in late August.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — No. 9 hitter Brayan Rocchio drove in four runs and the Cleveland Guardians beat Kansas City 7-1 Tuesday night, extending the Royals’ losing streak to a season-high seven.
Kansas City was held to two runs or fewer for the fifth straight game and managed just four hits. The Royals’ losing streak is its longest since a 10-game skid from June 5-16 last year.
Since tying Cleveland for the AL Central lead on Aug. 27, the Royals (76-65) have dropped 5 1/2 games behind the Guardians (80-59), who have won five of six. Kansas City maintained a 4 1/2-game lead for the final AL wild card.
Royals manager Matt Quatraro missed his second game after the death of his mother Dorann Stagnitta. Bench coach Paul Hoover served as acting manager.
Cleveland first baseman Josh Naylor left for a pinch runner after singling in the eighth inning because of lower back tightness. 
Steven Kwan had a two-run single for the Guardians and Kyle Manzardo had three hits.
Tanner Bibee (11-6) allowed one run and two hits in six innings — just the 39th time a Cleveland starter pitched six or more innings. 
“I thought he was great, just attacking, throwing a lot of strikes,” Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said. “Especially after the third, he settled in and threw a ton of strikes, kept them off balance.” 
Kansas City’s Bobby Witt Jr. had his big league-best 57th multihit game of the season.


Brady Singer (9-10) allowed two runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings.
Rocchio’s sacrifice fly in the second and Andrés Giménez’s bloop RBI single in the fifth built a 2-0 lead.
Kansas City loaded the bases with no outs in the sixth, but Tommy Pham failed to tag up at third on Salvador Perez’s line drive to left. Paul DeJong followed with a sacrifice fly and Bibee struck out MJ Melendez.
“He can make pitches in big-time moments,” Vogt said. “Tanner is a big-time pitcher. He wants those moments, and for him to be able to slow down and execute in that situation was huge.”
Bibee is 7-3 with a 2.71 ERA in 14 road starts, and the Guardians are 20-7 in his outings this year.
“I was just trying to execute the next pitch,” Bibee said of the sixth inning. “When I get into a lot of trouble, I feel like it’s trying to do way too much. I think one goal for me today was just to execute one pitch at a time.”
Rocchio hit his seventh home run of the season in the bottom of the sixth, a two-run drive against Sam Long that was just inside the left-field foul pole. The 23-year-old rookie homered after failing on a pair of bunt attempts.
“When I missed the first two bunts, I’m trying to stay calm and be patient to move the runner to second base. But I put a good swing on it,” Roochio said. “Awesome, because I know if I don’t do anything, maybe he’s mad at me” in a reference to Vogt.
“It’s really easy when you don’t do your job or don’t get the job done to get down on yourself and just give away and at-bat, but he got pitch up and he crushed it,” Vogt said.
Rocchio added a bases-loaded walk in the eighth against James McArthur for a career-best four RBIs.
Hoover said the Royals are pressing.
“What you saw in the sixth is probably what we need to do hopefully from inning one, just stringing a couple at-bats together, passing the baton and the next guy up hopefully can do the job,” Hoover said. “We want to be successful, but sometimes we want it so bad that we try to do a little too much.”
Royals: 1B-3B Yuli Gurriel, acquired from Atlanta on Sunday, is listed as day to day with right hamstring tightness. He was replaced after doubling in the eighth inning Monday and did not play Tuesday.

ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s state school superintendent says he wants the state to spend more money to guarantee security officers and wearable panic alert buttons after a school shooting killed four at Apalachee High School northeast of Atlanta.
Richard Woods, a Republican elected statewide, also said Monday that he wants to expand a state-sponsored program to provide mental health care to students and to better share information about threats among police, schools and other agencies.
“It is crucial that we redouble our efforts to secure our schools and protect every student in our state,” Woods said in a statement.
Woods is the second statewide leader to make proposals following the the Sept. 4 shooting at the high school in Winder. His ideas on expanding mental health care and information sharing mirror those voiced last week by Republican state House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington.
Gov. Brian Kemp has said he would review any proposals but said the investigation is still turning up new information. A spokesperson for Republican Lt. Gov Burt Jones said he is preparing a response.
Democrats have been slamming Republicans, arguing that the shooting is an outgrowth of the GOP loosening Georgia’s gun laws. Woods didn’t propose any changes to gun laws.
Teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie, 53, and students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, died in the shooting. Nine others were injured — seven of them shot.


Investigators say the shooting was carried out by 14-year-old Colt Gray, who has been charged as an adult with four counts of murder. Authorities charged his 54-year-old father, Colin Gray, with second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and cruelty to children. Investigators allege Colin Gray gave his son access to a semiautomatic AR-15-style rifle when he knew the teen was a danger to himself and others.
Woods’ call for information sharing reflects the fact that Colt and his father were questioned in 2023 by a Jackson County sheriff’s deputy over an online post threatening a school shooting. Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum has said her office didn’t find enough evidence to bring charges. It’s unclear if Colt Gray’s earlier schools were notified about the threats.
The superintendent also said he wants to expand mental health care for students. The state’s voluntary Apex program steers students toward counseling. The program covered 540,000 of Georgia’s 1.75 million students in 2022-2023, about 31%.
The state budget that began July 1 includes more than $100 million in ongoing funding for school security, enough to provide $47,000 a year to each public school for safety. Kemp and others have said they want that money to pay for at least one security officer for each school, but local superintendents have said the cost for to pay for a school resource officer is significantly higher. Woods said he wants the state to spend more money specifically for school resource officers and alert systems, but didn’t specify how much.
Georgia Department of Education spokesperson Meghan Frick said Woods “hopes to engage in an open discussion with lawmakers and other partners to determine more specific details, including the specifics of APEX expansion and record-sharing.
Burns also said last week that he wants to examine ways to catch guns before they enter schools, increase penalties for threats against schools, and said House Republicans would again promote safe firearm storage using a tax credit.
State Democrats gained little traction on legislation that would have created a misdemeanor crime for negligently failing to secure firearms accessed by children. Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat, has promised to bring back that proposal.",False

CLAYMONT, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden told Indo-Pacific allies on Saturday that he believes China’s increasing military assertiveness is an effort to test the region at a turbulent moment for Beijing.
Biden’s comments were caught by a hot mic after he and fellow leaders of the so-called Quad delivered opening remarks before the press at a summit he’s hosting near his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. He said his administration sees Beijing’s actions as a “change in tactic, not a change in strategy.”
China is struggling to pull up its economy that was pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic and has seen an extended slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand.
“China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region, and it’s true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South China, South Asia and the Taiwan Straits,” Biden told Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. He added, “At least from our perspective, we believe (Chinese President) Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China’s diplomatic relationships, and he’s also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China’s interest.” 
Starting with a trade war that dates back to 2018, China and the United States have grown at odds over a range of issues, from global security, such as China’s claims over the South China Sea, to industrial policy on electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturing. 
The administration has repeatedly spoken out about concerns about Chinese aggression toward Taiwan and more recently on the frequent clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in disputed areas of the South China Sea. 


At the summit, the leaders agreed to expand the partnership among the Quad nations’ coast guards to improve interoperability and capabilities, with Indian, Japanese and Australian personnel sailing on U.S. ships in the region. But U.S. officials would not say if those transits would include the contested South China Sea.
China also has longtime territorial disputes involving other claimants including Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. U.S. officials worry about China’s long-stated goals of unifying Taiwan with China’s mainland and the possibility of war over Taiwan. The self-ruled island democracy is claimed by Beijing as part of its territory. 
The leaders in a joint declaration issued following their talks expressed “serious concern about the militarization ... and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea.” 
Biden last month dispatched his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Beijing for three days of talks with Chinese officials. Sullivan during that visit also met with Xi.
Both governments are eager to keep relations on an even keel ahead of a change in the U.S. presidency in January. And both sides have said they remain committed to managing the relationship, following up on a meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco last November.
The concerns about China were raised as Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India as he hosted what is likely the last gathering of the Indo-Pacific partnership that has grown in prominence under his White House tenure.
When Biden began his presidency he looked to elevate the Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend’s summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021.
“It will survive way beyond November,” Biden told the leaders.
The president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner.
“I don’t think the headmaster of this school thought I’d be presiding over a meeting like this,” Biden joked to fellow leaders.
Albanese, Modi and Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week.
“This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,” said Kishida, who like Biden, is set to soon leave office.
Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. 
White House officials said holding the talks at the president’s house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel.
Sullivan described the vibe of Biden’s one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as “two guys — one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.” He said Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers.
The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him “insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.”
Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks.
“There cannot be a better place than President Biden’s hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,” Modi said.
Biden and Modi discussed Modi’s recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments.
The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and concerns about China.
Biden during their face-to-face meeting commended Kishida for demonstrating “courage and conviction in strengthening ties” with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China, Russia’s war against Ukraine and emerging technology issues.
The U.S. and Japan are dealing with a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Biden, as well as presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel.
Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee’s formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the Nov. 5 election.
The summit declaration also condemned North Korea’s continued ballistic missile testing and expressed “deep concern about countries that are deepening military cooperation with North Korea.” The leaders were expected to discuss the issue in more depth over dinner.
The U.S. has publicized intelligence findings that show North Korea and Iran have provided Russia with ballistic missiles and other weaponry for its war in Ukraine and that Moscow is in turn tightening its relationship with Pyongyang and Tehran.
The leaders announced their four countries are committing $150 million for HPV vaccines, screening and therapeutics in the Indo-Pacific. Relatively few women in the region get screened for the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. 
U.S. Navy doctors and nurses will also launch a program to train their Pacific counterparts on conducting cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccinations.
The announcement is related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths. 
The Bidens’ son Beau died in 2015 at age 46 of brain cancer.

BEIRUT (AP) — Smoke was still rising from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday morning, visible to many of the families who had fled their homes there the night before to escape Israel’s massive bombardment.

It had been a harrowing night — getting out amid earthshaking explosions, looking in vain for space in one of the overflowing schools-turned-shelters. By the morning, hundreds of families were sleeping in public squares, on beaches or in cars around Beirut.

Lines of people trudged up to the mountains above the Lebanese capital, holding infants and a few belongings.

Overnight, Israel unleashed a series of strikes on various parts of Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut’s southern edge where tens of thousands of residents live. The biggest blasts to hit Beirut in nearly a year of conflict killed the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, Friday.

The assault was part of a rapid escalation of Israeli strikes the past week that has killed more than 700 people in Lebanon. Israel has vowed to cripple Hezbollah and put an end to 11 months of its fire onto Israeli territory in what Nasrallah described as a “support front” for his ally Hamas in Gaza.





The people escaping Friday night’s mayhem joined tens of thousands who have fled to Beirut and other areas of southern Lebanon the past week to escape Israel’s bombardment.

For many residents of Dahiyeh, the forced evacuation was disconcertingly familiar.

Some were Lebanese who had lived through the bruising monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, when Israel leveled large parts of the Beirut suburbs. Others were Syrians who had taken refuge from the long civil war in their own country.

Fatima Chahine, a Syrian refugee, slept on the Ramlet al-Bayda public beach in Beirut with her family and hundreds of strangers. The night before she, her husband and their two children had piled onto a motorcycle and raced out of Dahiyeh, with “bombing below us and strikes above us.”

“Thank God, no one was wounded,” she said.

The government has opened up schools in Beirut to take in the displaced. But Syrians have reported that some sites turn them away to reserve the few spaces for Lebanese. Chahine said her family came directly to the beach.

“We only want a place where our children won’t be afraid,” she said. “We fled from the war in Syria in 2011 because of the children and we came here, and now the same thing is happening again.”

Since Monday, some 22,331 Syrians in Lebanon have crossed back into Syria, along with 22,117 Lebanese, according to Lebanese authorities. 

Chahine said returning is not an option for her family; she is from an opposition area and so could face reprisals from the Syrian government.

At the beach, the displaced were spread out over the sidewalk or in cars parked by the curb. Others were camped out in beach pagodas or on blankets in the sand. 

“We spent more than three hours going in circles between schools and shelters and we didn’t find one with room,” said Talal Ahmad Jassaf, a Lebanese man who slept on the beach with his family. He said he is considering going to the relative safety of Syria. But he worries about airstrikes on the road between Beirut and Damascus.







The U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said this week’s escalation had more than doubled the number of people displaced by the conflict in Lebanon. There are now over 211,000 people displaced, including some of the humanitarian workers who should be responding to the crisis, it said. Around 85,000 of them are sleeping in shelters, it said.

“Humanitarian capacities to respond have been severely overstretched,” it added.

Displaced people sleeping outside in Beirut largely told The Associated Press that they had not received assistance from any humanitarian organization.

A stadium in the seaside neighborhood of Manara owned by the Nejmeh soccer club opened its doors to the displaced, who spent the night sleeping on bleachers.

Among them was Mariam Darwish, her husband and five children. She fled her home in Dahiyeh earlier in the week when the first Israeli strikes hit there.

Darwish said they had received water from the soccer club but that no organization had brought food, blankets or other supplies.

“People are helping each other out, family and friends are getting things for each other,” she said.

She and her husband had fled during the 2006 war, when their oldest son was a baby, and returned to their home when the war ended. They hope their house will still be standing to return to this time, she said.

“We’re worried about our children and the schools, that they’ll lose out on their future,” she said. “What can we do? We can only say thank God.”

She added, “May the resistance be victorious.” At the time of the interview, Hezbollah had not yet confirmed Nasrallah’s death.

Despite their battered-down circumstances, others also struck a defiant tone.

Jamal Hussein fled Dahiyeh at 3 a.m. with his extended family amid ongoing bombing and spent the night sleeping on the seaside promenade in Beirut’s upscale Ain Mreisseh district.

“Of course we aren’t afraid for ourselves, but we have children,” he said. “We are steadfast and ready to sacrifice more than this.”",False

Russia’s top diplomat warned Saturday against “trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power,” delivering a U.N. General Assembly speech packed with condemnations of what Russia sees as Western attempts at global domination and machinations in Ukraine -- and even inside the United Nations itself.
Three days after Russian President Vladimir Putin aired a shift in his country’s nuclear doctrine, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of using Ukraine — which Russia invaded in February 2022 — as a tool to try “to defeat” Moscow strategically, and “preparing Europe for it to also throw itself into this suicidal escapade.”
“I’m not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,” he said. 
Putin’s recent announcement — which appeared to lower significantly the threshold for the possible use of Russia’s nuclear arsenal — was seen as a message to the U.S. and other Western countries as Ukraine seeks their go-ahead to strike Russia with longer-range weapons. 
“Whether or not they will provide the permission for Ukraine for long-range weapons, then we will see what their understanding was of what they heard,” Lavrov said at a news conference after his speech Saturday.
The Biden administration this week announced an additional $2.7 billion in military aid for Ukraine, but it doesn’t include the type of long-range arms that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking, nor a green light to use such weapons to strike deep into Russia. 


In the wide-ranging news conference, Lavrov complained that the “arrogance and aggressiveness of Western politicians” toward Russia was hobbling global governance, from the U.N. Security Council to the newly adopted Pact for the Future, which Russia sought unsuccessfully to water down.
He was critical of the geopolitical and military expansion of NATO, saying, “It is now trying to take root in the south Caucusus, in central Asia, creating direct threats to the security of our country.”
NATO has partnerships with the three south Caucusus countries – Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan — and all central Asian countries except Afghanistan. But none is a NATO member. “And now the same is happening in the Asia-Pacific region, where NATO infrastructure is creeping in to contain or deter China and Russia,” he told the assembly.
Lavrov accused the United States of seeking “to preserve their hegemony and to govern everything.” He pointed to NATO’s deepening relations with four partners – New Zealand, Australia, South Korea and Japan — as well as the so-called Quad which groups the U.S., India, Australia and Japan.
On nuclear issues, when Russia suspended the New START nuclear treaty with the United States in February 2023, it said Moscow would abide by its limits – a maximum 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. Lavrov told reporters Russia will comply with the levels until the expiration of the treaty in 2026.
The specter of nuclear threats and confrontation has hung over the war in Ukraine since its start. Shortly before the invasion, Putin reminded the world that his country was “ one of the most powerful nuclear states,” and he put its nuclear forces on high alert shortly after. His nuclear rhetoric has ramped up and toned down at various points since.
On Wednesday, Putin said that if attacked by any country supported by a nuclear-armed nation, Russia will consider that a joint attack. He didn’t specify whether that would bring a nuclear response, but he stressed that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional assault that posed a “critical threat to our sovereignty.” 
The United States and the European Union called his statements “irresponsible.” There was no immediate response to Lavrov’s address Saturday from the U.S., which had a junior diplomat taking notes in its assembly seat as he spoke. 
More than 2½ years into the fighting, Russia is making slow but continuing gains in Ukraine’s east. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russian territory with missiles and drones and embarrassed Moscow with a surprise incursion by its troops last month that made significant gains in a border region.
Zelenskyy has pushed what he calls a peace formula to end the war. Provisions include expelling all Russian forces from Ukraine, ensuring accountability for war crimes, freeing prisoners of war and deportees, and more. 
Meanwhile, Brazil and China have been floating a peace plan that entails holding a peace conference with both Ukraine and Russia and not expanding the battlefield or otherwise escalating fighting. Chinese and Brazilian diplomats have been promoting the plan during the assembly and attracted a dozen other nations, mostly in Africa or Latin America, to join a group of “friends for peace” in Ukraine.
Lavrov said at his news conference that Russia was ready to provide assistance and advice to the group, adding that “it’s important for their proposals to be underpinned by the realities and not just be taken from some abstract conversations.”

AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Hank Brown passed for 235 yards and four touchdowns in his first career start and Jarquez Hunter rushed for 152 yards to lead Auburn to a 45-19 victory over New Mexico on Saturday night.
Brown, a redshirt freshman who originally committed to play for Tigers coach Hugh Freeze at Liberty, claimed the starting job after Payton Thorne was intercepted four times in a loss to California. It remains his job to lose.
Brown threw for three second-half touchdowns, and Freeze said he “had a solid, solid first game” as starter.
“I made the decision,” Freeze said, adding that he made the call Monday and told the team on Thursday. “I’ve stood with Payton and still believe that he’s a good football player.
“You never know if his number gets called again and he’s handled the disappointment very well.”
Auburn (2-1) still struggled to put away the Lobos (0-3) until the second half. New Mexico came in as 24-1/2-point underdogs, according to BetMGM.com, but trailed just 17-13 at the half.
Brown came into the game having completed 3 of 5 passes for 96 yards with a pair of touchdowns and no interceptions. He was 17-of-25 passing with no major mistakes and will remain the starter heading into Southeastern Conference play, Freeze said.
“It’s definitely surreal,” Brown said. “It’s encouraging. I think I’ve got a lot to build on from this week and from this game. I’m excited. I love when the competition level is raised, and I think that’s when I’m at my best when we’re playing the best.”


Hunter had a touchdown rushing and receiving.
New Mexico’s Devon Dampier passed for 291 yards with a touchdown on fourth-and-4 to Caleb Medford early in the fourth. He was intercepted twice. Ryan Davis had six catches for 100 yards.
New Mexico’s upset bid pretty much ended when Dampier was picked off by Antonio Kite on a fourth-and-5 pass from the Auburn 25 in the third quarter. 
“We were aggressive. We worked hard to get touchdowns rather than field goals but our numbers weren’t great,” Lobos coach Bronco Mendenhall said. “But we certainly were aggressive, and that was the intent.”
Brown’s success, including the Tigers’ 503 total yards, was put in perspective with the Lobos coming in ranked last among 133 FBS teams in total defense. They were allowing 597 yards per game.
New Mexico: Played a Power 4 conference team tight for a half for the second straight week after a 61-39 loss to No. 20 Arizona. Committed 16 penalties for 112 yards.
Auburn: Freeze said Brown earned another starting shot against Arkansas, avoiding big mistakes and throwing a perfect strike on a 50-yarder to KeAndre Lambert-Smith down the right sideline. The Tigers’ play still doesn’t inspire much confidence heading into Southeastern Conference games.
Auburn freshman receiver Cam Coleman watched the game in street clothes with a right shoulder injury. Coleman’s 115 receiving yards (on four catches) led the team through two games. Camden Brown took his place. Right tackle Izavion Miller (hip) also missed the game.

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Firefighters on Monday battled flames spreading through a national park in Brazil that is enveloping Brasilia in smoke. It’s the latest wildfire in the country, which is experiencing an historic drought.
More than 490 firefighters were trying to extinguish blazes that have already burned through 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres) of the conservation area of Brasilia National Park. There are four main fire fronts, all concentrated in the eastern region of the park, according to a statement from ICMBio, the government agency that manages the park.

The fire “spread very quickly because of wind speed, low humidity, and it is very hot,” João Paulo Morita, an ICMBio fire management coordinator, said in a video distributed by the agency.
The situation improved towards the end of the day, Morita said, adding that there were still fires in the woods near the streams. “The job tonight will be to fight these fires that are inside these forests,” he added. 
Three aircraft are using water to tackle the flames, and a helicopter is helping to monitor the burned areas, the ICMBio statement said.
Federal Police are investigating the case, as the fire was started by human activity, the statement said, adding that so far there have no reports of injured or rescued animals.
The head of the agency, Mauro Pires, told newspaper Folha de S.Paulo that the fire appears to have started near the edge of the presidency’s countryside residence.

Smoke from the fire smothered the capital, Brasilia, on Monday, and columns of black smoke were visible from several points in the city.
Brazil has been enveloped in smoke in recent weeks, as fires rage in the Amazon rainforest, the Cerrado savanna and the Pantanal wetlands. Those uncontrolled, human-made wildfires have ravaged protected areas and spread smoke over a vast expanse, causing air quality to plummet.
The country is also enduring its worst drought since nationwide measurements began more than seven decades ago, with 59% of the country affected — an area roughly half the size of the U.S. Major Amazon basin rivers are registering historic lows.
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said on Instagram that the Federal Police have opened 52 investigations “against those responsible for the crimes against our country,” adding that he would be meeting with Environment Minister Marina Silva to “discuss further actions to deal with this climate emergency.” On Sunday, he did a flyover of the park that’s spread across three of the Federal District’s administrative regions, including Brasilia, and one municipality in Goias state.
Supreme Court Justice Flávio Dino issued a ruling on Sunday authorizing the federal government to direct extra funds toward combating forest fires and hiring firefighters.
Scientists say that climate change — primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal — makes extreme weather more likely, favoring conditions for events such as wildfires and floods.

BALTIMORE (AP) — Kerry Carpenter homered twice, Parker Meadows made a home run-saving grab and the surging Detroit Tigers gained ground in the American League wild card race with a 4-3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday.
Carpenter’s third multi-home run game of the season ensured the Tigers their first winning season since 2016 as Detroit (82-74) matched Kansas City (82-74) and moved a half-game in front of Minnesota (81-74) for the final AL wild card spot. 
“We still have a long way to go, so we’re going to stay grounded,” said Tigers manager A.J. Hinch. “But both things can happen — we can be proud of what we’re doing and we can stay grounded and look forward to the next series.”
The Twins, who won the season series 7-6 with the Tigers, have the second game of their doubleheader in Boston later Sunday. The Twins would finish ahead of the Tigers if they finish with the same record.
The Tigers have won 11 of their last 14.
Baltimore (86-70) lost its fifth consecutive series and fell 5 1/2 games behind New York (91-64) in the AL East race with six to play but is still four games ahead of Kansas City and Detroit for the top wild card spot.
“We had a great chance to win last night, didn’t get it done,” said Orioles manager Brandon Hyde. “We had a chance today also. I thought we just had some unfortunate breaks today.”
Spencer Torkelson homered off Orioles right-hander Albert Suarez (8-7) and Trey Sweeney contributed an RBI double as the Tigers took a 2-0 lead.


Carpenter hit the first of his two homers in the third to make it 3-0.
Cedric Mullins connected with a two-run shot for Baltimore. Jordan Westburg added an RBI double in his first game since July 31 (right wrist fracture) to complete a three-run fifth and tie things up at 3-3.
The damage would’ve been greater without Meadows’ leaping grab over the wall in right-center to deny Colton Cowser a two-run homer off Sean Guenther (2-0) and end the inning.
“I was getting ready to jump at the wall,” said Carpenter, who was in right field with Meadows in center. “And then I saw him. He was locked on that thing.” 
Carpenter led off the sixth with his second deep shot and 17th of the season, which cleared the front of the grounds crew shed in right by a few feet.
“It’s huge,” Carpenter said. “They could’ve taken a two-run lead and then two minutes later I hit the homer and we’re up by one. So it changes the entire game.”
From there, Brenan Hanifee and Will Vest bridged the gap to Jason Foley, who worked a perfect ninth for his 26th save.
Tigers: INF Colt Keith (right shoulder) made his first defensive start since Tuesday, playing second base. ... Hanifee took Ramon Urías’ sixth-inning liner off the left thigh but remained in the game.
Orioles: Reinstated Westburg and Urías (right ankle sprain) from the 10-day injured list and optioned OF Daniel Johnson and INF Livan Soto to Triple-A Norfolk.
Tigers: Will return to using a conventional starter to begin a home series against Tampa Bay on Tuesday when AL Cy Young contender Tarik Skubal (17-4, 2.48 ERA) makes his 31st start.
Orioles: Dean Kremer (7-10, 4.19) will try to complete six-plus innings for a fourth consecutive start to open Tuesday’s series at the New York Yankees.

HONOLULU (AP) — About 2,000 workers went on strike Tuesday at Hawaii’s largest resort, joining thousands of others striking at hotels in other U.S. cities. 
Unionized workers at Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort — the largest Hilton in the world — began an open-ended strike at 5 a.m. They are calling for conditions including higher wages, more manageable workloads and a reversal of cuts implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic such as limited daily room cleaning. 
Hilton representatives didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the strike.
Greg and Kerrie Sellers woke up Tuesday to drum beats, whistles and chants that they could hear coming from below their balcony at the resort. 
“We heard the commotion from when we first woke up this morning,” Greg Sellers recalled as they sat on a bench overlooking a lagoon outside the resort. “I don’t know that it’s going to have a great impact on our time here. I guess we’re sympathetic to the cause because ... the working rights over in Australia are much, much better than what they seem to be ... over here.”
Beachgoers sunbathing or sitting under umbrellas at the stretch of Waikiki beach near the resort could hear the strikers in the distance as hotel guests enjoyed the pool, shops and restaurants throughout the sprawling resort. 
Outside on the street, workers marched and chanted bearing signs with slogans such as “One Job Should Be Enough,” which reflects how many Hawaii residents work multiple jobs to afford living in a state with an extremely high cost of living. 


With the start of Tuesday’s strike, more than 4,000 hotel workers are now on strike at Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott hotels in Honolulu, San Diego and San Francisco, according to the UNITE HERE union. They will strike until they win new contracts, the union said, warning that more strikes could begin soon.
More than 10,000 hotels workers across the U.S. went on strike on Labor Day weekend, with most ending after two or three days. 
Aileen Bautista said she has three jobs, including as a housekeeper at Hilton Hawaiian Village, in order to makes ends meet as a single mom. 
“I am on strike again, and this time I am ready to stay on strike for as long as it takes to win,” she said in a statement. 
Her coworker, Estella Fontanilla, paused from using a megaphone to lead marching workers in chants to explain that preserving daily housekeeping is crucial because it is much harder to clean rooms that haven’t been cleaned for days. She said she wants guests to keep asking for daily cleaning. 
It was unclear how the strike would impact hotel services. The union warned that hotels where workers are striking may suspend services while trying to operate with skeleton staffing, and picket lines will run outside hotels for up to 24 hours a day.
“During earlier strikes, guests experienced disruptions including unavailable daily housekeeping, towels and linens piled up in hallways, piles of trash visible outside, closed bars and restaurants, and reduced pool hours,” the union said in a statement.
The hotel strike comes as more than 600 nurses are locked out of the Kapi‘olani Medical Center for Women & Children after going on a one-day strike earlier this month. On Monday, 10 people were arrested for blocking busloads of temporary nurses from entering the Honolulu hospital where nurses are calling for safer patient-nurse ratios.
On Tuesday, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green and Attorney General Anne Lopez urged hospital and union leaders to seek federal mediation to help reach an agreement.",False

NEW YORK (AP) — BMW is lowering sales and earnings targets for the 2024 fiscal year, in a move the luxury German car maker said was partially triggered by hefty expenses of addressing a braking system recall that impacts more than 1.5 million vehicles worldwide.
Munich-based BMW Group said Tuesday that actions related to addressing a faulty integrated braking system, made by a supplier for the company, would reach “a high three-digit million (euro) amount” for the third quarter. Halted deliveries for impacted vehicles not already in customer hands are also expected to negatively impact sales.
A spokesperson for BMW Group, which also owns Rolls-Royce and Mini brands, confirmed to The Associated Press via email that the company first identified the issue during an internal quality check. That prompted a safety recall in February, but since then additional cases have been identified “beyond the scope of the original recall.” 
Now, BMW expects that some 1.53 million vehicles across five countries are affected — including about 370,000 in China, 270,000 in the U.S., 150,000 in Germany, 70,000 in Korea and 60,000 in France.
The affected vehicles were produced between June 2022 and August 2024, per BMW, and several models are covered. That includes select BMW X models (excluding X3 and X4), the 5 and 7 Series, Rolls-Royce Spectre, MINI Cooper and Countryman.
Of the 1.53 million affected cars, 1.2 million are already in customer hands — while about 320,000 remain with BMW or in dealer stock. One-third of those vehicles are impacted by individual market delivery stops, according to the company.


BMW’s spokesperson says that the company “has developed a diagnostic software to detect the brake fault before it occurs.” If a potential brake fault is detected, that should alert the driver with a warning to visit a dealership as soon as possible to get a system replacement free of charge, the spokesperson added. If a malfunction occurs, which BMW says is “very unlikely,” the system should also revert to “safe mode” — which makes sure that brakes work and meet legal standards, but requires drivers to apply more force when using them.
German auto supplier Continental AG confirmed Tuesday that it makes this integrated brake system for BMW, and that the faulty component can cause the case to rely on its back up level. In a statement, Continental also pointed to diagnostic software available to detect this potential issue “well before it occurs.”
Continental reiterated that the brake system can be replaced if such impairment is detected — but added that it expects “only a small proportion” of the brake systems it delivered to actually need a replacement. The company said it had built accruals in a “mid-double digit million euro area” to cover warranty costs.
Beyond costs tied to this braking system recall, BMW’s financial outlook update on Tuesday also pointed to “ongoing muted demand” in China specifically — which the company said is impacting sales volumes as consumer sentiment remains weak, despite stimulus measures from the government.
Citing both recall costs and dwindling demand in China, BMW is cutting its automotive segment’s 2024 earnings before interest and taxes margin, an important profitability metric, to 6% to 7% — down from a previous range of 8% to 10%. And the company now expects its annual return on capital employed to be between 11% and 13%, down from 15% to 20%.
BMW also now anticipates a slight decrease in worldwide deliveries for 2024, compared to a slight increase that was previously predicted.
Shares for BMW fell more than 11% by of Tuesday afternoon, while Continental was down over 10%.",False

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Lebanon’s Hezbollah launched over 100 rockets into northern Israel early Sunday in response to ramped-up Israeli attacks that killed dozens of people in Beirut, including a veteran leader of the militant group.
During the funeral Sunday of that Hezbollah commander, Ibrahim Akil, Hezbollah’s deputy leader Naim Kassem declared that the group is now in an “open-ended battle of reckoning” with Israel, and he vowed to prolong the misery of those displaced from the country’s north.
The Hezbollah rocket barrage overnight sent thousands of people scrambling into shelters. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired “toward civilian areas,” pointing to a possible escalation. Hezbollah says its attacks have been aimed at military targets.
The barrage came after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Friday killed at least 45 people, including one of Hezbollah’s top leaders as well as women and children. The militant group was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explode just days earlier.
Here’s the latest:
MUWASI, Gaza Strip — As the first rain of the cool season starts to fall in the Gaza Strip, displaced Palestinians living in the sprawling Muwasi tent camp are struggling to cope with flooding that is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.
Some children are entertained by the novelty of walking barefoot in the ankle-deep water, but their parents are less amused. The adults try to save what they can from their family’s tents. One mother tries to dry her temporary home with a mop.


“We woke up in the morning to find the tents with rainwater pouring on us, and water from the streets entering on us,” said Rana Goza’t, a displaced person from Gaza City. “This is the beginning of winter. What will happen in the coming days?”
Suhail Al-Barawi, a displaced person from Beit Lahiya, was helping to build sand barriers to prevent more flooding in the camp.
“People wish for rain,” he said, “and we say, ‘Oh God, do not give us rain.’”
The nearly yearlong war between Israel and Hamas has displaced 90% of Palestinians in Gaza, according to the United Nations.
Israel’s defense minister says recent attacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon are a step toward facilitating the return of displaced Israelis to their homes in the north of the country.
Speaking Sunday evening after visiting the military’s Northern Command headquarters, Yoav Gallant described the recent air strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut as “significant, important and powerful.”
He says Israel will take all necessary measures to ensure “the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes.”
Israeli attacks since Friday have killed dozens in Lebanon, including a veteran Hezbollah commander. Hezbollah responded with more than 100 missile attacks in northern Israel early Sunday, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis into air raid shelters.
Gallant says: “The past week has been the most difficult in the history of Hezbollah’s existence —especially over the past day.”
DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Two Israeli strikes in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah have killed at least seven people, according to hospital officials.
The first strike hit an apartment building early Sunday killing four people, including two women, followed by a second one in the afternoon that killed at least three more people.
The bodies were rushed to the Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the city.
Not long after funeral prayers were held for them outside the hospital, three more bloodied bodies arrived at the hospital, including one that appeared to be missing a leg.
JERUSALEM — Israel’s military chief says the army is prepared to step up pressure on Hezbollah in the coming days.
Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi told reporters Sunday that Israel is committed to returning tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by nearly a year of fighting to their homes.
He said Israel has inflicted heavy damage against Hezbollah in recent weeks, and if the Lebanese militant group hasn’t learned its lesson, “it will receive another blow and another blow.”
Halevi says the army is on a high level of readiness and prepared to take additional steps in the coming days. “We have many capabilities that we have not yet activated,” he said.
MAYS AL-JABAL, Lebanon — A funeral has taken place in the southern Lebanese border town of Mays al-Jabal for seven people killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut, among them three women and two girls.
Men in black wearing yellow scarves with the Hezbollah logo stood quietly Sunday, as women wept and threw rice and rose petals over the coffins — five draped in Lebanese flags, and two in flags of Hezbollah’s Imam Mahdi Scouts. 
Mourners waved flags representing Hezbollah and the Amal Movement, a Lebanese Shia political party, and expressed their rage over Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.
“Tell our brothers in this country, you must realize that this enemy and America and all these countries behind it are traitors to us, and have betrayed us and sold us out and do not believe our words,” said Sheikh Bassam Karout, a local imam who officiated the funeral.
The Israeli strike Friday in a crowded suburb south of the Lebanese capital killed several members of the militant Hezbollah group, including the head of its elite Radwan Force Ibrahim Akil. Civilians were among the dozens killed.
Batoul Nasrallah, mourning the loss of several relatives at the funeral, called the Israelis “cowards.”
“(Israel) relies on the laws of the jungle instead of international conventions, especially with protecting civilians,” Melhem Khalaf, a Christian Lebanese parliamentarian from Beirut, told The Associated Press.
LONDON — The U.K.’s top diplomat is calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Sunday that the fighting is in nobody’s interest.
“In recent days, we have seen worrying escalation between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah,” Lammy said. “Our message to all parties is clear: We need an immediate ceasefire from both sides so that we can get to a political settlement.”
He also advised British nationals to “leave now” for their safety, repeating a message the Foreign Office has delivered several times recently.
WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is pushing for a diplomatic solution to end the attacks between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which have killed dozens of people in Beirut and pushed hundreds of thousands into underground shelters in Israel’s north.
Speaking Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. has been “involved in extensive and quite assertive diplomacy” in the region.
He says: “We still believe that there can be time and space for a diplomatic solution here”
According to a statement from the Pentagon, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant on Saturday about the Hezbollah rocket attacks and stressed the need for a diplomatic solution.
As concerns bringing an end to the conflict in Gaza, Kirby says they have not achieved “any progress here in the last week to two weeks. Not for lack of trying.” 
He says the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, doesn’t appear to be “negotiating in good faith,” citing the recent killing of six Israeli hostages in tunnels under Gaza. “But it doesn’t mean that we’re not trying.”
MUWASI, Gaza Strip — Palestinians in the Gaza Strip fear the war and worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory might be forgotten as tensions boil between Hezbollah and Israel.
The militant group launched more than 100 rockets into northern Israel early Sunday in response to an Israeli attack last week that killed dozens in Beirut, including a top Hezbollah commander.
“All focus of the news and media is on Lebanon. Gaza is forgotten,” Nezar Zaqout, who is living in a tent camp in Muwasi in southern Gaza, told The Associated Press. “Every day we heard that there was hope for negotiations, or new news that they were trying to solve the issue of the displaced … but we have become completely forgotten.”
In the sprawl of camps along Gaza’s coast that Israel has designated a humanitarian zone and where Zaqout and other displaced Palestinians are sheltering, children walk on dirt roads muddied by overnight rainstorms to wait in line for bread.
Saadi Abu Mustafa says he was hopeful for a ceasefire deal through Qatari, Egyptian, and American mediation, but he fears that the escalation in fighting and the focus on Lebanon will “affect us negatively.” Hezbollah has said it is confronting Israel in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza.
He says: “They leave Gaza without negotiations, without a prisoner, and without a ceasefire.”
BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s deputy leader says his group is now in an open-ended battle of reckoning with Israel, and he is threatening to displace more people in the country’s north.
Speaking Sunday during the funeral of top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Akil, Naim Kassem warned: “We admit that we are pained. We are humans. But as we are pained, you will also be pained.” 
His comments follow days of surprise Israeli attacks that have wounded thousands of people in Lebanon and killed members of Hezbollah, and hours after the militant group responded by launching rockets deep into northern Israel, including near the city of Haifa. 
He vows the ongoing conflict will destroy Israel’s economy and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “will not achieve your goals.” Hezbollah has said it is confronting Israel in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza.
Kassem says Hezbollah, which has lost several senior military leaders in recent months, has “returned stronger, and the frontline will witness this.”
He has said Hezbollah will stop attacking northern Israel only if the country can reach a ceasefire in Gaza with Hamas, and that a military solution will not allow the tens of thousands of people displaced from northern Israel to return.
BEIRUT — Hundreds of people gathered in southern Beirut Sunday for the funeral of top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Akil, killed in an Israeli airstrike on Friday alongside other members of the powerful militant group.
Akil’s coffin was draped in a yellow Hezbollah flag with his portrait.
Senior Hezbollah members attended the funeral, including deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem and senior parliamentarian Mohammad Raad.
Killed Hezbollah militant Mahmoud Hamad was also honored at the funeral. 
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah says the war with Israel has entered a “new phase”, saying the group “is ready for any scenario, war, or confrontation.”
Attending the funeral of a member of the Lebanese militant group who was killed among dozens of others in an Israeli strike on a Beirut neighborhood Friday, Fadlallah said “the southern front” has played a crucial role in pressuring Israel “to stop its war on Gaza.”
He also said that Israel won’t be able to achieve its “main goal ... to return settlers in the north,” as he praised the abilities of Hezbollah.
“We have a strong and capable resistance that possesses the capabilities, competencies, and numerous fighters and equipment that enable it to absorb any loss or blow, and to adapt to any new situation,” he said.
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel has dealt Hezbollah “blows that it did not imagine” after days of intense strikes on Lebanon.
In a video statement released by his office, Netanyahu said that if the militant group “did not get the message, I promise you, it will get the message.”
Netanyahu reiterated that Israel was determined to return its displaced citizens in the north, adding: “No country can tolerate fire on its residents, fire on its cities. And the state of Israel will not tolerate it either. We will do everything necessary to restore security.”",False

WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) — Donald Trump returned to North Carolina on Saturday, stumping in the southern battleground state with direct appeals to women, claiming he would be a better champion for them than Vice President Kamala Harris, who is vying to become the first female president. 
Trump campaigned in Wilmington, along the state’s southern coast, without Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the GOP gubernatorial nominee and one of the former president’s top surrogates in the state, following a CNN report about his alleged posts on a pornography website’s message board. He did not mention Robinson during a speech that lasted just over an hour.

Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn’t be forced out of the race by “salacious tabloid lies.” Trump’s campaign has appeared to distance itself from Robinson in the wake of the CNN reporting, which the AP has not independently verified, saying in a statement that Trump “is focused on winning the White House and saving this country” and calling North Carolina “a vital part of that plan,” without mentioning Robinson.
Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump’s ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together, as well as a new ad from Harris’ campaign highlighting the Republican candidates’ ties as well as Robinson’s support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. According to Harris’ campaign, it’s their first ad effort related to tying Trump to a down-ballot race.
Both abortion rights and Robinson are electoral liabilities for Trump in a state he previously won twice. Already before CNN’s report, Robinson was trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the state’s attorney general. Polls show Trump and Harris locked in a close race here and nationally.


In his first outdoor rally since the second apparent attempt to assassinate him, Trump argued women would be safer and more prosperous with him as president and would “no longer be thinking about abortion.”
“I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure,” Trump said. “Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and their lives will be great again. So women, we love you. We’re going to take care of you.”
The former president said women won’t have to think about abortion because decisions about regulating it are now left to the states. Many Republican-led states have taken steps to restrict or eliminate abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Trump nominated three of the six justices who voted to overturn Roe.
North Carolina banned most abortions after 12 weeks last year, with Republicans in the state legislature overriding Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto.
Voters overwhelmingly say they trust Harris to do a better job handling abortion policy, with 55% favoring her while 27% favored Trump in a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 
Harris and Democrats running down ballot have highlighted stories of women who faced severe medical complications or death because they didn’t get proper medical care from doctors worried about the impact of abortion laws. Harris on Friday blasted Trump as a threat to women’s freedoms and their lives, warning in a speech in Georgia that Republicans would continue to target access to abortion if he returns to the White House. 
“Trump is scared out of his mind that women will vote like our freedoms and our lives are on the line this November – and he should be, because that’s exactly what we will do,” Harris campaign Sarafina Chitika said in a statement after Trump’s rally. 
What to know about the 2024 Election
Trump also showed a gentler side, inviting two of his young grandchildren on stage. The former president lifted Carolina to the microphone, where she said “Make America great again” to cheers, followed by her older brother, Luke Trump, who said, “Vote for Grandpa.” They’re the children of Eric Trump, the former president’s second son, and his wife, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who is now serving as co-chair of the Republican National Committee. 
Bulletproof glass surrounded Trump as he spoke, a new precaution for outdoor venues the Secret Service implemented after a bullet grazed Trump’s ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. 
A Republican has carried North Carolina in every general election since 1976 save one, when Barack Obama won the state in 2008. Trump won there in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state that Trump won. That’s part of why Democrats see the state as winnable this fall.
With neither Senate seat up for grabs, the gubernatorial contest has been North Carolina’s marquee down-ballot race this year. Robinson has become a natural top surrogate for Trump in the state and a frequent presence at campaign events there, appearing with the nominee as recently as an event last month in Asheboro. Trump has long praised Robinson, who is Black, referring to him as “Martin Luther King on steroids.”
Endorsing Robinson ahead of the GOP gubernatorial primary, Trump continued: “I think you’re better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two.”
Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion “weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down” and comparing abortion to slavery.
Charlie Kimball, a 46-year-old former construction worker from Burgaw, who said he is currently on disability, dismissed the new allegations against Robinson as “fake news.”
“That’s his personal life. Who cares?” Kimball said. “It’s all hearsay … It’s not true. It’s all speculation. Where’s the proof?”
While more visits have been made by presidential contenders to the Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, both Harris and Trump have made multiple trips to North Carolina, highlighting the state’s importance. Following Biden’s departure from the race in July, Trump held his first large-scale rally there, turning his full focus toward Harris.
Wilmington is home to New Hanover County, which Biden won in 2020. But his margin over Trump in the county was among his slimmest in the state.
Julia Novotny, 55, of Wilmington, said she’s come around to supporting Trump after initial reservations because of allegations that he’s been sexually abusive to women, which he denies. 
“He’s classy, he’s a gentleman, he looks good in a suit and he has strong values,” Novotny said. “Everybody makes mistakes, and whether he did or didn’t, I don’t know, but you know what? Leave him alone. He’s a good man. He wants to change this country. Our country is in the dirt, and the only man who pulls us out is Donald Trump.”

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Michigan welcomed Southern California to the Big Ten with a heavy dose of smashmouth football.
Kalel Mullings surged 2 yards for a touchdown on fourth-and-goal with 37 seconds left, lifting the 18th-ranked Wolverines to a 27-24 win over the 11th-ranked Trojans in their conference debut.
Michigan (3-1, 1-0) overcame losing a 14-0 lead in the first half and coughing up two fumbles in the second half to extend its Big Ten winning streak to a school-record 26 games.
The Wolverines won with a 10-play, 89-yard TD drive as Mullings did most of the work.
The former linebacker converted a third down from the Michigan 20 with a 63-yard run and capped the possession with his second touchdown behind a fullback in a jumbo package that left little doubt where the ball was going.
“It’s not five guys, it’s seven with the tight ends out there,” Mullings said.
Michigan and USC had played 10 times previously, eight in the Rose Bowl and not in the regular season since 1958.
The Trojans (2-1, 0-1) went ahead 24-20 midway through the fourth when Miller Moss threw his third touchdown pass, a 24-yarder to Ja’Kobi Lane.
USC’s last chance ended with a fourth-down throw that came up of the stick near midfield.
“I think it was just a classic, back-and-forth fight,” Trojans coach Lincoln Riley said.
Mullings had a career-high 159 yards rushing, including a 53-yard scoring run to put the Wolverines ahead early, and Donovan Edwards had a 41-yard run to give them a two-touchdown lead.


Moss was 28 of 51 for 283 yards with a season-high three touchdowns and an interception that was returned for Michigan’s only other second-half score.
“I feel like I cost our team in a big way,” he said.
USC’s Woody Marks ran for 100 yards on 13 carries, and ripped the football out of Kenneth Grant’s hand after the big defensive tackle had recovered a fumble for Michigan.
Moss bounced back from throwing a pick-6 to Will Johnson that gave the defending national champions a double-digit lead in third quarter with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Jay Fair later in the period. His third touchdown pass to Lane with 7:01 left in the fourth came after Marks’ steal deep in Michigan territory.
Michigan needed a touchdown, trailing by four, in the final minute because USC defensive tackle Gavin Meyer blocked the extra point after Johnson’s interception return for a touchdown.
It also needed the clutch score because Edwards fumbled to set up a Trojans touchdown — and Michigan didn’t have a passing threat.
“Teams are going to stack the box and stop the run, and we still have to run the ball,” Mullings said.
Alex Orji made his first start at quarterback and was 7 of 12 for 32 yards and ran 13 times for 43 yards.
“If we threw for a million yards today and we lost, I’d be sitting here crying,” Orji said.
USC’s revamped defense under new coordinator D’Anton Lynn was in control on most plays, but gave up three long runs and failed to make a stop on the goal-line stand.
“We came up one play short,” Riley said.
Moore earned his first signature win as Jim Harbaugh’s successor, making enough moves that panned out in what was potentially a pivotal game in his first season.
“Our players never flinched and that’s what you’re really proud of,” he said.
USC receiver Makai Lemon left in the first quarter after taking a hit while covering a punt. Trojans tight end Lake McRee was hit hard on his left knee, taking another target from Moss. Riley did not have an update on either player’s condition after the game.
Johnson left the field in the second half with an apparent injury.
“He could’ve came back in,” Moore said.
Michigan preseason All-America tight end Colston Loveland was held out of the game after being injured last week.
Michigan may move up for the first time this season in the AP Top 25 and will extend a streak to 51 straight weeks of being ranked since early in the 2021 season. USC might slip a little in the poll.
USC hosts Wisconsin on Saturday.
Michigan hosts Minnesota on Saturday.

BERLIN (AP) — Egypt forward Omar Marmoush starred again to lead Eintracht Frankfurt to a 4-2 win at promoted Holstein Kiel for its fourth straight Bundesliga win on Sunday.
Marmoush scored two goals and set up the other two to help Frankfurt continue its winning run since starting the league with a 2-0 loss at Borussia Dortmund. He has scored in every win – Marmoush had never scored in four straight league games before.
“It’s a lot of fun,” the 25-year-old forward said. “I’m happy to play for this team and to help with goals and assists. We’re happy with the three points. That’s what counts, and not who scores.” 
Marmoush opened the scoring in the 25th minute and set up Igor Matanović’s first league goal after the break to cancel Shuto Machino’s penalty equalizer for Kiel.
Machino scored again in the 50th, but Marmoush replied again in the 65th, nine minutes before he set up Brazilian defender Tuta to seal the win.
The win means Frankfurt is just a point behind league leader Bayern Munich after five rounds. Bayern dropped its first points Saturday in a 1-1 draw with defending champion Bayer Leverkusen.
Jens Stage scored a hat trick and Werder Bremen recovered from conceding three early goals to beat Hoffenheim 4-3 in the late game.
The home team raced into a 12-minute three-goal lead after a brace from Marius Bülter and another goal from Adam Hložek, but the game turned following Stanley Nsoki’s sending off in the 18th for a foul on Felix Agu when the Bremen player was through on goal.


Julian Malatini pulled one back three minutes later, Stage scored six minutes after that, then equalized in the 39th.
Stage completed his hat trick after the break and Bremen might have had more – Derrick Köhn had another goal ruled out for offside.

PARIS (AP) — Bradley Barcola scored one goal in each half and Lee Kang-in added a third as Paris Saint-Germain beat Rennes 3-1 on Friday to extend its unbeaten run in the French league.
Barcola took a pass from Ousmane Dembélé after half an hour and steered a right-foot shot inside the far post. Lee got his third goal of the season to double the home side’s advantage 12 minutes into the second half and Barcola added his second with a simple tap in after 68 minutes. Arnaud Kalimuendo scored a consolation goal for Rennes from the penalty spot.
Rennes had a second goal chalked off by VAR with two minutes to end any hopes of a comeback.
Barcola fifth and sixth goals of the season take him to the top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts, one clear of Marseille’s Mason Greenwood.
PSG has 16 points from its first six games. Marseille is also unbeaten and has 13 points from five games. The south coast club plays at Strasbourg on Sunday.
Rennes is in eighth place with seven points from six games.
Auxerre beat Brest 3-0 on Friday to grab its second league win of the season and put the brakes on the visitor’s recent run of form.
Brest was coming off two consecutive victories, including a 2-1 win over Sturm Graz in its first ever Champions League match.
But under the pouring rain in central France, Auxerre finally showed some of the form that won it promotion last year and staved off a fifth straight defeat in Ligue 1.


Elisha Owusu put the home side ahead with a left-foot shot after 26 minutes and captain Jubal doubled the lead from the penalty spot 11 minutes later. Hamed Junior Traorè, on loan from Bournemouth, then got his second goal in two games 14 minutes into the second half.
The result leaves both teams with six points from six matches.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, a European Union naval mission said Saturday.
The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting three ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion.
The mission has “been actively involved in this complex endeavor, by creating a secure environment, which is necessary for the tugboats to conduct the towing operation,” the EU said.
A phone number for the mission rang unanswered Saturday. However, satellite images taken Saturday morning by Planet Labs PBC and later analyzed by The Associated Press showed what appeared to be the three salvage vessels close to the Sounion. A warship could be seen nearby.
The Greek state news agency ANA-MPA later reported the Aigaion Pelagos, a Greek-flagged tugboat, was involved in the effort. It said “three frigates, helicopters and a special forces unit” backed the salvagers.
“Despite challenging conditions, with temperatures reaching up to 400 degrees Celsius (752 degrees Fahrenheit) due to the fire, the specialized salvage team successfully secured the tanker to the Aigaion Pelagos,” the report said. 
The Sounion came under attack from the Houthis beginning Aug. 21. The vessel had been staffed by a crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, who were taken by a French destroyer to nearby Djibouti.


The Houthis later planted explosives aboard the ship and detonated them. That’s led to fears the ship’s 1 million barrels of crude oil could spill into the Red Sea.
The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. One of the sunken vessels, the Tutor, went down after the Houthis planted explosives aboard it and after its crew abandoned it due to an earlier attack, the rebel group later acknowledged.
Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets.
The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",False

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shohei Ohtani hit his 46th home run of the season to tie his career high, Jack Flaherty pitched another gem and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Cleveland Guardians 4-0 on Sunday in record-tying heat.
With the first-pitch temperature of 103 degrees matching the hottest in Dodger Stadium history, Ohtani hit a 450-foot solo shot down the right-field line off Tanner Bibee in the fifth inning that was reviewed to see if it was fair. 
Ohtani also hit 46 home runs in 2021 for the Los Angeles Angels in his unanimous AL MVP season. The Japanese star has 46 stolen bases in a bid to become the first major league player with a 50-50 season. 
“I’m trying to be less cognizant of it and moreso just focusing on having good feel at the plate and whenever possible during the game, whether that be stealing bases or moving to the next base, that’s what I’m trying to do,” Ohtani said through an interpreter.
Flaherty (12-6) went 7 1/3 innings, striking out six and allowing four hits. The Southern California native is 5-1 since coming over in a trade with Detroit. He said he was under the weather last week, too.
“It was fun when you get different elements like that, either really cold or really hot,” Flaherty said. “It was just another challenge. It was fun. You need a little preparation before that. Make sure everything is moving and hydrated. Pretty sure everyone else was hotter than I was out there.”


Max Muncy homered for the Dodgers in the eighth, his 12th of an injury-shortened season.
 As far as the scorching temperature, it also was 103 for first pitch for Game 1 of the 2017 World Series against Houston. The Dodgers made a voucher available to all fans for a free bottle of water.
Ohtani was 2 for 4. He was picked off first base in the third inning.
Mookie Betts hit a standup triple in the fourth inning. Tyler Freeman tried to make a leaping catch into the wall, then the ball ricocheted off the wall. Will Smith drove him in with a single for a 1-0 lead.
Bibee (11-7), also from Southern California, allowed two earned runs in five innings. He threw 28 pitches in the fourth inning.
“Feel like I threw really well, to be honest, but the score doesn’t really reciprocate that,” Bibee said.
Muncy hit a homer but his highlight was when he jumped high to snag a line drive off the bat of Josh Naylor in the fourth inning. Muncy said his teammates had some fun with him getting up to grab that ball. So did manager Dave Roberts. “Muncy and I have an inside joke because he swears he can dunk a basketball,” Roberts said. “Obviously, he’s a bigger guy but I told him I believe he can dunk a basketball now. He got up there pretty good. He doesn’t have that in his game much anymore but fortunately he picked the right spot.” 
Dodgers P Gavin Stone (right shoulder inflammation) will not throw for 10 days and then build back up and see where he’s at, according to Dave Roberts. His status for the postseason is certainly in question with 19 games remaining. 
Cleveland RHP (4-7, 4.19 ERA) Ben Lively was set to start Monday night against the White Sox in Chicago. Los Angeles RHP Walker Buehler (1-4, 5.67 ERA) was scheduled to start for Los Angeles at home Monday night against the Cubs.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. historian and author Timothy Snyder on Saturday led a charity run in Kyiv to raise awareness of the conditions under which Ukrainian prisoners of war are held in Russia as the conflict approaches a third winter.
The race came following a recent escalation in Russian missile and drone attacks, largely aimed at Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure.
People clapped and cheered after Snyder, a 55-year-old Yale University professor who has written extensively on eastern Europe and the global resurgence of authoritarian regimes and is much admired in Ukarine, addressed the nearly thousand runners. He then joined a workout and participated in the run. 
“Thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers are illegally held in captivity during an illegal war,” Snyder told The Associated Press just ahead of the run. “This race is about reminding everyone of that and expressing solidarity with Ukrainians and giving Ukrainians a chance to do something together,” he said.
The 5 and 10-kilometer runs took place around a sprawling park in the Ukrainian capital created out of a renovated Soviet-era exhibition center.
The runners included members of the public, servicepeople and veterans, as well as wives of the POWs. Among them was 27-year-old Anastasia Ofyl, whose husband Oleksandr was captured by the Russians. “We have to fight for him,” she said. “That’s why I’m running.”


Ukrainian soldiers often give harrowing accounts of their conditions in Russian captivity when they return home as part of regular prisoner exchanges.
In a report issued in July, a United Nations human rights agency said it “continued to document the widespread use of torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence, against civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war held by the Russian Federation.”
Snyder, who has organized fundraisers as part of the country’s war-relief effort, enjoys near-celebrity status in Ukraine. On Tuesday, he visited President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who thanked him for his charity work. The Ukrainian head of state also received former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the American actor Michael Douglas this week.
After Saturday’s race, Snyder was surrounded by admirers, many of whom waited in line for autographs and selfies. Some asked the historian to sign translated copies of his widely-read books on Ukraine, “Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin” and “The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America.”
Saturday’s race was organized by the Kyiv School of Economics’ charity foundation which, according to its website, has been raising funds for charitable assistance for Ukrainians since the start of the Russian invasion. ___ Alex Babenko and Dmytro Zhyhinas in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",False

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — The death toll from Typhoon Yagi and its subsequent rain that triggered floods and landslides climbed to 87 on Tuesday as 70 others remain missing and hundreds were injured, state media said.
Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit the Southeast Asian country in decades. It made landfall Saturday with winds of up to 149 kph (92 mph) and despite weakening on Sunday, downpours continued. 
Vietnamese state broadcaster VTV said floods and landslides caused most of the deaths. 
Water levels in several rivers, including the Red River that flows through the capital, Hanoi, were dangerously high, forcing authorities to evacuate people living close by. State media cited local officials saying Hanoi, Vietnam’s second-most populated city and home to 8.5 million people, experienced floods not seen since 2008.
Heavy rainfall and landslides killed 19 people in northwestern Lao Cai province bordering China. Video obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday showed soil sliding down a hill onto houses and a road while people fled for safety. Meanwhile, authorities said three people were rescued after a steel bridge crumpled the day before into the Red River in the province, while 13 others remain missing, according to state media.
Thousands of people were also evacuated in the mountainous province of Yen Bai because of rising floods, local media said, adding that at least 32 people had died and seven were missing. Authorities said over 10,000 homes in the province’s eponymous main city were completely inundated with floodwaters.
Blue Dragon Children’s Foundation said in a statement hundreds were displaced and isolated in the rocky provinces of Ha Giang and Dien Bien. It also said debris from landslides blocked the roads in Ha Giang while schools near rivers were shut because of flooding risk.


The nonprofit’s co-CEO, Skye Maconachie, said Vietnamese communities who were already vulnerable were the most impacted “as it often happens in disasters like this.”
One of the hardest-hit Vietnamese provinces is Cao Bang, where 19 people died and 36 others are missing because of landslides in the hilly area, and where a bridge collapsed and a bus was swept away, carrying about 20 people into a flooded stream on Monday. 
Yagi and its heavy rain also damaged factories in northern provinces like Haiphong.
Storms like Typhoon Yagi are “getting stronger due to climate change, primarily because warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel the storms, leading to increased wind speeds and heavier rainfall,” said Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.",False

Israel claimed the death of a senior Hezbollah military official after a rare Israeli airstrike on Beirut as the death toll rose Saturday to at least 37 people, with dozens more wounded, shortly after Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with 140 rockets.
The strikes are part of a new cycle of escalation between the enemies that has raised fears of a full-out war erupting in the Middle East, particularly after two separate attacks in Lebanon in which communication devices exploded simultaneously around the country, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others.
Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. 
Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory during the nearly 1-year-old Israel-Hamas war. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.
Here’s the latest:
BEIRUT —The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah announced a strike early Sunday on an Israeli military base near Haifa using a new missile type for the first time. Israel’s emergency medical services reported that a man was lightly wounded by shrapnel from a missile shot from Lebanon that was intercepted in a village in the lower Galilee.


Local media reported rockets shot from Lebanon were intercepted in the areas of Haifa and Nazareth. The Israeli military said only that it had monitored the launch of “about ten rockets” from Lebanon, of which most were intercepted.
“A rocket was also monitored falling in the area and the incident is being investigated,” the statement said.
Hezbollah said it had launched “dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles, in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.”
Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of apparently remotely detonated explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people - including two children - and wounding around 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility.
On Friday, an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs killed at least 37 people, including one of the militant group’s senior leaders as well as women and children, raising fears of a further escalation.
JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said that about 90 rockets had been fired at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday and that it struck more than 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon. 
It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was killed or wounded in the back-and-forth attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, which follow an Israeli strike on Beirut that killed a top Hezbollah commander on Friday. 
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli defense spokesperson, announced updated safety guidelines for areas north of Haifa, including caps on gatherings of 30 people in open spaces and 300 in enclosed spaces. Work and school can continue if people can reach protected areas promptly. In practice, the new guidelines likely mean school will be canceled in parts of the north, since students and teachers wouldn’t be able to reach shelters in the required time.
Within an hour of the announcement, Sunday classes were canceled in at least one border region in western Galilee. The cancellations include locations well outside the ordinary five-kilometer (three-mile) evacuation zone in northern Israel. 
TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s armed forces unveiled a new ballistic missile during an annual military parade Saturday amid tensions in the region.
State television reported that the missile, called Jahad, was a single-stage liquid-fuel ballistic missile with a high-explosive warhead, and it had a range of 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles), making it theoretically capable or reaching Israel.
Iran routinely unveils the technological achievements of its armed forces.
In April, it launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike that killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building in Syria. Israel said most of the missiles were intercepted.
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati says he will not go to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly because of the ongoing acts of violence with Israel.
Mikati’s office said the prime minister was scheduled to give Lebanon’s speech later this month at the United Nations but now he will discuss Lebanon’s diplomatic moves with Foreign Minster Abdallah Bouhabib who is currently in New York.
“There is no priority at the present time than stopping the massacres committed by the Israeli enemy,” Mikati was quoted as saying, a day after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed 37 people and wounded 68.
Mikati said he calls for drafting international laws that prevent the use of civilian technological devices for military purposes.
Mikati’s comments came days after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000 members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group. Israel was blamed for the attack.
WILMINGTON, Del. — White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the reported death of Ibrahim Akil “a good outcome” and said that he planned to speak with Israeli officials later Saturday about the operation.
Akil, the main target of the Friday strike, had been wanted by the U.S. for years for his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and in taking American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was under U.S. sanctions and in 2023, the U.S. State Department announced a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his “identification, location, arrest, and/or conviction.”
“That individual has American blood on his hands and has a rewards for justice price on his head,” Sullivan told reporters on the sidelines of the Quad summit that U.S. President Joe Biden is hosting in Wilmington, Delaware. “He is somebody who the United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see brought to justice.”
Sullivan added the moment was also meaningful for the American victims.
“You know 1983 seems like a long time ago,” Sullivan said. “But for a lot of families and a lot of people, they’re still living with it every day.”

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli fire killed 22 people in a strike on a school in the north of the enclave, the Gaza Health Ministry said on Saturday.
The strike on the school in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City injured another 30, the statement said.
Earlier Saturday, the Israeli army said it struck a Hamas “command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served” as a school.
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The death toll from an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb has risen to 31, including seven women and three children, Lebanon’s health minister said Saturday.
Firass Abiad told reporters that 68 people were also wounded in Friday’s airstrike, of whom 15 remain in hospital, in the deadliest Israeli strike on Beirut since the Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006. 
Among the dead was Ibrahim Akil, a Hezbollah commander who was in charge of the group’s elite Radwan Forces, and about a dozen members of the militant group who were meeting in the basement of the building that was destroyed.
Israel launched the rare airstrike in the densely populated southern Beirut neighborhood on Friday afternoon during the rush hour when people were returning home from work and students were leaving schools.
On Saturday morning, Hezbollah’s media office took journalists to the site of the airstrike where workers were still digging through the rubble.
Lebanese troops cordoned off the area around the building that was destroyed as members of the Lebanese Red Cross stood nearby to take any recovered bodies from under the rubble.
UNITED NATIONS — Weaponizing ordinary communication devices represents a new development in warfare, and targeting thousands of Lebanese people using pagers, two-way radios and electronic equipment without their knowledge is a violation of international human rights law, the United Nations human rights chief said Friday.
Volker Türk told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council there must be an independent and transparent investigation of the two attacks in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday where these devices exploded, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others.
“Those who ordered and carried out these attacks must be held to account,” he said.
Lebanon has blamed Israel for the attacks, which appeared to target Hezbollah militants but also saw many civilian casualties, including children. Hezbollah has fought many conflicts with Israel, including a war in 2006, and it has conducted near-daily strikes against Israel to support Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7. 
When reporters asked Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon about speculation Israel was behind the two explosions, he said: “We are not commenting.”",False

SUNGAI ABU, Indonesia (AP) — Mud, rugged terrain and lack of telecommunications hampered rescue efforts Saturday after a landslide set off by torrential rains smashed down into an unauthorized gold mining operation on Indonesia’s Sumatra Island, killing at least 12 people.
Villagers had been digging for grains of gold in the remote village in the Solok district of West Sumatra province when mud plunged down the surrounding hills and buried them on Thursday.
Several people managed to escape and some were pulled out by rescuers, said local search and rescue agency chief Abdul Malik. Eleven people were injured.
Malik said rescuers recovered 12 bodies, revising an earlier death toll of 15 after officials discovered that lack of communications and the remoteness of the village had affected the counting of the victims. Two other people are believed still missing under tons of mud, he said.
Rescuers earlier said the devastated area could only be reached by walking for four hours from the nearest settlement. 
“Relief efforts for the dead and missing were hampered by rugged terrain and blocked roads covered by thick mud and debris,” Malik said, adding that many residents also did not want outsiders, including search and rescue officers, to enter their traditional mining areas.
Informal mining operations are common in Indonesia, providing a tenuous livelihood to thousands who labor in conditions with a high risk of serious injury or death.


Landslides, flooding and collapses of tunnels are just some of the hazards facing miners. Much of gold ore processing involves highly toxic mercury and cyanide and workers frequently use little or no protection.
The country’s last major mining-related accident occurred in July when a landslide crashed onto an illegal traditional gold mine in Gorontalo province on Sulawesi island, killing at least 23 people.
In April 2022 a landslide hit another gold mine in North Sumatra’s Mandailing Natal district, killing 12 women.
In February 2019, a makeshift wooden structure in an illegal gold mine in North Sulawesi province collapsed partly due to shifting soil. More than 40 people were buried.

NEW YORK (AP) — Leonie Fiebich hit four 3-pointers and scored a career-high 21 points on 7-of-8 shooting, Breanna Stewart added 20 points and 11 rebounds and the New York Liberty never trailed Sunday in their 83-69 victory over the Atlanta Dream in Game 1 in the first round of the WNBA playoffs.
New York can sweep the best-of-three series with a win Tuesday in New York. Game 3, if necessary, is Thursday in Atlanta.
The Liberty — who made each of their first six field-goal attempts, including four 3-pointers — jumped to a 13-4 lead. Allisha Gray was fouled on a jumper and hit the and-1 free throw to cut Atlanta’s deficit to four with 5:33 left in the first quarter, but the Liberty scored the next 14 points — the final seven by Sabrina Ionescu — to take an 18-point lead. The Dream went scoreless for more than four minutes before Tina Charles hit a fade-away jumper to spark a 7-2 spurt that trimmed their deficit to 29-16 going into the second quarter. 
New York made 8 of 11 from the field, 5 of 6 from the 3-point range and 8 of 8 from the free-throw line while outrebounding the Dream 11-3 in the first period. Atlanta, which shot 35.3% (6 of 17) and went 0 for 6 from behind the arc, trailed by double figures for the final 33-plus minutes.
Rhyne Howard scored 14 points and Charles added 12 for Atlanta.
The Dream beat New York 78-67 on Thursday in the regular-season finale to clinch the eighth and final playoff spot — and a date with the top-seeded Liberty in the first round. Atlanta shot 50% (31 of 62) from the field.


Fiebich scored 15 points — one shy of the rookie’s season high — on perfect shooting in the first half, making 5 of 5 from the field, 2 of 2 from behind the arc and 3 of 3 from the free-throw line. Ionescu added 14 points and New York took a 48-30 lead into halftime.
The Liberty, who seek their first WNBA championship, made their fifth WNBA Finals appearance last season but lost 3-1 to the Las Vegas Aces.
New York’s Courtney Vandersloot had four points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals.
Ionescu finished with 17 points and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton scored 10 for the Liberty.

Publication date:2024-09-30 01:32:00

VIENNA (AP) — The Freedom Party secured the first far-right national parliamentary election victory in post-World War II Austria on Sunday, finishing ahead of the governing conservatives after tapping into anxieties about immigration, inflation, Ukraine and other issues. But its chances of governing were unclear.
Preliminary official results showed the Freedom Party finishing first with 29.2% of the vote and Chancellor Karl Nehammer’s Austrian People’s Party was second with 26.5%. The center-left Social Democrats were in third place with 21%. The outgoing government — a coalition of Nehammer’s party and the environmentalist Greens — lost its majority in the lower house of parliament. 
Herbert Kickl, a former interior minister and longtime campaign strategist who has led the Freedom Party since 2021, wants to be chancellor.
But to become Austria’s new leader, he would need a coalition partner to command a parliamentary majority. Rivals have said they won’t work with Kickl in government.
The far right has benefited from frustration over high inflation, the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also built on worries about migration.
In its election program, titled “Fortress Austria,” the Freedom Party calls for “remigration of uninvited foreigners,” for achieving a more “homogeneous” nation by tightly controlling borders and suspending the right to asylum via an emergency law.
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024
The Freedom Party also calls for an end to sanctions against Russia, is highly critical of Western military aid to Ukraine and wants to bow out of the European Sky Shield Initiative, a missile defense project launched by Germany. Kickl has criticized “elites” in Brussels and called for some powers to be brought back from the European Union to Austria.


“We don’t need to change our position, because we have always said that we’re ready to lead a government, we’re ready to push forward this change in Austria side by side with the people,” Kickl said in an appearance alongside other party leaders on ORF public television. “The other parties should ask themselves where they stand on democracy,” he added, arguing that they should “sleep on the result.”
Nehammer said it was “bitter” that his party missed out on first place, but noted he brought it back from lower poll ratings. He has often said he won’t form a coalition with Kickl and said that “what I said before the election, I also say after the election.”
More than 6.3 million people were eligible to vote for the new parliament in Austria, an EU member that has a policy of military neutrality.
Kickl has achieved a turnaround since Austria’s last parliamentary election in 2019. In June, the Freedom Party narrowly won a nationwide vote for the first time in the European Parliament election, which also brought gains for other European far-right parties. 
Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders, whose party dominates the Netherlands’ new government, congratulated the Freedom Party on social network X Sunday. So did Alice Weidel, a co-leader of the Alternative for Germany party.
The Freedom Party is a long-established force but Sunday’s result was its best yet in a national parliamentary election, beating the 26.9% it scored in 1999.
In 2019, its support slumped to 16.2% after a scandal brought down a government in which it was the junior partner. Then-vice chancellor and Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache resigned following the publication of a secretly recorded video in which he appeared to offer favors to a purported Russian investor.
The leader of the Social Democrats, a party that led many of Austria’s post-World War II governments, positioned himself as the polar opposite to Kickl. Andreas Babler ruled out governing with the far right and labeled Kickl “a threat to democracy.”
While the Freedom Party has recovered, the popularity of Nehammer’s People’s Party declined sharply compared with 2019. Support for the Greens, their coalition partner, also dropped to 8%.
During the election campaign, Nehammer portrayed his party, which has taken a tough line on immigration in recent years, as “the strong center” that would guarantee stability amid multiple crises. 
But crises ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resulting rising energy prices and inflation also cost it support. The government also angered many Austrians in 2022 with a short-lived coronavirus vaccine mandate, the first in Europe. 
But the recent flooding caused by Storm Boris that hit Austria and other countries may have helped Nehammer slightly narrow the gap as a crisis manager.
The People’s Party is the far right’s only way into government, and now holds the key to forming any administration.
Nehammer repeatedly excluded joining a government led by Kickl, describing him as a “security risk” for the country, but didn’t rule out a coalition with the Freedom Party itself — which would imply Kickl renouncing a position in government. But that looks very unlikely with the Freedom Party in first place.
The alternative would be an alliance between the People’s Party and the Social Democrats — with or without the liberal Neos, who took 9% of the vote.
A final official result will be published later in the week after a small number of remaining postal ballots have been counted, but those won’t change the outcome substantially.
About 300 protesters gathered outside the parliament building in Vienna Sunday evening, holding placards with slogans including “Kickl is a Nazi.”

Publication date:2024-09-15 07:00:00

LOS ANGELES (AP) — “Shogun” had historic wins in an epic 18-Emmy first season, “Hacks” scored an upset for best comedy on what was still a four-trophy night for “The Bear,” and “Baby Reindeer” had a holiday at an Emmy Awards that had some surprising swerves.

“Shogun,” the FX series about power struggles in feudal Japan, won best drama series, Hiroyuki Sanada won best actor in a drama, and Anna Sawai won best actress. Sanada was the first Japanese actor to win an Emmy. Sawai became the second just moments later. 

”‘Shogun’ taught me when we work together, we can make miracles,” Sanada said in his acceptance speech from the stage of the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. 

Along with 14 Emmys it claimed at the precursor Creative Arts Emmys, it had an unmatched performance with 18 overall for one season. 

“Hacks” was the surprise winner of its first best comedy series award, topping “The Bear,” which most had expected to take it after big wins earlier in the evening. 

Jean Smart won her third best actress in a comedy award for the third season of Max’s “Hacks,” in which her stand-up comic character Deborah Vance tries to make it in late-night TV. Smart has six Emmys overall.

Despite losing out on the night’s biggest comedy prize after winning it for its first season at January’s strike-delayed ceremony, FX’s “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White won best actor in a comedy for the second straight year, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach repeated as best supporting actor.



And Liza Colón-Zayas was the surprise best supporting actor winner over competition that included Meryl Streep, becoming the first Latina to win in the category.

“To all the Latinas who are looking at me,” she said, her eyes welling with tears. “keep believing, and vote.”

Netflix’s darkly quirky “Baby Reindeer” won best limited series. Creator and star Richard Gadd won for his lead acting and his writing and Jessica Gunning, who plays his tormentor, won best supporting actress. 

Accepting the series award, Gadd urged the makers of television to take chances. 

“The only constant across any success in television is good storytelling,” he said. “Good storytelling that speaks to our times. So take risks, push boundaries. Explore the uncomfortable. Dare to fail in order to achieve.”

“Baby Reindeer” is based on a one man-stage show in which Gadd describes being sexually abused along with other emotional struggles.

Accepting that award, he said, “no matter how bad it gets, it always gets better.”

The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Gadd has.

Jodie Foster won her first Emmy to go with her two Oscars when she took best actress in a limited series for “True Detective: Night Country.”

Foster played a salty police chief investigating a mass killing in the round-the-clock dark of an Alaskan winter on the HBO show. While her castmate Kali Reis missed out on becoming the first Indigenous actor to win an Emmy in the supporting category, Foster praised her, and the show’s collaboration with Indigenous contributors. 

“The Inupiaq and Inuit people of northern Alaska who told us their stories, and they allowed us to listen,” Foster said. “That was just a blessing. It was love, love, love, and when you feel that, something amazing happens.” 

Greg Berlanti, a producer and writer on shows including “Dawson’s Creek” and “Everwood,” received the Television Academy’s Governors Award for his career-long contributions to improving LGBTQ visibility on television. He talked about a childhood when there was little such visibility. 

“There wasn’t a lot of gay characters on television back then, and I was a closeted gay kid,” Berlanti said. “It’s hard to describe how lonely that was at the time,”

The long decline of traditional broadcast TV at the Emmys continued, with zero wins between the four broadcast networks. 

In the monologue that opened the ABC telecast, Dan Levy, who hosted with his father and “Schitt’s Creek” co-star Eugene Levy, called the Emmys “broadcast TV’s biggest night for honoring movie stars on streaming services.” 

Though other than Foster, movie stars didn’t fare too well. Her fellow Oscar winners Streep and Robert Downey Jr. had been among the favorites, but came up empty. 

“Robert Downey Jr. I have a poster of you in my house!” said Lamorne Morris, who beat Downey for best supporting actor in a limited series, said from the stage as he accepted his first Emmy.

The evening managed to meet many expectations but included several swerves like the win for “Hacks.” 

“We were really shocked,” “Hacks co-creator Jen Statsky, who also won for writing, said after the show. ”We were truly, really surprised.”

And “Shogun” got off to a quiet start, missing on early awards and not getting its first trophy until past the halfway point.

Still, it shattered the record for Emmys for one season previously held by the 2008 limited series “John Adams” in 2008. And its acting wins would have been hard to imagine before the series became an acclaimed phenomenon.

Sanada is a 63-year-old longtime screen star whose name is little known outside Japan, even if his face is through Hollywood films like “The Last Samurai” and “John Wick Chapter 4.” Sawai, 32, who was born in New Zealand and moved to Japan as a child, is significantly less known in the U.S. She wept when she accepted best actress. 

“When you saw me cry on stage, it was probably the 12th time I cried today,” Sawai said backstage. “It was just mixed emotions, wanting everyone to win all that. I may cry again now.”

“The Bear” would finish second with 11 overall Emmys, including guest acting wins at the Creative Arts ceremony for Jamie Lee Curtis and Jon Bernthal.

The Levys in their opening monologue mocked the show being in the comedy category.

“In honor of ‘The Bear’ we will be making no jokes,” Eugene Levy said, to laughs.

Elizabeth Debicki took best supporting actress in a drama for playing Princess Diana at the end of her life in the sixth and final season of “The Crown.” 

“Playing this part, based on this unparalleled, incredible human being, has been my great privilege,” Debicki said in her acceptance. “It’s been a gift.” 

Several awards were presented by themed teams from TV history, including sitcom dads George Lopez, Damon Wayans and Jesse Tyler Ferguson and TV moms Meredith Baxter, Connie Britton, and Susan Kelechi Watson.

BERLIN (AP) — Lawmakers elected a mainstream conservative as speaker of the state parliament in eastern Germany’s Thuringia region on Saturday, putting aside a convention that the strongest party gets the job after the far-right Alternative for Germany won a regional election for the first time.
The center-right Christian Democratic Union’s Thadäus König was elected in a parliamentary session that stretched over two days, punctuated by a court ruling against the conduct of the far-right politician who chaired the proceedings. 
It underlined the prospect of a very bumpy parliamentary term after the Sept. 1 election in which Alternative for Germany, or AfD, finished first with nearly one-third of the vote — the first far-right win in a state election in post-World War II Germany. However, it fell well short of a majority, and no other party wants to govern with it.
The legislature in Erfurt was supposed to elect its speaker on Thursday. In Thuringia, as in other German states, the first session after an election is chaired by the oldest lawmaker — in this case, AfD’s Jürgen Treutler. 
Treutler drew criticism in a turbulent and often-interrupted meeting for refusing to allow lawmakers to speak, put forward motions or debate allowing all parties, not just AfD, to put forward candidates for the speaker’s job. 
The CDU protested to Thuringia’s constitutional court, which ruled Friday that the rules of procedure can be changed before a speaker is elected. 


In a calmer session Saturday, lawmakers elected König over AfD candidate Wiebke Muhsal by 54 votes to 32, with one abstention. AfD has 32 lawmakers. 
By convention, thought not by law, the speaker’s job usually goes to the strongest party. But other parties had said they wouldn’t elect an AfD candidate and also objected to Muhsal, as she was fined for fraud years ago. 
It remains to be seen whether and when parties will manage to put together a state government. No one wants to work with AfD. The domestic intelligence agency has the party’s Thuringia branch, led by prominent hard-right figure Björn Höcke, under official surveillance as a “proven right-wing extremist” group. 
The only alternative is an improbable alliance of the CDU, a new party led by a prominent leftist and the center-left Social Democrats. That would be one seat short of a majority and would probably need some kind of help from the Left Party, which has communist roots.",False

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran launched a satellite into space Saturday with a rocket built by the country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, state-run media reported, the latest for a program the West fears helps Tehran advance its ballistic missile program. 
Iran described the launch as the second such launch to put a satellite into orbit with the rocket. Independent scientists later confirmed the launch and that the satellite reached orbit.
Footage later released by Iranian media showed the rocket blast off from a mobile launcher. An Associated Press analysis of the video and other imagery later released suggested the launch happened at the Guard’s launch pad on the outskirts of the city of Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) east of the capital, Tehran. 
The launch comes amid heightened tensions gripping the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, during which Tehran launched an unprecedented direct missile-and-drone attack on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium to nearly weapons-grade levels, raising concerns among nonproliferation experts about Tehran’s program. 
Iran identified the satellite-carrying rocket as the Qaem-100, which the Guard used in January for another successful launch. Qaem means “upright” in Iran’s Farsi language. 
The solid-fuel, three-stage rocket put the Chamran-1 satellite, weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds), into a 550-kilometer (340-mile) orbit, state media reported. The rocket bore a Quranic verse: “That which is left by Allah is better for you, if you are believers.”


A state-owned subsidiary of Iran’s Defense Ministry and experts at the Aerospace Research Institute built the satellite with others to “test hardware and software systems for orbital maneuver technology validation,” state media said, without elaborating.
Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, praised the launch in a statement and said scientists successfully overcame “the atmosphere of extensive and oppressive international sanctions.”
Responding to questions from The Associated Press, the U.S. State Department said it has “long made clear our concern that Iran’s space launch vehicle programs provide a pathway to expand its longer-range missile systems.”
“We continue to use a variety of nonproliferation tools, in coordination with our allies and partners, to counter the further advancement of Iran’s ballistic missile program and its ability to proliferate missiles and related technology,” it added.
The United States had previously said Iran’s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran’s ballistic missile program expired last October.
Under Iran’s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protege of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, has pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May. 
It’s unclear what Iran’s new president, the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, wants for the program as he was silent on the issue while campaigning. 
The U.S. intelligence community’s worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran’s development of satellite launch vehicles “would shorten the timeline” for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology.
Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for “several” nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned.
Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.
The launch also came ahead of the second anniversary of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, which sparked nationwide protests against Iran’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law and the country’s Shiite theocracy.

CHICAGO (AP) — This wasn’t exactly the debut Caleb Williams envisioned. Good thing for him, his defense made just enough plays.
Tyrique Stevenson returned an interception 43 yards for the go-ahead touchdown, part of a defensive performance that bailed out Williams, and the Chicago Bears beat the Tennessee Titans 24-17 on Sunday.
The Bears, who have their sights set on a playoff spot after going 10-24 over the previous two seasons, rallied from a 17-0 first-half deficit, and they did it without a touchdown from their revamped offense. They shut down the Titans over the final two quarters and spoiled the debut of Tennessee coach Brian Callahan.
“It was a frustrating game,” Williams said. “But the most important thing is that it shows a bunch of the personality of this team, I would say — the fight, the resiliency that we had.”
It was frustrating for Tennessee, too. The Titans shut down Chicago’s offense, only to give up 17 points off turnovers.
“It was a winning effort on defense,” Callahan said. “They did a really nice job. They made life hard for those guys, exactly how we wanted to. And we just handed them points.”
Williams, the No. 1 overall pick, finished 14 of 29 for 93 yards with a 55.7 passer rating. The former Heisman Trophy winner at Southern California still became the first quarterback drafted first overall to win his initial start since 2002, when David Carr led Houston past Dallas. The past 15 No. 1 picks were a combined 0-14-1 in first starts, beginning with Cincinnati’s Carson Palmer in 2003.


The Bears had just cut it to 17-16 on a field goal by Cairo Santos when Stevenson put Chicago on top midway through the fourth quarter. With DeMarcus Walker about to sack him, Will Levis flung the ball in desperation. Stevenson grabbed it and ran untouched down the sideline for his first first career touchdown. A 2-point conversion pass from Williams to D’Andre Swift made it 24-17.

Jaylon Johnson sealed the win with just over a minute remaining when he intercepted a deep pass intended for Tyler Boyd on fourth down at the Tennessee 40, giving fans who spent a big portion of the afternoon booing a reason to cheer.
In the Super Bowl era, teams that scored zero touchdowns and trailed by 17 or more points are 3-1,225. Two of those wins are by Chicago, with the 2006 team beating Arizona. The other was by Kansas City against Carolina in 2016.
“It’s one hell of a team, a team full of dogs,” Stevenson said. “At some point it’s going to be them helping us out. It is what it is. We still got the win. I’m happy for the boys.”
With Williams struggling with his accuracy, Chicago’s vaunted receiving corps was quiet, too. DJ Moore caught five passes for 36 yards. Keenan Allen had 29 yards receiving in his Bears debut, and rookie Rome Odunze caught just one pass for 11 yards.
Chicago finished with 148 yards of offense and got its only other touchdown on special teams. Daniel Hardy blocked a punt in the third quarter, and Jonathan Owens recovered and returned it 21 yards for a score that got the Bears within 17-10.
Owens’ play drew a roar from the crowd and delighted his wife, star gymnast Simone Biles, who answered “I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK” in response to a post on X asking how she felt. His first touchdown as a Bear after playing for Green Bay last season came about five weeks after he took time away from training camp to watch her capture three more Olympic gold medals and a silver in Paris.
“It felt amazing,” Owens said. “Going back to the sideline, all the guys are excited for you. The defense is excited. The energy from the stadium is just rolling in. It didn’t feel like real life.”
Santos cut it to 17-13 early in the fourth with a 50-yard field goal. The Bears then had a huge opportunity when Darrell Taylor strip-sacked Levis and T.J. Edwards recovered at the Tennessee 31, only to settle for another field goal that made it a one-point game.
Levis was 19 of 32 for 127 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions to start his second season. Tony Pollard ran for 82 yards and a TD for Tennessee.
“We just got to be better,” Levis said. “That’s not us. That first half was a winning offensive football game. Second half, that can lose you games. Not good across the board.” 
Callahan said the Titans did not have any major injuries. RG Dillon Radunz (ribs) was hurt blocking on a pass play early in the third quarter but returned.
Titans: Host the New York Jets on Sunday.
Bears: Visit Houston on Sunday night. ___

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — When it comes to the niche business of moving elephants, Dr. Amir Khalil and his team might be the best.
The Egyptian veterinarian’s résumé includes possibly the most famous elephant relocation on the planet. In 2020, Khalil’s team saved Kaavan, an Asian elephant, from years of loneliness at a Pakistan zoo and flew him to a better life with other elephants at a sanctuary in Cambodia.
Kaavan was dubbed the “world’s loneliest elephant” at the time, and the project was a great success. But he was not the only one that needed help.
Next up was the last captive elephant in South Africa.

Charley, an aging four-ton African elephant, had outlived his fellow elephants at a zoo in the capital, Pretoria, where he’d stayed for more than 20 years. Elephants are sensitive animals, wildlife experts say, and Charley was showing signs of being deeply unhappy in his enclosure since his partner, Landa, died in 2020. 
Zoo officials decided he should be “retired” to a place more fitting for a big old tusker — a large private game reserve some 200 kilometers (120 miles) away where there’s a chance he might make some new elephant friends.
How to get him there? Khalil, an animal rescue specialist at the Four Paws wildlife welfare organization, was an obvious choice for this latest mammoth job.
If ever an elephant deserved to enjoy his twilight years, it’s Charley.


Captured as a young calf in western Zimbabwe in the 1980s and taken from his herd, he spent 16 years in a South African circus and 23 years as the prime attraction at Pretoria’s National Zoological Garden. He’s thought to be 42 years old now and spent 40 of them in captivity.
“I don’t know how many hundreds of thousands of people and children witnessed and enjoyed Charley,” said Khalil. “I think it’s time for him to also enjoy life and to live as an elephant.”
The mechanics of moving an elephant to a new life are complex. Khalil doesn’t dart and tranquilize elephants, mainly because it’s not good for such a big animal. Also, four tons of tranquilized elephant is hardly any easier to move. 
And so, a process began of training an occasionally grumpy old elephant to step willingly into a large metal transport container that would be loaded onto a truck. Khalil and fellow vets Dr. Marina Ivanova and Dr. Frank Göritz — who were also part of the Kaavan relocation team — first began interacting with Charley two years ago.

(Four Paws via AP)
That was to assess how ready he was to move and, crucially, to earn his trust. The interaction was carefully controlled, but it involved teaching Charley to respond to calls to walk up to a “training wall” that has gaps in it for the team to offer him a food reward. In Charley’s case, pumpkins, papaya and beetroot are his favorites.
The same process was ultimately used to entice Charley into the transport container. It was thought that it might take months and months for Charley to step happily into the container when that was introduced, but he was ready to go in less than two weeks of crate training last month.
“He was curious, and thinking, what is this new toy?” said Ivanova.
After an hourslong road trip on the back of a truck, Charley was introduced to his new home at the Shambala private game reserve in late August. 
He’ll be held in an area separate from the main park for a few weeks to allow him to settle, the team said, given such a huge change for an old elephant. The park contains wild elephant herds that Charley may join up with.
Khalil said it is still very rare for captive elephants to be reintroduced to a wild setting and praised officials at the Pretoria zoo and South Africa’s environment ministry for allowing this project to go ahead. “It’s a great message from South Africa that even an old elephant deserves a new chance,” he said. 
Khalil’s team has another elephant move in Pakistan planned for October.

Elephants are highly intelligent, highly social animals, Khalil said, and while Charley was unhappy, he could also be mischievous and playful and show glimpses of delight. Khalil compared Charley’s last few unfulfilling years at the zoo without any companions to someone watching the same movie every day, alone.
At Shambala, Charley will have the freedom to take a mud bath, roam the bush and be a wild elephant for the first time in four decades with thousands of hectares (acres) to explore. Some of his early memories as a calf before he was captured may still be there. It is true, the vets said, that elephants have incredible memories.
Charley is already making contact with the other elephants out in the park from his holding pen, Ivanova said. Elephants have deep rumbles that can be heard 3 miles (5 kilometers) away that they use to communicate.
“I hear him rumbling,” said Ivanova, delighted. “We’ll help him turn into a wild elephant again.”

TOKYO (AP) — Fiji stretched its Pacific Nations Cup rugby defense to the final after topping the United States by a hard-fought 22-3 on Saturday.
The U.S. started and finished well but wasn’t clinical, while Fiji dominated the second and third quarters to put their first meeting in 10 years beyond doubt in a humid Prince Chichibu Memorial Stadium.
Japan and Samoa meet in the second semifinal in the same stadium on Sunday to decide who plays Fiji in the final next weekend in Osaka.
Fiji moved up a gear after the water break midway through the first half. Flanker Meli Derenalagi was denied a try by Eagles No. 8 Thomas Tu’avao, but Fiji leveled with a penalty by the inventive Caleb Muntz.
Fiji forced an attacking lineout but the U.S. stole the throw-in. But Fiji tacklers backpedalled the U.S. and they blew the Americans off a tryline ruck for No. 8 Elia Canakaivala to score. Muntz’s conversion made it 10-3 after an even first half.
The U.S. scrum was under pressure that wouldn’t ease until the last quarter but its scrambling defense was keeping it in the game.
That was until wing Vuate Karawalevu slipped a tackle and two passes later Canakaivata swan-dived to his second try.
While captain and hooker Tevita Ikanivere was in the sin-bin for a dangerous clearout, teammate Ilaisa Droasese broke on the left wing and replacement prop Peni Ravai rumbled down the right touch and looked set to score. But Ravai, in his 50th test, tripped himself and Karawalevu was on hand to give scrumhalf Frank Lomani the third and last try.",False

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — When Mississippi wins the coin toss, coach Lane Kiffin said he’s almost always going to elect to receive.
That mentality sits just fine with quarterback Jaxson Dart.
Dart completed his first three passes on the opening drive, leading the Rebels 75 yards in five plays for a touchdown that set the tone on Saturday as the No. 5 Rebels rolled to a 40-6 win at Wake Forest.
“I love it, I love it,” Dart said. “It gives you the chance to set the mark on the game. I think when you play a tempo team like us, and we choose to take the ball and go down the field and score right away that can be demoralizing for a defense. You want to make a statement. I think that speaks to the confidence coach Kiffin has in us.”
The senior quarterback passed for 377 yards and two touchdowns and Henry Parrish Jr. rushed for 148 yards and two TDs. Dart was 26 for 34, and he also had a 13-yard touchdown run.
Tre Harris had another monster game with 11 catches for 127 yards, and Jordan Watkins caught a 75-yard TD pass as the Rebels (3-0) outgained the Demon Deacons 650-311.
The Rebels defense limited Wake Forest (1-2) to 46 yards on the ground on 32 carries and kept their third straight opponent out of the end zone. The Demon Deacons only had one run longer than 10 yards — and that resulted in a fumble by Ty Clark.
Hank Bachmeier finished 22-of-39 passing for 239 yards for Wake Forest.


“Ole Miss ... they are what everyone thinks they are,” said Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson, whose team failed to score a touchdown for the first time since a 52-3 loss to Clemson on Nov. 6, 2019. “I thought our guys played really hard but Ole Miss is well-coached, they have a lot of resources and they’ve used those resources really well to put together a top five team.”
Mississippi opened the season with victories over Furman and Middle Tennessee State by a combined 125 points, and it didn’t take long to flex its muscles in its first test against a major conference opponent.
There was some adversity along the way as the Rebels overcame two turnovers and some costly penalties. The Rebels were penalized 11 times for 114 yards, including a 15-yard penalty on Dart for taking off his helmet in the field of play after being hit at the goal line.
“I felt like this is what we needed as a team,” Dart said. “I felt like it was the ugliest 600-yard game we could play. We did a lot of really good things and at times didn’t finish. But you saw how explosive we are, too.”
The Rebels opening drive was impressive as Dart went 3 for 3 for 46 yards before Parrish capped it off with a 25-yard touchdown run.
The Rebels were just getting started.
Dart was 10 of 13 for 198 yards in the first quarter alone, showing off his arm strength on Watkins’ big play as Ole Miss built 20-3 lead. Parrish also had a 22-yard TD run as the Rebels outgained the Deacons 282-57 in the opening quarter.
“I get nervous when we go into an environment like this,” Kiffin said. “If you don’t start early they get some momentum and you end up going through the motions. But that did not seem to be the case. We started fast on defense and offense, and I was really pleased with that.”
Dart made a mistake in the third quarter when he forced a ball into traffic while rolling out to his left and was intercepted in his own territory. But the Mississippi defense bailed him out, forcing an incompletion on fourth-and-goal from the 3 to maintain a 17-point lead.
Dart capitalized on the next series, scoring on a quarterback draw to make it 30-6. He finished with 36 yards rushing on six carries.
Harris was again huge in the receiving game for Mississippi. He has 28 receptions for 426 yards and two touchdowns in three games.
On Mississippi’s second drive, Kiffin sent in senior defensive tackle JJ Pegues to run the football and the 6-foot-2, 325-pounder didn’t disappoint, diving headfirst over the pile — picking up some serious air along the way — to get the first down.
Pegues came into the game with two carries for 12 yards and a touchdown.
Mississippi: Dart looks like a Heisman Trophy candidate, showing pinpoint accuracy on his throws, and, other than the one interception, solid decision-making. Wake Forest was forced to honor Dart’s arm, which opened up inside runs for Parrish on his two long TDs.
Wake Forest: The Demon Deacons had only beaten one top five team in school history, and it was clear early on the Rebels weren’t going to be the second. The Deacons struggled to run the ball and couldn’t find a rhythm on offense and failed to take advantage of two turnovers.
Mississippi: Hosts Georgia Southern on Saturday in its final game before beginning Southeastern Conference play.
Wake Forest: Have a weekend off before hosting Louisiana on Sept. 28.

PERRY, Fla. (AP) — Authorities struggled to get water and other supplies to isolated, flood-stricken areas across the U.S. Southeast in the wake of Hurricane Helene as the death toll from the storm rose to nearly 100.
A North Carolina county that includes the mountain city of Asheville reported 30 people killed due to the storm, and several other fatalities reported in North Carolina Sunday pushed the overall death toll to at least 91 people across several states.
Supplies were being airlifted to the region around the isolated city. Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder pledged that she would have food and water into Ashville — which is known for its arts, culture and natural attractions — by Monday.
“We hear you. We need food and we need water,” Pinder said on a Sunday call with reporters. “My staff has been making every request possible to the state for support and we’ve been working with every single organization that has reached out. What I promise you is that we are very close.”
Officials warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes and property would be lengthy and difficult. The storm upended life throughout the Southeast. Deaths also were reported in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia.
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper predicted the toll would rise as rescuers and other emergency workers reached areas isolated by collapsed roads, failing infrastructure and widespread flooding.


He implored residents in western North Carolina to avoid travel, both for their own safety and to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles. More than 50 search teams spread throughout the region in search of stranded people.
One rescue effort involved saving 41 people north of Asheville. Another mission focused on saving a single infant. The teams found people through both 911 calls and social media messages, North Carolina National Guard Adjutant General Todd Hunt said.
President Joe Biden described the impact of the storm as “stunning” and said he would visit the area this week as long as it does not disrupt rescues or recovery work.
Hurricane Helene roared ashore late Thursday in Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane with 140 mph (225 kph) winds. A weakened Helene quickly moved through Georgia, then soaked the Carolinas and Tennessee with torrential rains that flooded creeks and rivers and strained dams.
There have been hundreds of water rescues, including in rural Unicoi County in East Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were plucked by helicopter from a hospital rooftop Friday. 
More than 2 million homeowners and other utility customers were still without power Sunday night. South Carolina had the most outages and Gov. Henry McMaster asked for patience as crews dealt with widespread snapped power poles.
“We want people to remain calm. Help is on the way, it is just going to take time,” McMaster told reporters outside the airport in Aiken County.
The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina. One community, Spruce Pine, was doused with over 2 feet (61 centimeters) of rain from Tuesday through Saturday.
Jessica Drye Turner in Texas had begged for someone to rescue her family members stranded on their rooftop in Asheville amid rising floodwaters. “They are watching 18-wheelers and cars floating by,” Turner wrote in an urgent Facebook post on Friday.
But in a follow-up message Saturday, Turner said help had not arrived in time to save her parents, both in their 70s, and her 6-year-old nephew. The roof collapsed and the three drowned.
“I cannot convey in words the sorrow, heartbreak and devastation my sisters and I are going through,” she wrote.
The state was sending water supplies and other items toward Buncombe County and Asheville, but mudslides blocking Interstate 40 and other highways prevented supplies from making it. The county’s own water supplies were on the other side of the Swannanoa River, away from where most of the 270,000 people in Buncombe County live, officials said.
Law enforcement was making plans to send officers to places that still had water, food or gas because of reports of arguments and threats of violence, the county sheriff said.
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell toured south Georgia on Sunday and planned to be in North Carolina Monday.
“It’s still very much an active search and rescue mission” in western North Carolina, Criswell said. “And we know that there’s many communities that are cut off just because of the geography” of the mountains, where damage to roads and bridges have cut off certain areas.
Biden on Saturday pledged federal government help for Helene’s “overwhelming” devastation. He also approved a disaster declaration for North Carolina, making federal funding available for affected individuals.

In Florida’s Big Bend, some lost nearly everything they own. With sanctuaries still darkened as of Sunday morning, some churches canceled regular services while others like Faith Baptist Church in Perry opted to worship outside.
Standing water and tree debris still covers the grounds of Faith Baptist Church. The church called on parishioners to come “pray for our community” in a message posted to the congregation’s Facebook page.
“We have power. We don’t have electricity,” Immaculate Conception Catholic Church parishioner Marie Ruttinger said. “Our God has power. That’s for sure.”
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Saturday that it looked “like a bomb went off” after viewing splintered homes and debris-covered highways from the air.
In eastern Georgia near the border with South Carolina, officials notified Augusta residents Sunday morning that water service would be shut off for 24 to 48 hours in the city and surrounding Richmond County.
A news release said trash and debris from the storm “blocked our ability to pump water.” Officials were distributing bottled water.
With at least 25 killed in South Carolina, Helene was the deadliest tropical cyclone for the state since Hurricane Hugo made landfall north of Charleston in 1989, killing 35 people.
Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in property damage.
Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful cyclones sometimes within hours. 
A new tropical depression in the eastern Atlantic Ocean could become a “formidable hurricane” later this week, the National Hurricane Center said Sunday. The depression had sustained 35 mph (55kph) winds and was located about 585 miles (945 kilometers) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands, the center said. It could become a hurricane by Wednesday.

BOSTON (AP) — The struggling Minnesota Twins were swept in a split doubleheader against Boston on Sunday, when Romy Gonzalez hit a three-run homer and drove in four runs in the nightcap to lead the Red Sox to a 9-3 victory.
Losing for the 13th time in 19 games, the Twins fell a game behind both Detroit and Kansas City for the AL’s final two wild-card spots. They own the tiebreaker over both. All three teams have six games left to play.
“We do feel like we’re in a funk and we’re not scoring the runs we need to. We know what it feels like, we know what it looks like. We’ve done it many times before,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “There’s no way to force it in our game. You can’t make it happen, you can’t put the ball in the best player’s hands. You have to do it as a team. ... We’re thinking about this. That’s all I think about. I go to bed every night thinking about this all the time.” 
Minnesota (81-75) is just 11-22 since going 17 games over .500 on Aug. 17.
“It was an especially tough day today, we lost both games,″ Twins first baseman Carlos Santana said in a quiet clubhouse. ”We go back home, six more games left and try to finish strong. We have to finish strong.″ 
The Red Sox won for just the ninth time in 23 games to get back to .500 (78-78) after fading in the playoff chase. They’re only 24-36 since the All-Star break.
In the opener, Triston Casas homered in his first three at-bats and drove in seven runs, carrying the Red Sox to an 8-1 victory.


With the Twins leading the second game 2-0 in the fifth, Gonzalez’s sent his three-run drive into the Green Monster seats in deep left-center off Cole Irvin (6-6).
Jarren Duran had a two-run double off the Monster in Boston’s six-run sixth that increased it to 9-2. Gonzalez added a sacrifice fly, and Masataka Yoshida and Connor Wong both had an RBI single. 
Kutter Crawford (9-15) pitched a career-high 7 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and eight hits with seven strikeouts and no walks.
Minnesota’s Kyle Farmer extended his hitting streak to 13 games.
The nightcap was the makeup from Saturday’s rainout.
With a chance at tying history and the crowd cheering in the first game, the 24-year-old Casas grounded out in his fourth at-bat. He never got up again.
“I felt the most locked in I have all season,” Casas said. “I wasn’t going in with the intention to beat the ball to a spot. I was reacting to where it was, and keeping my posture and letting the bat go over the right part of the plate.”
The record for homers in a game is four, and it’s been done 18 times in MLB history.
The last to hit four in a game was J.D. Martinez, on Sept. 4, 2017, when he was playing for Arizona against the Los Angeles Dodgers. No AL player has done it since Josh Hamilton, playing for Texas, did it against the Baltimore Orioles May 8, 2012.
Casas’ first came with two runners on off a first-pitch fastball from Pablo López (15-9) in the opening inning and sailed an estimated 400 feet, landing in the seats behind Boston’s bullpen. His second — also off López — was an opposite field drive into the Monster seats in the third, also with two runners on that made it 6-0. Casas’ third was on the first pitch from reliever Brent Headrick leading off the fifth inning that gave the Red Sox an 8-1 lead.
Nick Pivetta (6-11) gave up an unearned run in five innings.
López was tagged for seven runs and nine hits in four innings. He had allowed two or fewer runs in 10 of his last 12 starts.
“There’s no sugar-coating it. Not the performance I was looking for, especially with what this game means,” he said. “Didn’t provide the length, didn’t provide the quality.”
Red Sox manager Alex Cora was ejected in the first inning. He became irate after the umpiring crew came together and decided to allow Byron Buxton to advance to third on an interference call at second on a pickoff attempt.
Red Sox: OF Tyler O’Neill didn’t play because he’s been dealing with back tightness.
Twins: RHP Bailey Ober (12-7, 3.84 ERA) is set to start the opener of a three-game series Tuesday at home against Miami. LHP Ryan Weathers (3-6, 3.94) is set for the Marlins.
Red Sox: Open their final road series Monday in Toronto. RHP Tanner Houck (8-10, 3.21) is slated to start against Blue Jays RHP Chris Bassitt (10-13, 4.16).

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnamese authorities say Typhoon Yagi has killed at least four people and injured 78 others after making landfall Saturday afternoon in the north of the country. 
Yagi, described by Vietnamese meteorological officials as “one of the most powerful typhoons in the region over the past decade,” made its way to the Southeast Asian country after it left three people dead and nearly a hundred others injured in the Chinese province of Hainan.
The typhoon landed at Vietnam’s coastal provinces of Quang Ninh and Haiphong with wind speeds of up to 149 kilometers per hour (92 miles per hour), state media reported. Before landing, strong winds felled a tree, killing a woman in the capital, Hanoi, local media said Saturday.
Quang Ninh is home to the UNESCO World Heritage site Ha Long Bay, known for its many towering limestone islands. Hundreds of cruises were canceled at the popular site before the typhoon landed, according to local media. Haiphong is an industrial hub, home to large factories, including EV maker VinFast and Apple supplier Pegatron.
The typhoon has also triggered power outages in large parts of Quang Ninh and Thai Binh provinces.
Earlier, the government issued several alerts, and those vulnerable to floods or landslides were evacuated. Four airports were shuttered, including in Hanoi, and Haiphong. 
Authorities pruned trees in Hanoi to make them less susceptible to falling, but wind and rain knocked over several along with billboards in northern cities. Local media reported that many moored boats were swept out to sea. 


“I am going to stay inside and try and stay safe with my family,” said Bao Ngoc Cao, 24, a businesswoman from Hanoi. She added that the last time a typhoon this strong hit Vietnam was in 2013 and that storms usually weaken before reaching the capital. “But we still need to be prepared.”
On Friday afternoon, Yagi struck the Chinese city of Wenchang in Hainan province with wind speeds of up to about 245 kph (152 mph) near its center. Authorities said the typhoon left three people dead and nearly a hundred others injured in the province. It has affected over 1.2 million people as of noon Saturday, according to the local Global Times newspaper.
Some 420,000 Hainan residents were relocated before the typhoon’s landfall. Another half a million people in Guangdong province were evacuated before Yagi made a second landfall in the province’s Xuwen County on Friday night.
Meanwhile, the meteorological observatory of the city of Haikou downgraded its typhoon signal from red to orange on Saturday, as it moved further away. 
Before leaving Hong Kong, Yagi forced more than 270 people to seek refuge at temporary government shelters on Friday, and over 100 flights in the city were canceled due to the typhoon. Heavy rain and strong winds felled dozens of trees, and trading on the stock market, bank services and schools were halted.
Yagi was still a storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people dead and 26 others missing mostly in landslides and widespread flooding and affecting more than 2.3 million people in northern and central provinces.
More than 82,200 people were displaced from their homes in Philippine provinces, and classes, work, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were disrupted for days, including in the densely populated capital region, metropolitan Manila.
Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore said that storms like typhoon Yagi were “getting stronger due to climate change, primarily because warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel the storms, leading to increased wind speeds and heavier rainfall.”
Climate change was also causing storms to potentially move to different locations with studies by the observatory showing that the latitude where storms peaked in their intensity was shifting, exposing newer areas to the impacts of storms, he added.
Horton said that protecting natural systems ranging from reefs to rivers while building structures that were more resilient to strong winds and flying debris and improving existing infrastructure were all measures that could help countries better deal with strong typhoons.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper and his wife Nicole have made an initial $3 million commitment to Hurricane Helene relief efforts through their foundation. 
It’s to support immediate and long-term humanitarian aid and recovery efforts in North and South Carolina in the wake of devastation from the Category 4 storm.
The region remains in a state of emergency, and more than 50 people have died.
“The David & Nicole Tepper Foundation, Carolina Panthers, and Charlotte FC stand alongside all those who have been affected by Hurricane Helene and the devastation it has wrought across the southeast, and particularly in our backyard throughout the Carolinas,” said David and Nicole Tepper said in a release.
Tepper purchased the Panthers in 2018. The foundation will assist a number of food banks and pantries, local community foundations and other service agencies in the Carolinas.
“This is our home and we are committed to supporting relief efforts throughout the region by providing critical resources and aiding the efforts of our heroic first responders,” the Teppers said. “The impact on our community has been severe, but Carolinians are resilient and courageous, and together, we will rebuild and recover.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz munched on a pork chop on a stick and washed it down with a vanilla shake Sunday as the Minnesota governor and his family visited his home state fair. 
Flanked by his wife, Gwen, and their daughter, Hope, and with a security detail trailing behind, Walz eyed rows of food vendors offering all manner of fair delicacies, many served on a stick. 
“For those not from Minnesota, just to be clear, there’s a lot of great state fairs in the country, this is the best one,” Walz said. “I can say that having tried pork chops in Iowa.”
The annual 12-day fair is an opportunity for Minnesota farmers to showcase their products. Walz highlighted the state’s agricultural sector as he made his way past booths with signs like “PUT SOME PORK ON YOUR FORK” and “#PORKPROUD.” 
Cheering fairgoers crowded around to shake hands with Walz and snap photos. 
Walz acknowledged that his status as Kamala Harris’ running mate may have caused more disruption than usual at an already packed fairgrounds in Falcon Heights, a St. Paul suburb. But he said the increased attention gave him a chance to promote Minnesota’s economy and culture. 
“I think people are seeing that we’re getting to talk about Minnesota across the country, talk about the economy here, talk about things like the state fair, talk about agriculture,” Walz said.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — Neither Georgia players nor coach Kirby Smart doubted they would be the last ones standing in a dogfight with Kentucky.
It just took the top-ranked Bulldogs longer than expected to prove it. Much longer. 
Branson Robinson rushed for a 3-yard, go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter, and Georgia overcame a lethargic performance to rally past and then hold off Kentucky 13-12 on Saturday night.
The Bulldogs (3-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) struggled to find continuity on either side of the ball and trailed 9-3 early in the third quarter against a Wildcats squad intent on rebounding from their own flat effort in a 31-6 home loss to conference-rival South Carolina. Peyton Woodring’s 30-yard field goal late in the third quarter got Georgia within three before the ‘Dawgs followed with their longest drive of the night at just the right time. 
Trevor Etienne’s 12-yard run, 11-yard reception and 8-yard rush got the Bulldogs to the Kentucky 29. The Florida transfer then broke right for a 17-yard run to the 11, stepping out of bounds as he tip-toed down the sideline trying to reach the end zone. Robinson took it in from there three plays later for Georgia’s first lead at 13-9.
“Trevor was gassed and we sent Branson in there,” coach Kirby Smart said. “He had a little juice, makes people miss and (it was) a really physical run.”
The Wildcats weren’t done, answering with Alex Raynor’s 51-yard field goal to get within a point. His school-record 55-yard kick gave Kentucky the initial lead, and he added two more from 32 and 40 yards for an advantage that held for more than three quarters — though not enough to put Georgia away. Kentucky (1-2, 0-2) got the ball one final time at its 20 with 9 seconds left but could only gain 17 yards on two plays before time ran out.


“So proud of the resiliency our kids showed,” added Smart, whose team beat Kentucky for the 15th consecutive time. “They never flinched. We thought this would be a blow-by-blow game. We talked all week about blow by blow, delivering more blows than them. We said the first chop of the tree doesn’t chop the tree down. It takes sometimes 272 ax chops, and it took every single one tonight to get the job done.”
Etienne rushed 19 times for 79 yards while Robinson, a sophomore who missed last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, had five yards on two carries. Quarterback Carson Beck completed 15 of 24 passes for 160 yards, including with his longest completion of 33 yards to Dominic Lovett with 2:45 left. That put the Bulldogs at midfield and provided breathing room in a game where nothing came easy.
Georgia’s defense overcame the absence of several players to ultimately make it harder for Kentucky. The Wildcats were held without a touchdown for the second consecutive game and became the ‘Dawgs’ fourth consecutive opponent unable to reach the end zone dating back to last season. The Bulldogs have yielded just 18 points through three games.
 Kentucky quarterback Brock Vandergriff, who transferred from Georgia after backing up Beck last season and Stetson Bennett during the Bulldogs’ two national title runs, completed 14 of 27 for 114 yards but was sacked three times. Two came consecutively in the second quarter, the second resulting in a strip fumble by Raylen Wilson and recovered by Damon Wilson II at the Kentucky 23 and setting up Woodring’s game-tying 34 yard field goal.
 Kentucky was the aggressor for the first 30-plus minutes, building a 6-3 halftime lead off Raynor’s first two field goals. The Wildcats also outgained the Bulldogs 130-63 by the break, nothing great, but a huge improvement from last week’s lackluster 183-yard outing. They were outgained 199-124 after halftime. 
“Give them credit. They made more plays than us,” Kentucky coach Mark Stoops said. “We played hard and thought we had opportunities to win the game.”
Georgia converted just 5 of 13 third-down chances and committed nine penalties for 85 yards. At the same time, the Bulldogs converted all three red-zone opportunities and didn’t allow a sack despite being frustrated by Kentucky’s defense.
“They’re a physical team and there’s a lot of respect there, but we were able to pull it out,” said Beck, who acknowledged a tough hit to his shoulder but said he’ll be fine. “A win is a win, and I’m really proud of the guys.”
Georgia: The Bulldogs were outgained in the first half and seemed out of synch for much of the night. But they limited Kentucky to field goals, and it was just a matter of time before they put something together to win a tough battle after two dominant performances.
Kentucky: This game wasn’t make or break, but the Wildcats had to move the needle after a dud performance against the Gamecocks. They were able to move the ball and even outgained the Bulldogs 284-262 but entered the red zone just once and didn’t reach the end zone for the second consecutive week. That wasn’t going to get it done against Georgia.
Georgia visits No. 4 Alabama on Sept. 28 in a rematch of last season’s SEC championship won by the Crimson Tide 27-24. 
Kentucky hosts Mid-American Conference member Ohio in its final non-league game before resuming SEC play.

NEW YORK (AP) — The questions wouldn’t stop for Jessica Pegula: Why was she 0-6 in Grand Slam quarterfinals heading into her U.S. Open matchup against No. 1 Iga Swiatek? What could Pegula do to change that? 
Came up during her on-court interview after winning in the previous round. And again at the news conference that followed. And again during a brief TV interview right before striding onto the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Wednesday night.
If that all weighed on Pegula, the 30-year-old American hid it well, pulling off a big upset by easily beating Swiatek 6-2, 6-4 at Flushing Meadows and earning a debut trip to the semifinals at a major.
“There have been so many freaking times, and I just kept losing,” said Pegula, who has won 14 of her past 15 matches, all on hard courts. “I know everyone keeps asking me about it, but I was like, ‘I don’t know what else to do. I just need to get there again and, like, win the match.’ So thank God I was able to do it. And finally — finally! — I can say, ‘Semifinalist.’”

She will face unseeded Karolina Muchova of the Czech Republic on Thursday for a berth in the final. 
Muchova, the runner-up to Swiatek at the 2023 French Open, made it to the final four in New York for the second consecutive year with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over No. 22 seed Beatriz Haddad Maia earlier Wednesday. Shortly after losing to Coco Gauff in last year’s semifinals, Muchova had surgery on her right wrist, then was off the tour for about 10 months until returning this June.


That was the latest in a series of injuries for Muchova, who called it “one of the worst ones that I had.”
“Doesn’t seem to matter how many matches she’s really gotten in; she seems to have good results no matter what. It’s cool to kind of see her back, because I think she’s really great for the game and the way she plays is really fun,” said the No. 6-seeded Pegula, who defeated Muchova at the Cincinnati Open last month. “She’s good, so talented, so skilled as a tennis player. Like, so complete. Doesn’t have a ton of weaknesses.”
The other women’s match Thursday night also will feature an American making her major semifinal debut, No. 13 Emma Navarro, against No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka, who won the past two Australian Open titles. Sabalenka lost to Gauff in the 2023 final in New York; Navarro ended Gauff’s title defense in the fourth round.

There are two Americans in the men’s semifinals, too, and they’ll face each other: No. 12 Taylor Fritz takes on No. 20 Frances Tiafoe on Friday.
This is the first time since the 2003 U.S. Open that multiple Americans reached both the women’s and the men’s semis.

The other men’s semifinal will be No. 1 Jannik Sinner against No. 25 Jack Draper. Sinner defeated 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 on Wednesday night to reach the final four at Flushing Meadows for the first time. Draper eliminated Alex de Minaur in straight sets.
The lopsided nature of Pegula’s win was surprising, but she did not think this day would never arrive.
“I knew I could do it,” she said. “I just had to go out and execute my game and not get frustrated.”
Swiatek served poorly in the first set and her forehand was a real problem, with 22 of her 41 unforced errors coming on that side. Pegula made only 22 unforced errors in all and used terrific defense to keep forcing Swiatek to hit an extra shot. 
“It’s never easy to play against Jess. She has a tricky ball because it’s pretty low and pretty flat,” Swiatek said. “I just made too many mistakes.”
Pegula also kept breaking serve against Swiatek, who counts the 2022 U.S. Open among her five Grand Slam titles and has led the WTA rankings for most of the past 2 1/2 years.
Entering Wednesday, Swiatek had lost just a pair of service games across four matches in the tournament, both in the first round — and she didn’t even face a single break point in any of her most recent three contests. That’s all part of why the 23-year-old from Poland was listed as a -350 money-line favorite against Pegula, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.
But Pegula, whose parents own the NFL’s Buffalo Bills and NHL’s Buffalo Sabres, didn’t have much trouble in that department, especially at the outset, breaking in each of Swiatek’s initial two service games, which both ended with double-faults, and three of the first six. 
It helped that Swiatek was unable to properly calibrate her first serves early, putting just 2 of 12 — 16.7% — in play at the start, only 36% for the opening set.
“I didn’t really understand why my serve wasn’t working,” Swiatek said.
Even as the games kept going in her favor, Pegula didn’t show much perceptible emotion, whether grabbing a 4-0 lead just 21 minutes in or taking up that set, which was greeted with a slight shake of her left fist as she walked to her sideline seat.
Swiatek didn’t hide her thoughts that well. She smacked her racket against the top of the net. She slapped her right thigh after a forehand flew wide to get broken yet again and trail 4-3 in the second set.
Fifteen minutes later, it was over. 
“I feel like when I have high expectations, I never perform well,” Swiatek said. “(But) it’s hard to have low expectations when everybody is expecting something from you.”

PARIS (AP) — Gisèle Pélicot, the woman who was allegedly drugged by her now ex-husband over the course of a decade so that she could be raped by dozens of men while unconscious, is becoming a symbol of France’s fight against sexual violence.
Some 700 people gathered at Place de la Republique in Paris in support for the 71-year-old and all rape victims in France. Some carried banners that hailed Pélicot for speaking out about her horrific ordeal and assured other victims of sexual violence that they are not alone. “Victims, we believe you. Rapists, we see you,” one banner said. 
Since the beginning of the extraordinary trial on Sept. 2, during which Pélicot will face 51 of her alleged rapists, she has been praised for her courage and composure.
First, there was her decision to keep the trial public — after the court had initially suggested that it be held behind closed doors. She allowed journalists to publish her full name, and the court to exhibit explicit videos recorded by her husband showing men engaging in sexual intercourses with her naked, inert body. 
She has said her decisions were in solidarity with other women who go unrecognized as victims of sexual crimes.
“It’s very important to be here because we need to talk about the rape culture,” said Anna Toumazoff, an activist and one of the organizers of the Paris protest. “After seven years of MeToo, we know that there is not a special type of victim. We are also collectively realizing that there is no special type of a rapist.” 


Despite several waves of the #Metoo reckoning in France, which featured several high profile women speaking publicly about the trauma they’ve endured after years of sexual abuse, protesters said that much of the violence remains unreported and often goes unpunished. 
On Sept. 5, Pélicot spoke about her ordeal in public for the first time since police officers, four years ago, called her in to tell her the unthinkable. With a calm and clear voice, she detailed the horror of discovering that her former spouse had been sedating her and invited at least 72 strangers into their house in Provence to have sex with her.
“For me, everything collapses,” she testified. “These are scenes of barbarity, of rape.”
National broadcaster TF1 that day described a “dignified, strong,” woman, who was “holding her head high.” 
In an open letter translated into English and published in French newspaper Le Monde, journalist and author Hélène Devynck thanked Pélicot for her bravery, echoing the feelings of many other French people.
“You entered our lives like you entered the Avignon court, through the front door,” wrote Devynck, a figure of the French #MeToo movement. “It’s not just you, Gisèle, that they’ve treated like a thing. They were telling us, all of us women, how insignificant we are. Your strength restores ours. Thank you for this immense gift.”
Next week, Gisèle Pélicot will have to brave another mountain: facing the man whom she shared her life for over 50 years, and father of their three children. Her lawyer has said she is planning on attending his testimony.
Her ex-husband, Dominique Pélicot, has previously confessed to the crimes to investigators. But his court hearing will be crucial for the panel of judges to decide on the fate of the 50 other men accused of rape.
A majority of the defendants are contesting the accusation of “rape”. Some have claimed they believed a husband’s consent for sexual intercourse was sufficient, others said they were tricked by Dominique Pélicot to believe his wife was consenting. 
One lawyer representing six defendants has shocked the nation arguing that “there is rape and rape, and without intention, there is no rape.” 
Magali Lafourcade, a magistrate and secretary general of the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights, also applauded Gisèle Pélicot. She stressed that in France, studies suggest that nine out of 10 women who are victims of rape do not press charges. And when they do, about 80% of the cases are dropped. 
For health reasons, Dominique Pélicot has been exempted from attending the trial since Wednesday. He is expected to testify on Monday or Tuesday, his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, has said. Asked whether her client was trying to get out of testifying, Zavarro said Friday that he “had been waiting for his trial, he wanted to talk and be confronted to his wife and children.”
Dominique Pélicot, now 71, and the 50 other defendants face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

WASHINGTON (AP) — While President Joe Biden was hosting a celebration of Black excellence at the White House with lawmakers, advocates and celebrities this past week, Kamala Harris was instead headed off to campaign in Pennsylvania. 
The nation’s first Black vice president spoke with voters there about supporting small businesses, building more housing and expanding the child tax credit. She said the country “needs a president of the United States who works for all the American people.”
What she did not do was spend time talking about her race or gender or the prospect that she would be the nation’s first Black and South Asian woman to be president if she defeated Republican Donald Trump.
As Harris courts voters, she embodies her identity as a woman of color rather than making it an overt part of her pitch, choosing instead to emphasize her policies and resume.
She’s making her case to minority voters in a number of key settings in the coming days. On Saturday at a Washington awards dinner sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, she told the crowd that as president she would work to build a strong middle class economy and protect freedoms including the right to vote and the right for a “woman to make decisions about her own body.” 
“We have some hard work ahead of us. But hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work,” she said. “Generations of people before us led the fight for freedom; now the baton is in our hands.” 


Biden, meanwhile, speaking to the crowd right before her, talked about Harris as the first Black and South Asian woman vice president, and said “God willing, she will become the first woman president of the United States of America.”
On Tuesday, she’ll sit with members of the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia. On Thursday, she’ll attend a livestream rally headlined by Oprah Winfrey and involving groups such as “Win with Black Women,” “White Women: Answer the Call,” and ”South Asians for Harris.” On Friday, she campaigns in Wisconsin. 
Throughout her career, Harris has been “many different firsts, and has never really led with that as a descriptor,” said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris’ winning campaign for California attorney general in 2010.
“Her life story and her identity and her background and her job experience have all been critical parts of her campaigns,” he said. But he added that “becoming the first — that has never actually been part of her core rationale for why she should be elected a office. It just happens to be a important result of her elections.”

Harris’ identity, too, is evident in how she chooses to engage with voters. A member of a historically Black sorority while attending Howard University, Harris spoke this summer in Houston at the annual assembly of another sorority, where she told the women “it is so good to be with you this evening, and I say that as a proud member of the Divine Nine. And when I look out at everyone here, I see family.”
It’s a different approach from Hillary Clinton’s in her 2016 Democratic campaign for president, when she put front and center her potential to break the glass ceiling. Harris’ aides and allies say with no time to lose in a compressed campaign this year, it is perhaps more valuable to focus on voters rather than herself.
North Carolina’s Crystal McLaughlin, who attended a Harris rally in Greensboro this past week, acknowledged Harris’ candidacy as an important “historical moment” but added that what is more important is to look at “who wants to do what’s right.”
What to know about the 2024 Election
Still, she said Harris’ identity matters even if it is not the focus on her campaign. 
“It’s important, not only for Black young girls, but for girls period,” said McLaughlin, 53, who is Black. “If you can see it, you can actually be it.”
So far, it’s been Trump who has brought up race in the campaign, falsely claiming that Harris belatedly “turned Black.” During the presidential debate this past week, he again said he had read she was “not Black” and then she was.
Harris did not mention herself once in her response, saying instead: “I think it’s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people.”
After Biden dropped out of the race in July, polling indicated that Black Americans were more excited about Harris as the Democratic nominee. In late July, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll showed that about 7 in 10 Black adults said would be satisfied with Harris as the Democratic nominee. That was a marked increase from earlier in July, when about half of Black adults and 15% of Hispanic adults felt that way about Biden.
Another AP-NORC poll conducted in August found that about half of Black adults said that “excited” would describe their feelings “extremely” or “very” well if Harris was elected president. Only about 3 in 10 had said the same about Biden in March.
Although Black Americans overwhelmingly identify as Democrats and about 9 in 10 Black voters supported Biden in the 2020 election, according to AP VoteCast, there are some signs that older Black voters may be more supportive of Harris than younger Black voters are. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that about 9 in 10 Black voters over age 50 were supporting Harris, compared with three-quarters of Black voters 18 to 49.
Civil rights organizations focused on mobilizing Black voters say they have seen an uptick in enthusiasm and engagement since Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket.
The NAACP has been circulating messaging with allied groups that its researchers believe will especially resonate with Black voters, including protecting the rights of Black Americans and appealing to their responsibility to vote.
On economic questions, the civil rights group is urging organizers and campaigns to listen to Black voters’ concerns.

“Black voters want policy solutions,” said Phaedra Jackson, vice president of unit advocacy and effectiveness at the NAACP. But she added: “Representation matters. Folks are excited to see a Black women vying for the highest office in the land” and they care more about institutions when they are represented within those institutions.
The NAACP has focused much of its voter turnout efforts in battleground states where they believe issues like voter suppression will be a potential issue come November.
At a packed fundraiser with a predominantly Black audience ahead of Saturday night’s black-tie gala, Harris gave a version of her standard campaign speech, placing added emphasis on the importance of fighting back against what she called a “full-on attack on the freedom to vote.” 
She also called out efforts to divide Americans, “create fear” and “pit the people of our country against each another.”
“This is what we’re up against,” she said.
At the Greensboro rally, John Spencer, a 58-year-old geographer from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said he wants Harris to stay focused on her plans for the future rather than her race and gender. Identity, unlike policies, is something you can tell just by looking at her, he said.
“Ideally in this country, a politician should be judged about their positions and not about anything other than who they are and their character and their positions,” said Spencer, who is white.
He said Harris’ positions matter more to him because he said they will ultimately impact his 11-year-old daughter Leah, who attended the Greensboro rally with him. 
When Harris takes a stage, said 66-year-old Sheila Carter, the Democratic presidential candidate’s identity is “self-explanatory.” Discussion about her race and gender are secondary to what she offers as a candidate, said Carter, a Black retiree from Durham, North Carolina, who attended the rally.
“You see who she is,” Carter said. “And as she says, ‘Why bother to even address whether or not I’m Black or Indian or whatever? I am who I am. You see it, I see it, the world sees it.‘”

Read the latest: Follow the AP’s live coverage of the escalating conflicts in the Middle East.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is sending a small number of additional troops to the Middle East in response to a sharp spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon that has raised the risk of a greater regional war, the Pentagon said Monday. 
Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not say how many more forces would be deployed or what they would be tasked to do. The U.S. now has about 40,000 troops in the region.
On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, two Navy destroyers and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Sixth Fleet area in Europe on a regularly scheduled deployment. The ships’ departure opens up the possibility that the U.S. could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Arabian Gulf, in the region in case more violence breaks out. 
“In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,” Ryder said. “But for operational security reasons, I’m not going to comment on or provide specifics.” 
AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports additional U.S. forces are being sent to the Middle East.
The new deployments come after significant strikes by Israeli forces against targets inside Lebanon that have killed hundreds and as Israel is preparing to conduct further operations. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday warned Lebanese civilians in a videotaped message to evacuate their homes ahead of a widening air campaign. He spoke as Israeli warplanes struck alleged Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon.


The U.S. has “concrete ideas” for restoring calm along the Israel-Lebanon border that it will present to allies and partners this week on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders, a senior State Department official said Monday.
The official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the private diplomatic efforts, said the U.S. and numerous other countries were eager to present an “off-ramp” for both Israel and Hezbollah to reduce tensions and prevent an all-out war.
The official would not detail what the “concrete ideas” are because he said they had yet to be presented to allies and partners for what he termed a “stress test” for their likelihood of success.
The State Department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war increases. 
“Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,” the State Department cautioned Saturday. 
Ryder would not say if the additional forces might support the evacuation of American citizens if needed. 
U.S. officials said a decision is expected soon, possibly this week, on whether the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier will stay in the Middle East or continue to the Asia-Pacific.
Having two carrier strike groups in the Middle East at the same time has been relatively rare in recent years. But as violence has spiked between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, both Iranian-backed militant groups, the Biden administration has ordered the Navy to have the carriers and their warships overlap for several weeks on a couple occasions.
It will take the Truman aircraft carrier about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean and get into the Mediterranean Sea. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements.
There is already a Marine amphibious ready group in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard, which is expected to be able to assist in an evacuation if needed.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held back-to-back calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over the weekend as he pressed for a cease-fire and a reduction of tensions in the region, Ryder said.
“Given the tensions, given the escalation, as I highlighted, there is the potential for a wider regional conflict. I don’t think we’re there yet, but it’s a dangerous situation,” Ryder said.
The American presence in the Middle East is designed both to help defend Israel and protect U.S. and allied personnel and assets. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Decades after she was picked to be America’s first teacher in space, Christa McAuliffe is still a pioneer — this time as the first woman to be memorialized on the grounds of New Hampshire’s Statehouse, in the city where she taught high school.
McAuliffe was 37 when she was killed, one of the seven crew members aboard the Challenger when the space shuttle broke apart on live TV on Jan. 28, 1986. She didn’t have the chance to give the lessons she had planned to teach from space. But people are still learning from her.
Benjamin Victor, the sculptor from Boise, Idaho, whose work was unveiled on Monday on what would have been McAuliffe’s 76th birthday, said McAuliffe’s “inspiration hasn’t been lost in the disaster and her memory will go on forever.”
Steven McAuliffe, her former husband, said Christa McAuliffe was proud to represent teachers and would be enthusiastic about being honored “as long as it was shared with all teachers and educators.”
“It is a great honor for Christa. And at the same time it is a great and deserving honor for teachers and educators across this country,” he said. “I hope teachers everywhere will come and see it. I hope they take pride in their noble work. I hope that students will come and see. And I hope that they will be inspired to pursue their dreams,” he said.
The 8-foot-tall (2.4-meter) bronze, depicting McAuliffe walking in stride in a NASA flight suit, is believed to be the first full statue of McAuliffe, known for her openness to experimental learning. Her motto was: “I touch the future, I teach.”


Gov. Chris Sununu’s executive order enabled the McAuliffe statue to join statues of leaders such as Daniel Webster, John Stark and President Franklin Pierce. He said Monday that he’s eager for schoolchildren who visit the Statehouse each year to see the statue honoring “our hero teacher” and reflect on all that’s possible.
McAuliffe was picked from among 11,000 candidates to be the first teacher and private citizen in space. Beyond a public memorial at the Statehouse plaza on Jan. 31, 1986, the Concord school district and the city, population 44,500, have observed the Challenger anniversary quietly through the years, partly to respect the privacy of her family. Christa and Steven McAuliffe’s son and daughter were very young at the time she died and was buried in a local cemetery. Steven McAuliffe, who was then a lawyer and now is a federal judge, wanted the children to grow up in the community normally.
But there are other memorials, dozens of schools and a library named for McAuliffe, as well as scholarships and a commemorative coin. A science museum in Concord is dedicated to her and to native son Alan Shepard, the first American in space. The auditorium is named for her at Concord High School, where she taught American history, law, economics and a self-designed course called “The American Woman.” Students rush past a painting of her in her astronaut uniform.
In 2017-2018, two educators-turned-astronauts at the International Space Station recorded some of the lessons that McAuliffe had planned to teach, on Newton’s laws of motion, liquids in microgravity, effervescence and chromatography. NASA then posted “Christa McAuliffe’s Lost Lessons” online, a resource for students everywhere.
Victor, the sculptor, comes from a family of educators, including his mother, with whom he’s shared a number of discussions about McAuliffe as he’s worked on the statue — including his recollection of watching the Challenger disaster on television as a second-grader in Bakersfield, California.
“My heart goes out to the family but there’s a silver lining in all of this and that’s what we’re here to celebrate today. And that is that her lesson is continually taught,” said Victor, who has sculpted four of the statues in the U.S. Capitol’s National Statuary Hall, the most of any living artist. 
The event on Monday also featured one of McAuliffe’s students, Kris Coronis Jacques, who’s now a teacher, along with a student essay winner, Nathaniel Dunlap, who said McAuliffe inspired him to “look out for all opportunities and take them,” a chorus from Concord High School that sang “see the light, be the light;” and James Scully, chair of the commission tasked with creating the memorial in just 18 months. 
Pam Melroy, NASA’s deputy administrator, told the crowd that McAuliffe’s death was not in vain and spurred advancements in spacecraft design, risk management and the safety of human space flight.
“The statue will stand as a symbol of the resilient human spirit that Christa embodies, reminding us of both the risks and rewards of space exploration. Christa’s impact on NASA transcends time. Her mission catalyzed change, leading to a safer, more inclusive and more educationally focused space program,” she said. 
This story corrects the spelling of Kris Coronis Jacques’ last name.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Joey Ortiz drove in three runs for Milwaukee and the New York Mets mustered just two hits as their playoff hopes sustained another blow with a 6-0 loss to the Brewers on Saturday night.
New York (87-72) lost its third straight and fell one game behind Atlanta (88-71) in the NL wild card race when the Braves beat Kansas City 2-1 on a ninth-inning, walk-off homer from former Met Travis d’Arnaud. 
The Mets did get some help later Saturday night when Arizona lost 5-0 to San Diego. The Braves, Mets and Diamondbacks (88-73) are competing for the NL’s final two wild-card playoff berths.
“It’s a really short runway, but we do have three games, and three games are opportunities for us,” Mets first baseman Pete Alonso said. “In order for us to get where we need to go, we need to capitalize on opportunities.”
Both the Mets and Braves have head-to-head tiebreaker advantages over the Diamondbacks. The Mets and Braves would play a Monday doubleheader in Atlanta if their postseason fates haven’t been settled.
“Not winning the past couple of days is putting us in a difficult situation here,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. “We’ve got to come back and we have to win a game tomorrow. That’s the bottom line. And then see where we’re at, at the end of the day tomorrow, and then go to Atlanta and see what we’ve got.”
Ortiz put the Brewers ahead 2-0 in the fourth by looping a full-count curveball from Jose Quintana (10-10) into left-center for a bases-loaded single.


Milwaukee broke open the game in the eighth inning by scoring four runs off Reed Garrett, the first runs he allowed since Aug. 18. The outburst included an RBI single by Willy Adames, a bases-loaded walk by Ortiz and a two-run single by Andruw Monasterio.
The NL Central champion Brewers improved to 12-1 in their last 13 meetings with the Mets, including 5-0 this season. The Brewers are 17 of 17 in stolen-base attempts against the Mets after swiping two more Saturday.
“We’ve had fight all season,” Ortiz said. “It doesn’t matter who’s on the other side of the field or the position they’re in. We’re worried about ourselves and that day.”
Quintana and four relievers combined to strike out 18 — their most in a nine-inning game since a 20 against Pittsburgh on Sept. 18, 2022. But New York was shut out for the first time since Aug. 23 and was held to two hits or fewer for just the fifth time this year.
It marked the third time the Brewers had struck out at least 18 times in a nine-inning game, and the first time they won while doing so.
Jose Iglesias singled in the first inning to extend his hitting streak to 19 games and Starling Marte hit a ground-rule double in the fifth. The only other time the Mets put a runner on base was when Iglesias drew a one-out walk in the ninth.
Quintana (10-10) entered with 22 2/3 consecutive shutout innings. He struck out nine while allowing two runs, five hits and two walks in 4 1/3 innings.
After Milwaukee’s Jared Koenig pitched a scoreless first inning as the opener, Tobias Myers (9-6) took over and struck out five while allowing one hit and no walks in four innings.
Joel Payamps, Aaron Ashby, Nick Mears and Devin Williams each pitched one inning of hitless relief.
“Sometimes days like these are going to happen,” Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo said. “It’s unfortunate that it’s happening right now, but all you can do is, you just pick it up, you go shoot your shots the next day and you hope that it turns around. You put in your preparation and then you send it.”
After the Brewers pulled ahead in the fourth, Marte led off the fifth with a double and advanced to third when Luis Torrens grounded out. Marte got stranded at third after Myers retired Harrison Bader on a liner to third and Luisangel Acuña on a fly to right.
Mets: C Francisco Alvarez was out of the lineup after back spasms caused him to leave the Mets’ 8-4 loss Friday. He struck out on a pinch-hitting attempt in the eighth inning. ... SS Francisco Lindor didn’t play the field and was 0 for 4 with two strikeouts as a DH, one day after returning from a sore lower back that had sidelined him for nearly two weeks.
Brewers: Although an MRI revealed no structural damage, OF Sal Frelick bruised his hip when he crashed into the right-field wall attempting to make a diving catch of a foul ball Friday. The Brewers expect to start the playoffs without Frelick but haven’t ruled out a possible return at some point in the postseason.
LHP David Peterson (9-3, 3.08) starts Sunday’s series finale for the Mets. RHP Colin Rea (12-5, 4.17) pitches for the Brewers.

DAMASCUS (AP) — A series of Israeli strikes hit multiple areas in central Syria late Sunday, killing at least four people, wounding 13 and sparking fires, state media reported.
Syria state news agency SANA reported that Syrian air defenses “confronted an aggression that targeted several points in the central region,” damaging a highway in Hama province and sparking fires that firefighting teams were battling to control early Monday.
At least four dead and 13 wounded people arrived at the Masyaf National Hospital in western Hamas province, SANA said, citing hospital head Faysal Haydar. It was not immediately clear if they were civilians or militants.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, reported that one of the strikes targeted a scientific research center in Maysaf and other sites where “Iranian militias and experts are stationed to develop weapons in Syria.” Local media also reported strikes around the coastal city of Tartous.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of war-torn Syria in recent years, but it rarely acknowledges or discusses the operations.
The strikes often target Syrian forces or Iranian-backed groups. Israel has vowed to stop Iranian entrenchment in Syria, particularly since Syria is a key route for Iran to send weapons to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
Hezbollah has been clashing with Israeli forces for the past 11 months against the backdrop of Israel’s war against Hamas — an ally of Hezbollah — in Gaza.",False

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched new strikes in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv that hit high-rise apartment buildings, leaving at least 21 wounded in a second consecutive nighttime attack, authorities said.
The bombs fell Saturday night on the district of Shevchenkivsky, north of the center of Kharkiv, which is the second-largest Ukrainian city, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Residential buildings sustained varying degrees of damage, including 16- and nine-story buildings, he added. Kharkiv’s city council said that 18 buildings were damaged. 
The wounded included an 8-year-old child, according to Syniehubov and Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Terekhov said that 60 residents were evacuated from one of the buildings, a high-rise that was hit directly.
Kharkiv has been a frequent target of Russian attacks since Moscow launched its all-out invasion of neighboring Ukraine in February 2022. On late Friday, 15 people, including children ages 10 and 12, were wounded when Russian airstrikes hit three Kharkiv neighborhoods, Terekhov said.
Ukrainian officials said that KAB-type aerial glide bombs — a retrofitted Soviet weapon that has for months laid waste to eastern Ukraine — were used in both attacks.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike and urged Kyiv’s Western allies to send more weapons to help it “protect lives and ensure safety.”
“Ukraine needs full long-range capabilities, and we are working to convince our partners of this,” Zelenskyy said on X, as he prepared to kick off a busy week in the United States shoring up support for Kyiv in the war.


And Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Sunday that Kyiv was in talks with partners in Europe to secure Swedish-made Gripen and European Eurofighter Typhoon jets. Umerov said that commitments were already in place for deliveries of U.S.-made F-16s and French Mirages. 
Russia also launched 80 Shahed drones and two missiles at Ukraine overnight into Sunday, the Ukrainian air force said. Ukrainian defenses shot down 71 drones, and another six were lost on location because of electronic warfare countermeasures, the statement said.
Farther south, a 12-year-old girl and a woman died after a Russian drone struck a passenger car in the city of Nikopol, local Gov. Serhii Lysak reported. Two others, including a 4-year-old child, suffered wounds. 
In the eastern Donetsk region, a Russian airstrike on Sunday morning struck homes in the city of Sloviansk, trapping a woman under rubble and wounding two of her neighbors, regional prosecutors reported. 
In the same province, two miners died and one other person was injured late Saturday after Russian forces shelled a mine west of the city of Pokrovsk, local Gov. Vadym Filashkin and Ukraine’s Energy Ministry reported.
Pokrovsk and Sloviansk have both been key targets for Russian forces as they continue their grinding push westwards aimed at capturing the entirety of Ukraine’s industrial east. 
In southern Ukraine, a Russian drone strike on Sunday morning wounded two civilians in the city of Kherson, regional authorities said. Hours later, police reported that Russian attacks wounded at least four more people elsewhere in the province. 
Other Russian drone attacks Sunday damaged energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s central Poltava region and the northern city of Shostka, officials reported. 
Shostka lies in the Sumy region, across the border from Russia’s Kursk province — the target of a startling Ukrainian military incursion launched last month. Weeks into the incursion, Zelenskyy said that the aim is to create a buffer zone to prevent further Russian cross-border strikes that have for months wreaked havoc in Sumy. 
Around 10,000 residents have left the nearby town of Hlukhiv because of intensified Russian shelling, around a third of its prewar population, the local military administration said Sunday. 
That includes almost 70% of the town’s children, following the regional government’s calls to evacuate parts of the Sumy region nearest the Russian border. Hlukhiv lies less than 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Russian territory, and about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Shostka. 
Also on Sunday, a firefighter was killed and two others were injured by a Ukrainian drone in the Russia-occupied Luhansk province in eastern Ukraine, the Russian Emergencies Ministry said.
In Russia proper, in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, Ukrainian shelling wounded at least 12 people including a village official and members of a volunteer self-defense force, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. 
Several Russian regions, including Belgorod in the south, set up so-called territorial defense units to counter-sabotage activity after Russian troops moved into Ukraine in February 2022.

Publication date:2024-09-28 23:52:00

Smoke rose from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday after the area was pummeled by heavy airstrikes that Israel said killed multiple Hezbollah commanders, including leader Hassan Nasrallah.
The Lebanese militant group confirmed the death of its longtime leader, whose killing could dramatically reshape conflicts across the Middle East.
Attacks on Hezbollah targets by fighter jets continued Saturday after the army said it told residents to evacuate three buildings it was targeting, as Israel braced for Hezbollah’s response.
Hours before the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah would continue — further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire. Netanyahu abruptly cut his United States visit short and returned to Israel. 
More than 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict escalated less than two weeks ago, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. 
The United Nations says the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon has more than doubled and now stands at more than 211,000. At least 20 primary healthcare centers have shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon, the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. 
Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues, raising fears of further displacement.


Here’s the latest:
Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani wrote a letter to the heads of the United Nations and the Security Council on Saturday calling for an emergency council meeting over the attack that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
“Using U.S.-supplied thousand-pound bunker busters,” he wrote, Israel killed Nasrallah and Iranian Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, among others.
He warned Israel not to attack any of its diplomatic premises or representatives. “Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent rights under international law to take every measure in defense of its vital national and security interests,” Iravani wrote.
Hezbollah confirmed Saturday that Nasrallah, its leader and one of its founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a southern suburb of Beirut.
UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s foreign minister said Saturday that lots of people think Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was aimed at provoking Iran and the U.S. “to unleash a full-blown war in the entire region.”
Sergey Lavrov told a news conference after addressing the annual global gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the killing is “not simply a political assassination. It’s very cynical as an act.”
Hezbollah confirmed Saturday that Nasrallah, its leader and one of its founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a southern suburb of Beirut.
“I think — well not even I think but a lot of people say — that Israel wants to create the grounds to drag the U.S. directly into this, and so to create these grounds is trying to provoke Iran,” Lavrov said.
“The Iran leadership, I think, are behaving extremely responsibly. And this is necessary. This is something that we should take due note of,” he said.
BAGHDAD — Hundreds of protesters tried to cross Saturday into the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, where the U.S. Embassy is based.
Supporters of Iran-allied Shiite factions gathered near the entrance to the zone at the suspension bridge over the Tigris River. They attempted to breach the Green Zone and storm the embassy in anger over the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs.
Iran-backed Iraqi militias have periodically launched drone attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in protest over Washington’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Iraqi authorities closed one of the fortified gates of the Green Zone to regular traffic, restricting access to holders of Green Zone ID badges.
A day earlier, the U.S. announced an agreement with the Iraqi government to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year. U.S. troops will depart some bases that they have occupied during a two-decade-long military presence in the country.
WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, twice on Friday about the situation in Lebanon, the Pentagon said Saturday.
Austin said Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian-backed groups, according to a statement from Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary.
“Secretary Austin stressed that the United States is determined to prevent Iran and Iranian-backed partners and proxies from exploiting the situation or expanding the conflict,” Ryder said.
The statement said Austin made it clear that the U.S. was prepared to protect American forces in the region and was committed to defending Israel.
TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that assassinating Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah became an “essential condition” for Israel to achieve its war goals.
In his first public remarks since the killing, Netanyahu said the killings of top Hezbollah commanders was not enough and he decided Nasrallah also needed to be killed.
He blamed Nasrallah for being “the architect” of a plan to “annihilate” Israel.
WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday called Hassan Nasrallah “a terrorist with American blood on his hands,” while urging a diplomatic solution to stem the escalating tensions in the Middle East.
The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to the militant group. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel ’s war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran.
“President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,” Harris said in a statement reacting to confirmation of Nasrallah’s killing in an Israeli airstrike. She added: “Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.”
The confirmation of Nasrallah’s death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech on Friday to the U.N., vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike killing Nasrallah.
WASHINGTON — The State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of U.S. diplomats who are not employed by the embassy in Beirut. It also authorized the departure of those who are, as well as nonessential employees because of “the volatile and unpredictable security situation” in Lebanon’s capital.
The move comes after an Israeli strike on Friday killed the leader of the Hezbollah militant group, intensifying the fighting along another front of war, this time between Israel and Hezbollah.
The State Department has previously advised American citizens to consider leaving Lebanon and reiterated its warning against all travel to the country.
“Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,” the department said in a statement Saturday.
The State Department routinely orders or authorizes the departure of nonessential embassy staffers and the families of diplomats when security conditions in the country where they are posted deteriorate.
An ordered departure is not technically an evacuation but does require those affected to leave. An authorized departure allows those affected to leave the country voluntarily at government expense. 
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday called the Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah a “measure of justice” for his four-decade reign of terror.
The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day.
Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023.
“Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,” Biden said in a statement.
He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans. 
TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s military says it killed a Hezbollah intelligence official Saturday in a strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed.
The Israeli Defense Forces said it “eliminated” Hassan Khalil Yassin in a strike in the Dahieh area of Beirut. The Israeli military said Yassin was involved in planning attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, including some planned to be carried out “in the coming days.”
UNITED NATIONS — The head of the United Nations is urging all sides to “step back from the brink” following the dramatic escalation of events in Beirut in the last 24 hours, his spokesman said.
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres believes “this cycle of violence must stop now,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Saturday. “The people of Lebanon, the people of Israel, as well as the wider region, cannot afford an all-out war.”
Guterres urged the combatant parties to recommit to the full implementation of the 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon “and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities,” Dujarric said.
TEL AVIV, Israel — Air raid sirens sounded across central Israel, including at the Tel Aviv international airport, shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed from a trip to the U.S.
The Israeli military said a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted shortly after the sirens were heard. There were no reports of injuries.
Later on Saturday, Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they targeted the airport during Netanyahu’s arrival with a ballistic missile.
Netanyahu cut short his trip to the U.S. to deal with the growing crisis in Israel’s battle against Hezbollah militants.
TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has offered condolences over the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and accused the United States of supporting his killing in Israeli airstrikes. 
“The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,” Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned what he called Israel’s “savage attacks” that have killed hundreds of Lebanese people.
In a post on X, Erdogan urged Muslim countries to “exhibit a more determined stance against these attacks.”
“With the United Nations Security Council first and foremost, we are calling to action all institutions working toward global peace, stability and security, as well as all human rights organizations,” he wrote.
The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen mourned Nasrallah’s death and said the killing won’t deter Hezbollah or other Iranian-backed groups fighting against “the Israeli enemy.”
The Houthis have launched drone and missile attacks on shipping routes and on Israel as part of their support for Palestinian militant groups.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran says a prominent general in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard died in an airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut.
The state-run IRNA news agency says Abbas Nilforushan, 58, was killed Friday in Lebanon.
Nilforushan was sanctioned in 2022 by the U.S. government, which identified him as deputy commander for operations in the guard. It said he had been a leader in suppressing protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.
Nilforushan also served in Syria, backing President Bashar Assad in the civil war that grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring.
In 2020, Iranian state television called him a “comrade” of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the expeditionary Quds Force, who was killed in a 2020 U.S. drone attack in Baghdad.
BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health minister says 1,030 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon in less than two weeks, more than in the previous 11 months.
Health Minister Firass Abiad says the toll includes 156 women and 87 children.
A total of 1,640 people in Lebanon have died since Hezbollah began firing rockets over the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, the day after Hamas’ deadly raid into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
The health ministry counted 11 people killed and 108 wounded on Friday, but said the true toll may be higher.
TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s military updated guidelines for residents on Saturday that prohibit large gatherings, demonstrations, and sports events in central Israel due to concerns of a counterattack after Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
School remains canceled in northern Israel for some 600,000 students.
Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel expects “challenging days ahead” as the country braces for a response. Hagari said at a media briefing that Nasrallah “posed a threat to Israeli citizens for decades, and his elimination makes the world a safer place.”
Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Friday’s strike in southern Beirut that killed Nasrallah was one of “the most important targeted strikes since the founding of the state of Israel.”
BAABDA, Lebanon — Shots rang out in Hezbollah’s stronghold of southern Beirut and other areas of Lebanon as people fired in the air to mourn the death of the only leader many Lebanese have known for the powerful militant group.
Angry supporters shouted, decrying his death. One woman holding her baby in the western city of Baabda, shouted: “Wish it was our kids, not you, Sayyid,” using an honorific title for Nasrallah.
The Gaza-based Palestinian militant group Hamas issued condolences to its ally, Hezbollah. It said Nasrallah’s death would not stop the two Iran-backed militant groups’ fight against Israel.
Hamas said in a statement that “assassinations will only increase the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine in determination and resolve.”
BEIRUT — Hezbollah has confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah and vowed to continue its “holy war” against Israel and “in support of Palestine.”
The group said in a statement that Nasrallah “has joined his fellow martyrs.”
Nasrallah led the militant group for more than three decades. His death could dramatically reshape conflicts across the Middle East.
TEL AVIV, Israel – Israel’s military says it is continuing to strike sites belonging to Hezbollah in Lebanon, some under residential buildings, after the massive attack that targeted the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah.
The Israeli army says it hit more than 140 targets since Friday night, including a storage site for anti-ship missiles beneath civilian apartment buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs.
Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck the weapons stores under six different buildings as, working to “degrade and dismantle” Hezbollah’s infrastructure and capabilities, the military said.
It is unclear how many people have been killed in the Israeli strikes on densely populated urban areas. 
The United Nations says fighting has displaced more than 200,000 Lebanese in the past week.
TEHRAN, Iran — Iranian state television says a flight from Tehran bound for Lebanon was turned away from Beirut airport on Saturday.
It reported that the decision came following a warning by Israel that the airport could be targeted if the passenger plane landed.
Israel’s military says it will not allow the civilian airport to be used for military purposes and that pilots are patrolling the skies over the airport for weapons smuggling.
Sky News reported that Lebanon’s transport minister intervened to stop the plane from landing.
TEHRAN, Iran – Iran’s supreme leader has urged all Muslims to stand by Hezbollah against Israel, but has not indicated how Tehran will respond to the reported killing of the group‘s leader Hassan Nasrallah.
Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli militant groups in the region.
In his first comments since Israel claimed to have killed Nasrallah, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, “it is the duty of all Muslims to stand by the people of Lebanon and Hezbollah” against the “occupier, evil and suppressor” regime of Israel.
In a statement read on state TV, he said “all regional resistance forces” support and stand beside Hezbollah.
Iran’s influential parliamentary committee on national security met Saturday and demanded a “strong” response to Israel, state TV reported.
In April, for the first time, Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones toward Israel following an Israeli strike that killed Iranian military advisors.
JERUSALEM — Israel’s military says it expects Hezbollah to retaliate for the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah and is on “high readiness.”
Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said much of Hezbollah’s arsenal remains intact despite intense Israeli strikes over the past week, and that Israel will continue to target the group.
“This isn’t a threat that has gone away,” he said. Shoshani said it is “safe to assume” that Hezbollah will retaliate.
But he said Israel hopes the blow “will change Hezbollah’s actions” and alter the course of the war.
Shoshani said the airstrike targeting Nasrallah was based on years of tracking him, along with “real-time information.” He said Israel confirmed the death through various types of intelligence, though he declined to elaborate.
COLOGNE, Germany — The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that airlines not operate in Lebanese or Israeli airspace.
The Cologne, Germany-based EASA said Saturday that “an overall intensification of air strikes and degradation in the security situation has been noted, impacting the safety of airspace over Israel and Lebanon.”
It did not cite any one specific event in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as a trigger for issuing its “conflict zone information bulletins” for the two countries.
It said the recommendation is valid until Oct. 31 but could be reviewed earlier and adapted or withdrawn.
TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Saturday that it killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah militant group, in a strike in Beirut on Friday.
The military said that it carried out a precise airstrike while Hezbollah leadership met at their headquarters in Dahiyeh, south of Beirut.
Ali Karki, the Commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front, and additional Hezbollah commanders, were also killed in the attack, the Israeli military said. The Lebanese Health Ministry said that 6 people were killed and 91 injured in the strikes on Friday, which leveled six apartment buildings.
Nasrallah has led Hezbollah for more than three decades. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah.
Israel maintained a heavy barrage of airstrikes against Hezbollah on Saturday, as Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets toward Israel. 
TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said it was mobilizing additional reserve soldiers as tensions escalate with Lebanon. The military said Saturday morning it was activating three battalions of reserve soldiers, after earlier sending two brigades to northern Israel earlier in the week to train for a possible ground invasion.
CAIRO — An Israeli airstrike killed at least two people and wounded 11 others in the central Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza, the Awda hospital said.
The strike hit a house late Friday in the camp, according to the hospital which received the casualties in the first hours of Saturday.
More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the nearly year-long war. 
TEL AVIV, Israel — Hezbollah launched more than two dozen projectiles toward Israel Saturday morning, triggering sirens in more than 100 cities and towns across Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
The Israeli military said a surface-to-surface missile was fired from Lebanese territory and fell in an open area in central Israel. Israeli media said the missile fell in the sea. 
No injuries or damages were reported, according to Israel’s Fire and Rescue Services.
While Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since Oct. 8 mostly in the area around the border, in the past weeks, the strikes have targeted much deeper into both countries. 
BEIRUT — Patients in hospitals in Beirut’s southern suburbs will be evacuated to medical centers in the capital and the nearby Mount Lebanon region, Lebanon’s Health Ministry says.
In a statement carried by state news agency early Saturday, the ministry called on hospitals in Beirut and Mount Lebanon to stop receiving cases that can be delayed in order to receive patients evacuating from the hard-hit southern suburb Dahiyeh.
BEIRUT — Smoke rose from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday morning and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes.
Explosions rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs, with flames lighting up the pre-dawn darkness. Fire raged from at least one location, and smoke and flames were seen from above Beirut early Saturday. Residents reported jets flying overhead. 
In a short statement, the Israeli military described the sites it hit as belonging to Hezbollah. Authorities there did not immediately acknowledge if there were any casualties.
Shelters set up in the city center for people displaced by the onslaught were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and beaches, or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen making an exodus on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry.",False

PARIS (AP) — Marseille overcame an early sending off and rallied from a goal down to win 3-2 at Lyon amid a chaotic finale on Sunday, a result which moved it level on points at the top of the French league with leader Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco.
Lyon midfielder Rayan Cherki equalized in the third minute of stoppage time, only for summer signing Jonathan Rowe to win the game for Marseille two minutes later.
The top three are on 13 points and unbeaten after five games, with PSG ahead of Marseille and third-place Monaco on goal difference.
No visiting Marseille fans were allowed at Lyon because of the risk of soccer violence after fan clashes between rival groups in recent years.
Marseille’s hopes were dented when defender Leonardo Balerdi was sent off in the fifth minute for a second yellow card. His first came after just 24 seconds when he went in late on midfielder Corentin Tolisso and the second was for a clumsy challenge on striker Alexandre Lacazette.
Marseille goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli saved Lacazette’s penalty in first-half stoppage time but was beaten in the 53rd when center back Duje Caleta-Car headed home and perhaps forgot the unwritten “rule” about not celebrating against your former club. 
Pol Lirola equalized in the 69th from winger Luis Henrique’s pass. Lirola then turned provider in the 82nd with a right-wing cross for fellow defender Ulisses Garcia, who adroitly guided the ball over goalkeeper Lucas Perri’s head from the left of the penalty area. 


The drama was not over as Cherki expertly backheeled a cross in from a tight angle, only for the English forward Rowe to pounce with virtually the last kick of the game.
Perri botched his clearance and Rowe gathered the ball about 35 meters out on the left, beat two players and curled the ball in to trigger jubilation from Marseille’s players and their new coach Roberto De Zerbi.
Earlier, United States forward Folarin Balogun was among the scorers as Monaco followed up its Champions League win against Barcelona with a 3-1 victory over Le Havre.
Monaco won 2-1 against Barcelona on Thursday.
Fans at Stade Louis II enjoyed an early goal when right back Jordan Teze headed in Takumi Minamino’s cross. Daler Kuzyayev equalized in the 30th minute. 
Eliesse Ben Seghir broke Le Havre’s resistance in the 66th with a fine finish, curling the ball into the top right corner. Balogun netted four minutes later after being set up by 18-year-old forward George Ilenikhena, who scored Monaco’s winner against Barca.
In Sunday’s other matches, it was last-place Angers 1, Nantes 1; Brest 2, Toulouse 0; and Montpellier 3, Auxerre 2.
Brest fans were in high spirits after enjoying their first ever European game on Thursday. This time they celebrated goals in Brittany from forward Mama Baldé and midfielder Romain Faivre.
Nigerian striker Akor Adams netted twice for Montpellier.
PSG dropped its first points of the season when it was held 1-1 at Reims on Saturday.

                Question: Who won the NASCAR playoff opener at Atlanta Motor Speedway on September 8, 2024?

Publication date:2024-09-08 07:00:00

HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) — One of the first things Joey Logano said after winning NASCAR’s playoff opener was that the postseason is his time of the year. 
And, in 10 initial playoff appearances, he typically slid his way through the rounds, winning two Cup titles and never finishing lower than eighth in the standings. 
Then came last year when Logano, as the reigning Cup champion, was eliminated from the 16-driver field in the very first round for the first time in his career. He dreaded going to the track for the remainder of the season even as Team Penske teammate Ryan Blaney went on to win the championship. 
There will be no stumble this year, not after an overtime victory Sunday at Atlanta Motor Speedway gave Logano an automatic berth into the second round of the playoffs. 
“That’s how we start the playoffs, boys!” Logano shouted. “When it is playoff time, it is our time.”
Logano won the 11th race of the season to end in overtime — a tie for the record set in the 2017 season. He’s trying to become the only active three-time Cup champion in the series. Kyle Busch, who did not make the playoffs, is the only other driver with two Cup titles. 
“We’ve been able to level up when we need to level up and be able to fire off the first race of the playoffs and with a statement is key, right?” Logano said. 
Ryan Blaney was initially listed in second for a 1-2 sweep for Team Penske and Ford. Blaney lined up behind Logano and gave him the pushes he needed to deny Daniel Suarez the victory. 


But after a review, Suarez was moved to second and Blaney dropped to third. Team owner Roger Penske was not at the race because the Detroit resident was scheduled to attend the Lions’ NFL home opener later Sunday.
Suarez, who won the closest three-wide finish in NASCAR history here in February, had his own help from Trackhouse Racing teammate Ross Chastain. The two-lap overtime sprint to the finish began with Logano and Suarez lined up side-by-side on the front row, each with their teammate behind them for the push to the front. 
Blaney got Logano out first, but Chastain remained locked onto the bumper of Suarez’s Chevrolet and the two dueled it out until Blaney used a final push to get his Penske teammate the win. 
Suarez, who gained two spots in the standings to ninth with his runner-up finish, was disappointed to come up short. 
“No, definitely not satisfied. I am happy with it, but not satisfied,” he said. “I felt like we were going to have a great shot at it. Ross was doing an amazing job of pushing, and I don’t know if he got a flat tire or something, but once I lost him, I knew it was going to be tough. But, that is part of racing, right?”
Christopher Bell in a Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing finished fourth, and Alex Bowman in a Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports was fifth. Regular-season champion Tyler Reddick of 23XI Racing was sixth and followed by Busch of Richard Childress Racing, Chase Elliott of Hendrick, William Byron of Hendrick and Austin Cindric of Penske. Only two Toyotas — Bell and Reddick — finished inside the top 10. 
Larson running third in the closing laps of the first stage when his car inexplicably shot into the outside wall. 
“I don’t know if I blew a tire or what,” Larson radioed. 
As the No. 5 Chevrolet shot back down the track, Larson was hit in the rear by fellow playoff driver Chase Briscoe. That contact caused damage to Briscoe’s Ford. 
The incident ended the race for both drivers. 
Larson was the points leader at the start of Sunday before his crash, which he called one of the hardest hits of his career and it came without any warning. 
“No, not at all. Never. Not once,” Larson said. “It just caught me way off guard. I was never once loose, even in that corner. And then, it just started stepping out. I corrected it and overcorrected it, I guess. I feel fine. Thankfully, everything held up great in the car.”
His 37th-place finish dropped him all the way to 10th in the standings; four drivers will be cut from the field after the Sept. 21 race at Bristol Motor Speedway. 
Briscoe, who won last week’s regular-season finale to make the playoff field, was ranked 13th out of 16 at the start of the race. He’s now last in the standings after finishing last in the race.
“That’s NASCAR — you can be on top one week and you can be at the very bottom of the mountain the next week,” said Briscoe, who added he was fortunate not to be injured. “It was a big hit. One of the biggest hits I’ve had in a long time. My private area hurt pretty bad at first, just when I hit it was a big hit, but, other than that, I’m totally good. 
“My head, everything feels fine. I’m glad my ankles didn’t get messed up. The brake pedal and everything went through the floorboard, so I’m thankful that I’m alright, for sure.”
It was a huge points day for Bowman, who opened the week defending his job in the No. 48 for Hendrick Motorsports. His performance has been off since an injury last season and Bowman needed a win at Chicago to earn a spot in the playoff field. 
He began the playoffs ranked 12th and jumped all the way to sixth by finishing fifth at Atlanta. 
It was the exact opposite for Denny Hamlin, who opened the day ranked sixth but had a horrible weekend in Atlanta that ended with a last-lap crash and a 23rd-place finish. He dropped to 11th in the standings and is only three points above the cutoff line. 
Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Ty Gibbs, who led 37 laps, faded to 17th and is the final driver above the cutline with a one-point margin. 
The four drivers below the cutline and in danger of elimination are Brad Keselowski, Harrison Burton, Martin Truex Jr., and Briscoe.
The road course in Watkins Glen, New York, makes its debut in the 10-race playoff schedule next Sunday. Hendrick Motorsports drivers Chase Elliott, Larson and William Byron have combined to win the last five races at the track dating to 2018 when Watkins Glen was part of the regular-season schedule.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Billie Jean King is now the first individual female athlete to be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. 
President Joe Biden signed bipartisan legislation Thursday to recognize King for “a remarkable life devoted to championing equal rights for all, in sports and in society.”
The bill to honor King, the tennis Hall of Famer and activist, passed unanimously in the Senate and then in the House of Representatives.
The bill was introduced last September on the 50th anniversary of King’s victory over Bobby Riggs in the “Battle of the Sexes,” still the most-watched tennis match of all-time. The medal, awarded by Congress for distinguished achievements and contributions to society, has previously been given to athletes including baseball players Jackie Robinson and Roberto Clemente, and golfers Jack Nicklaus, Byron Nelson and Arnold Palmer.
King had already been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., a co-introducer of the bill, said she has “broken barriers, led uncharted paths, and inspired countless people to stand proudly with courage and conviction in the fight for what is right.”

PHOENIX (AP) — Willy Adames hit a grand slam as part of a two-homer night, Garrett Mitchell added a two-run homer and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 15-8 on Saturday.
Milwaukee’s magic number to win the NL Central is down to 3. The Brewers will go for the three-game sweep Sunday.
Adames has 32 homers this season, which breaks his previous career high of 31 in 2022.
“It’s been amazing,” Adames said. “It’s been a special year for me and the team.”
Arizona (82-66) still has sole possession of the second NL wild-card spot, but is just one game ahead of the Atlanta Braves (81-67) and the New York Mets (81-67) with 14 games to play.
“We’ve got to be better on the mound,” D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said. “Tonight was a total lack of pitch execution, missed pitches in the middle of the zone, lack of command with our secondary stuff.”
Milwaukee’s Tobias Myers (8-5) gave up four runs on nine hits over six innings. He struck out three.
The Brewers took a 1-0 lead in the first on William Contreras’ sacrifice fly that score Brice Turang, who reached on a leadoff walk. They kept their advantage when Sal Frelick robbed Corbin Carroll of a solo homer, leaping to reach over the fence and make the catch.
Milwaukee scored seven runs in the second inning, all with two outs.
D-backs right-hander Brandon Pfaadt (9-9) retired the first two batters of the second before the next seven batters reached base. Turang and Jackson Chourio hit back-to-back RBI singles, Contreras walked to load the bases, Mitchell walked to force in a run and then Adames launched a sweeper into the left field seats for an 8-0 lead.


“You go to the body, you go to the body, you go to the body and — boom — it opens up a shot to the head,” Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. “It’s all part of pecking away and being relentless. We did it from the first hitter of the game.”
The homer ended Pfaadt’s outing after 1 2/3 innings. He gave up seven hits and walked three. The 25-year-old has struggled over his past four outings, giving up 28 runs, including 24 earned, over 15 2/3 innings.
The Brewers had a 13-0 lead in the sixth inning.
“We know how important these games are and to let the team down with a game like that is unacceptable,” Pfaadt said. “We’ve got to do better.”
Adames had five RBIs, pushing his NL leading total to 107. Mitchell reached base five times, including three walks. Contreras hit a two-run homer in the ninth to make it 15-8.
Arizona’s Randal Grichuk hit a two-run homer and had three RBIs. Geraldo Perdomo had a two-run double and Josh Bell added a two-run single.
Diamondbacks: RHP Ryne Nelson (right shoulder inflammation) was put on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to Sept. 11. LHP Brandon Hughes was called up to take his roster spot.
The D-backs send RHP Zac Gallen (12-6, 3.55 ERA) to the mound Sunday against LHP DL Hall (1-1, 4.01 ERA)

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia Sunday, officials said, sparking a wildfire and setting an apartment block alight in one of the largest barrages seen over Russian skies since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Russia’s Ministry of Defense reported that it had shot down 125 drones overnight across seven regions. The southwestern region of Volgograd came under particularly heavy fire, with 67 Ukrainian drones reportedly downed by Russian air defenses.
Seventeen drones were also seen over Russia’s Voronezh region, where falling debris damaged an apartment block and a private home, said Gov. Aleksandr Gusev. Images on social media showed flames rising from the windows of the top floor of a high-rise building. No casualties were reported.
A further 18 drones were reported over Russia’s Rostov region, where falling debris sparked a wildfire, said Gov. Vasily Golubev.
He said that the fire did not pose a threat to populated areas, but that emergency services were fighting to extinguish the blaze, which had engulfed 20 hectares (49.4 acres) of forest.
Elsewhere, 16 civilians were injured in an overnight barrage on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia after Ukrainian military leaders warned that Moscow could be preparing for a new military offensive in the country’s south.
The city was targeted by Russian guide bombs in 10 separate attacks that damaged a high-rise building and several residential homes, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov wrote on his official Telegram channel. More people could still be trapped beneath the rubble, he said.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said that the Zaporizhzhia attack had damaged the city’s transport links. “Today, Russia struck Zaporizhzhia with aerial bombs. Ordinary residential buildings were damaged and the entrance of one building was destroyed. The city’s infrastructure and railway were also damaged,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X.
The Ukrainian leader appeared Sunday at a memorial service to make the 83rd anniversary of the Babyn Yar massacre, one of the most infamous mass slaughters of World War II.
Babyn Yar, a ravine in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, is where nearly 34,000 Jews were killed within 48 hours in 1941 when the city was under Nazi occupation.
“Babyn Yar is vivid proof of the atrocities that regimes are capable of when led by leaders who rely on intimidation and violence. At any time, they are no different,” Zelenskyy said in a statement. “But the world’s response should be different. This is the lesson the world should have learned. We must guard humanity, life, and justice.”
The Ukrainian military warned Saturday that Russian forces may be preparing for offensive operations in the wider Zaporizhzhia region. Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, said that Russia was amassing personnel in this direction.
Ukraine’s air force also reported that 22 Russian drones were launched over the country overnight. It said that 15 were shot down in Ukraine’s Sumy, Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv, and Odesa regions, and that five more were destroyed using electronic defenses. The fate of the remaining two drones was not specified. ___

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Chicago White Sox had a 2-1 lead going into the bottom of the eighth inning on Sunday, and then history struck.
That tenuous lead disappeared in the span of four San Diego Padres batters and the White Sox went on to their 120th loss, tying the post-1900 record set by the 1962 expansion New York Mets.
The dichotomy couldn’t have been greater. 
The White Sox headed to a somber clubhouse and quietly packed for their flight home. 
The Padres, who are closing in on a postseason berth, gathered in front of their dugout to applaud the sellout crowd of 45,197 that roared through the bottom of the eighth and then the top of the ninth of the 4-2 win in the regular-season home finale on the brilliant first day of autumn. Some fans even chanted “Beat L.A.!” in anticipation of a huge series starting Tuesday night at the Los Angeles Dodgers.
“I guess when you lose 120 it’s easier to brush it off but it (stinks) to go through it, but that’s where we’re at,” veteran Andrew Benintendi said. 
There had been hope for the White Sox to at least delay the historic loss, until there wasn’t. Right-hander Sean Burke, making just his second big league start — and third appearance — was outstanding through six innings. The White Sox took their lead on two home runs off Yu Darvish, including one by Korey Lee, who grew up in northern San Diego County.
“Burke threw a hell of a game,” Benintendi said. “They’ve got a lot of good bats up and down that lineup, guys that have played a long time and once they get the lead with that bullpen, it seems like its pretty much over at this point.


“So yes, it (stinks).”
So many of their losses have come late in games.
“Yeah we joke about it all the time. It never seems like we get blown out and the seventh, eighth, and ninth come around and we’re facing their seven-eight-nine-inning guys every night, which is big. It’s hard to score runs off the back ends of the bullpen,” Benintendi said.
“It seems like we have been here a lot of times and it just hasn’t panned out.”
With one more loss in their final six games, the White Sox will hold the modern-day record outright. They finish with three at home against the Los Angeles Angels beginning Tuesday night and finish with three at Detroit, which is in the AL wild-card hunt.
The 1899 Cleveland Spiders hold the major league record for losses at 20-134.
Interim manager Grady Sizemore didn’t address the team afterward.
“No loss is good,” he said. “It’s not something that we’re focused on. I think everyone outside this clubhouse is more obsessed with it than us. The way we spin is to put this one behind us and get ready for the series back home.”
Asked how his players were digesting it, Sizemore said: “We all know the situation. We know where we are at. We have a job to do and they are still playing for something. They have handled it like professionals and we will be back out there on Tuesday ready to go and give it our best.”
Said Lee: “I think if you ask all 50 guys or so (who have been on the roster this season) we are not going to be happy about it. If you’re happy about it, I don’t know what you are doing here.
“I think it’s obviously hard but at the same time everyone is coming in here every day and giving their best.”
The catcher said the team has stayed together through all the losing.
“It shows you how close we are. We talked about it earlier today. Honestly, that is what I look forward to every day when I come in here is having the guy right next to me and knowing he is going to care for me, inside and out, on the field and off the field.
“That is all you can ask for. It’s good family around us. Obviously there is a lot of bad but you have to take the good out of every day. And the good is coming in here with this group of guys and doing the thing we all love to do.”
The White Sox had tied the AL record of 119 losses by the 2003 Detroit Tigers on Saturday night. They had already lost their 20th straight road series and were swept for the 24th time this season.

NEW YORK (AP) — Alex Verdugo hit a go-ahead, two-run single with the bases loaded and two outs in the eighth inning and the New York Yankees ended the regular season with a 6-4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday.
Struggling for most of the second half, Verdugo snapped a 4-all tie by hitting a fastball from Carmen Mlodzinski into right field to score Austin Wells and Jasson Domínguez. Wells was hit by a pitch from Colin Holderman (3-6), and Domínguez walked.
Following a walk by Jon Berti, Verdugo delivered his fourth hit in 24 at-bats with the bases loaded. Acquired from Boston in December, Verdugo batted .233 in his first season with the Yankees.
“So many times it’s not the fancy, the sexy, big hits all the time,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “It’s the grinding out at-bats, working a walk, setting the table. Three really good ones there.”
It was Verdugo’s second hit this season and 12th of his career to give his team a lead in the eighth inning or later.
Luke Weaver (7-3) stranded a runner in the eighth and Clay Holmes struck out Oneil Cruz on a sweeper for his 30th save in 43 chances. It was Holmes’ first save since Aug. 30 against St. Louis.
AL East champion New York (94-68) clinched home-field advantage throughout the American League playoffs Saturday when Cleveland lost to Houston.
“I think we’re in a good spot,” Verdugo said.
Pittsburgh (76-86) matched its record from last year and finished its sixth straight losing season. The Pirates were 56-54 on Aug. 3 and lost 32 of their final 52 games.


“We have to get better,” manager Derek Shelton said. “The last two teams that we played in terms of the Brewers and the Yankees, they’re doing what we expect to do, and what we need to do and want to do.”
Trent Grisham hit a two-run homer two pitches in and had an RBI single after being a late addition to the Yankees’ lineup. Aaron Judge was scratched shortly before a 91-minute rain delay at the start.
Pitching in the rain, Clarke Schmidt allowed four runs and four hits in four-plus innings in an audition for New York’s postseason rotation — a day after rookie Luis Gil gave up four homers in similar conditions. Boone said neither of those outings will influence who is in the postseason rotation.
“We’re just ultimately trying to make the best decision who we think gives us the best chance in a given situation, in a given start against a given opponent, whatever it may be,” Boone said. “Again I feel like it’s a good decision we have in front of us because both guys are very capable.”
Schmidt finished with a 2.85 ERA in 16 starts and made five after missing more than three months with a right lat strain.
“Just really tough out there,” Schmidt said. “At times, you couldn’t really find the mound, the rubber from all the dirt that was covering the mound. It was hard to grip the ball because the rosins were so wet.”

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Welcome to the SEC, Texas. 
Arch Manning passed for two touchdowns and ran for another score, and No. 1 Texas got another standout performance from its defense to earn the program’s first Southeastern Conference victory, 35-13 over Mississippi State on Saturday. 
Manning was 26-of-31 passing for 324 yards in his second consecutive start in place of Quinn Ewers, who is still recovering from a strained abdomen. 
Texas joined the SEC this season from the Big 12 and delivered a rugged, ragged and ultimately effective debut that saw the Longhorns pull away late.
“I’m glad we had adversity today. The first four games were smooth sailing. We needed rough waters,” Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said. “Our guys showed composure. They found a way to fight back and pull away in a tough game and that’s what the SEC is all about.” 
Manning continues to impress. He delivered yet another performance that most teams would love to get from their starter.
″What a luxury to have a player of his caliber as our backup quarterback,” Sarkisian said. “(Ewers) is our quarterback and he’s our leader ...What we’ve learned, and what Arch has earned, is that this team can count on him, too.”
Manning’s 49-yard touchdown pass to Deondre Moore in the second quarter, and his 1-yard TD run in the third, opened up a tighter-than-expected matchup with the Bulldogs, who have lost four in a row. 


Manning set up his own touchdown with a 26-yard scramble near the goal line, and the touchdown made it 21-6 on the final play of the third quarter. Another scoring strike to Moore early in the fourth essentially put the game away for the Longhorns (5-0, 1-0). 
Yet Manning seems to know that Ewers is back at No. 1 when he’s healthy enough to return.
“Quinn has proven himself. This is his team,” Manning said. “I think he’ll come back and play really well.” 
Texas raced to an opening touchdown in five plays. But the Longhorns soon bogged down with a turnover, a dropped touchdown pass and a partially blocked punt.
Mississippi State (1-4, 0-2) had outgained Texas in total yards and pulled within 7-6 late in the first half on two field goals from Kyle Ferrie, until Manning stood in against a blitz and delivered a perfect strike to Moore just before he was hit. 
“We needed a big play and he hung that ball up,” Moore said. “We saw the play on the sideline. He got railed on that play.” 
The Longhorns defense did not allow a touchdown until Mississippi State quarterback Michael Van Buren’s 12-yard run with just under 7 minutes left. That score snapped a streak of nine consecutive quarters without giving up a touchdown. 
Van Buren started in place of Blake Shapen, who was lost for the season a week ago with a shoulder injury. He finished with 144 yards passing and the TD run. 
“I thought we won at the line of scrimmage both sides of the football early in the game. We needed to finish drives and score touchdowns,” Mississippi State coach Jeff Lebby said.
Mississippi State: A run-first game plan with Van Buren did what it could to keep the potent Texas offense off the field. It was working until Manning’s late TD strike in the second quarter. Van Buren seemed to handle himself well in his first career start on the road against the No. 1 team in front of about 101,000 opposing fans.
“Really tough,” Lebby said of Van Buren. “Proud of his effort.” 
Texas: The Longhorns struggled to run for three quarters against one of the nation’s worst rush defenses, and they were messy with nine penalties for 75 yards. Starting tailback Jaydon Blue killed two Texas drives with fumbles. There’s plenty to clean up before the next two games against No. 21 Oklahoma and No. 2 Georgia that will play a huge factor in whether the Longhorns contend for the SEC championship.
Manning’s grandfather Archie Manning and his uncle Eli Manning were two of the greatest quarterbacks in Mississippi history. It probably won’t be lost on the family that Arch guided Texas’ first SEC victory against their old archrival, Mississippi State. 
Texas leapfrogged Georgia to No. 1 two weeks ago when the Bulldogs won a scrappy game over Kentucky. The Longhorns were as sloppy and uneven as they’ve been all season and it took them a long time to put away the game. Yet a 22-point SEC win should be good enough to keep them on top another week. 
Mississippi State is off next week before playing at No. 2 Georgia on Oct. 12.
Texas is off next week before facing No. 21 Oklahoma in Dallas on Oct. 12.

Christian Pulisic kept up his scoring form as AC Milan netted three goals in five minutes shortly before halftime in a 3-0 win over Lecce in the Italian league on Friday
Álvaro Morata put the home side ahead with a glancing header from Theo Hernandez’s free kick after 38 minutes. Hernandez then ran on to a pass from Rafael Leão and lashed the ball into the roof of the net from a tight angle two minutes later before Pulisic made it 3-0 just before halftime.
It was the American’s fifth goal in seven games this season and takes his combined total of goals and assists since joining the Rossoneri in June last year to 32, higher than anyone else in the Serie A.
Davide Bartesaghi was shown a straight red card for Milan with 10 minutes remaining but it was too late to give Lecce hopes of a comeback.
The victory takes Milan to 11 points and joint top of the league with Torino, although the Turin club has a game in hand against Lazio on Sunday.
Lecce remains fourth from bottom of the 20-team league, with just one win and five points from its first six games.

MESA, Ariz. (AP) — U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced Wednesday that the Apache trout — Arizona’s state fish — has been removed from the federal list of endangered and threatened species following more than five decades of recovery efforts. 
Haaland traveled to Arizona for the announcement, which is considered an important conservation success marking the first sportfish and the first trout to be removed from the list. 
“This recovery is a testament to the importance of the Endangered Species Act and its tools and resources that are allowing the Interior Department and the federal government to protect vital species in every corner of America,” said Haaland. 
She credited joint efforts by federal, state and tribal officials along with $5.1 million from the Biden administration’s Investing in America program. Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, White Mountain Apache Tribe Chairman Kasey Velasquez, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Deputy Director Siva Sundaresan joined Haaland.
The Apache trout is found only in the streams of eastern Arizona’s White Mountains. It is one of just two trout species native to the state and is sacred to the White Mountain Apache Tribe.
The fish gained protection under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 because of habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species. It was subsequently moved to the threatened list in 1975.",False

HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) — NASCAR is in a stalemate with Michael Jordan and how it ends could potentially get very messy for both sides. 
After more than two years of contentious negotiations over a new revenue agreement, NASCAR last weekend finally got 13 organizations — all but two — to sign a new deal. 
The agreement was reached less than 48 hours before NASCAR’s playoff opener at Atlanta Motor Speedway, and multiple teams told The Associated Press they felt pressured to take what was presented as a “take it or leave it final offer” with the clock ticking on a deadline to sign. 
This may not be the win NASCAR would like it to be.
Jordan and the 23XI Racing team he co-owns refused to sign the deal Friday night. Front Row Motorsports, a much smaller organization, surprisingly took the same stance as high-powered 23XI. 
23XI and Front Row are the only two current chartered organizations that did not sign extensions that run through 2031. Because of a non-disparagement clause NASCAR added to the latest offer, almost none of the teams that signed are willing to talk on the record about the negotiations and how they eventually gave up on three of their critical demands.
23XI is largely represented in the charter fight with NASCAR by co-owners Denny Hamlin and Jordan confidant Curtis Polk, who arrived at Atlanta with two typed pages of notes he read to reporters to explain why the team did not take NASCAR’s offer. 
Polk described the fight with NASCAR as “David facing Goliath,” with NASCAR essentially threatening to eliminate the charters if the deal wasn’t accepted by midnight. He said other teams “may have felt pressured and compelled to sign the agreement under significant duress.” 


The position at 23XI was that the terms were “particularly harmful to our operations and our ownership group’s interests and intellectual property rights.”
The teams have always wanted four things out of the charter negotiations: a larger share of the revenue, a seat at the table for governance issues, a cut on business deals NASCAR does that uses team or driver likenesses, and, most importantly, for charters to become permanent, locking in stability. 
Jim France, a son of NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. and current chairman, was never going to make the charters permanent and it became a major sticking point. The final offer did not include permanent charters; it also has language that would allow the series-owning France family to hold charters and field their own teams, according to multiple team owners.
Jeff Gordon, the vice chairman of Hendrick Motorsports and a key member of the team negotiating group, simply shrugged about the decision to sign the charter agreement when asked by The Associated Press. He noted that Jim France had individual meetings with several top team owners — a strategy Hamlin has described as “dividing and conquering” — and that most felt they were never going to get a better offer from NASCAR. 
The new charters does provide teams with increased revenue, but how much is murky. 
Multiple teams told AP the document was riddled with grammatical errors and not something ready for signing. The teams sent revisions — requests, actually — back to NASCAR and NASCAR’s response landed at 5 p.m. Friday at 105 pages long.
According to Front Row owner Bob Jenkins, the document was untenable to be reviewed in time to meet a looming deadline. The team shares many of the same concerns as 23XI, and Jenkins noted “I know a lot of people were uncomfortable but felt like they had to (sign).”
Brad Keselowski, co-owner of RFK Racing, disputed the notion that teams felt “forced” to sign and instead believes the teams had reached a point where NASCAR would give them nothing more. 
He wouldn’t categorize the new charter agreement as “fair” to the teams. 
“It’s one of these agreements that is only good when everybody’s just a little bit jaded,” Keselowski said. “I think there’s things obviously we would like to have better, but I think to some degree, there’s pieces that we really like, and there’s pieces not so much. But it’s hard to use the word ‘fair.’ I don’t know if I know what that means.”
It’s not clear what 23XI and Front Row will do next. 
Polk wouldn’t say if the team will pursue legal action after earlier consulting with one of the country’s top antitrust and sports lawyers. If 23XI wants to go to court, it could try to force NASCAR — a privately owned family company — to publicly open its books. 
“This isn’t the 1960s, and these predatory practices will not withstand scrutiny and be accepted in 2024,” Polk said. “NASCAR has superior bargaining power and undue influence over the sport and the charter process. They wielded this power continuously over the past few months and consistently rejected broad team requests on major issues while providing minor changes for pet issues that some teams requested in one-on-one meetings.”
Polk had no answer as to why NASCAR wants to take on Jordan, a global superstar who brings a new audience to the sport and is one of only two Black owners in the Cup Series. Polk said the last discussions 23XI leadership had with the France family were in May. 
“I’m not going to speculate as to what we’re going to do,” Polk said. “We’re going to protect our rights, and whatever we have to do to protect our rights is what we’ll do.”
But he was clear on 23XI’s position and wondered if many who did sign are even aware of what is in the 105 pages. 
“The contract offer took away essential rights, and we believe that all teams, including those who signed, may not have been given a true opportunity to negotiate or fully understand the implications of the contract terms,” he said. “It’s important to fully consider the long-term implications of these terms, which could be detrimental not just to all teams but to the sport as a whole.”
There’s nine races left in this season and both 23XI and Front Row are trying to expand to three cars for next year. They will theoretically need charters to do that — and right now, those charters are set to be revoked at the end of December.

DEER PARK, Texas (AP) — A towering flame gradually subsided Tuesday morning in the aftermath of a massive pipeline explosion after a vehicle drove through a fence and struck an above-ground valve, officials said.
Deer Park officials said police and local FBI agents initiated investigations and found no preliminary reports that would suggest a coordinated or “terrorist” attack and that “this appears to be an isolated incident.”
The investigation included efforts to learn more about the driver of a vehicle that was incinerated by the pipeline explosion as flames scorched the ground across a wide radius, severed adjacent power transmission lines and ignited homes at a distance. Police did not provide any information about the person’s condition.
An evacuation area included nearly 1,000 homes and initial shelter orders included schools.
Operators shut off the flow of natural gas liquids in the pipeline, but so much remained in the miles of tubing that firefighters could do nothing but watch and hose down adjacent homes.
Deer Park Mayor Jerry Mouton Jr. described intense heat from a fire that endured for more than 12 hours as ladder trucks showered houses from above.
“A lot of the house structures that are adjacent to that are still catching on fire even though we’re putting a lot of water on them,” Mouton said at an afternoon news conference. A spewing flame still lit up the sky at sunset Monday.




Firefighters initially were dispatched at 9:55 a.m., after an explosion at a valve station in Deer Park, adjacent to La Porte, rattled homes and businesses, including a Walmart. Deer Park officials said an SUV drove into the valve after going through a fence on the side of the Walmart parking lot.
At the news conference, officials said only one person, a firefighter, sustained a minor injury. Later, Deer Park spokesperson Kaitlyn Bluejacket said four people were injured. She didn’t provide details about the severity of the injuries.
Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said in a statement that 20 miles (32 kilometers) of pipeline between the two closed valves had to burn off before the fire would stop.
Anna Lewis, who was walking into the nearby Walmart when the explosion happened, said it sounded “like a bomb went off.” She said everyone inside was rushed to the back of the store and then taken across the street to a grocery store before being bussed to a community center.
“It scared me,” she said. “You really don’t know what to do when it’s happening.”
Geselle Melina Guerra said she and her boyfriend heard the explosion as they were having breakfast in their mobile home. 
“All of a sudden we hear this loud bang and then I see something bright, like orange, coming from our back door that’s outside,” said Guerra, who lives within the evacuation area. 
Guerra’s boyfriend, Jairo Sanchez, said they’re used to evacuations because they live close to other plants near the highway, but he hadn’t seen an explosion before in his 10 years living there.
“We just drove as far as we could because we didn’t know what was happening,” Sanchez said.
Houston, Texas’ largest city, is the nation’s petrochemical heartland and is home to a cluster of refineries and plants and thousands of miles of pipelines. Explosions and fires are a familiar sight in the area, including some that have been deadly, raising recurring questions about the adequacy of industry efforts to protect the public and the environment.
Letting the fire burn out is better, from an environmental perspective, than trying to attack the flames with some kind of suppressing foam or liquid, said Ramanan Krishnamoorti, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Houston.
“Otherwise it’s going to release a lot of volatile organics into the environment,” he said.
Still, there will undoubtedly be negative environmental consequences, including a release of soot, carbons and organic material, he said. 
The pipeline’s owner, Dallas-based Energy Transfer, said air monitoring equipment was being set up near the plume of fire and smoke, which could be seen from at least 10 miles (16 kilometers) away at one point. 
A statement from Harris County Pollution Control on Monday afternoon said no volatile organic compounds had been detected. The statement said particulate matter from the smoke was moderate and not an immediate risk to healthy people, although “sensitive populations may want to take precautions.” The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said it was also monitoring the air.
Natural gas liquids are used primarily in the manufacturing of plastics and basic and intermediate chemicals, Krishnamoorti said. 
The fire burned through nearby power lines, and the website PowerOutage.us said several thousand customers were without power at one point in Harris County.
Krishnamoorti said the area’s extensive pipeline infrastructure will have to be closely inspected for damage beyond the explosion site, though the fire “won’t be a major disrupter of supply chains.”
The Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates oil and gas in the state, said its safety inspectors were investigating.
Margaret Newman, who lives on the edge of the evacuation zone, said that when she heard the explosion she went out into her yard and could see the flame shooting above the trees. She lost electricity but has a generator to keep her home cool and planned to stay put.
This story has been updated to correct that the pipeline carries natural gas liquids, not liquified natural gas.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Imagine a customer-service center that speaks your language, no matter what it is.
Alorica, a company in Irvine, California, that runs customer-service centers around the world, has introduced an artificial intelligence translation tool that lets its representatives talk with customers who speak 200 different languages and 75 dialects.
So an Alorica representative who speaks, say, only Spanish can field a complaint about a balky printer or an incorrect bank statement from a Cantonese speaker in Hong Kong. Alorica wouldn’t need to hire a rep who speaks Cantonese.
Such is the power of AI. And, potentially, the threat: Perhaps companies won’t need as many employees — and will slash some jobs — if chatbots can handle the workload instead. But the thing is, Alorica isn’t cutting jobs. It’s still hiring aggressively.
The experience at Alorica — and at other companies, including furniture retailer IKEA — suggests that AI may not prove to be the job killer that many people fear. Instead, the technology might turn out to be more like breakthroughs of the past — the steam engine, electricity, the internet: That is, eliminate some jobs while creating others. And probably making workers more productive in general, to the eventual benefit of themselves, their employers and the economy.
Nick Bunker, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said he thinks AI “will affect many, many jobs — maybe every job indirectly to some extent. But I don’t think it’s going to lead to, say, mass unemployment. We have seen other big technological events in our history, and those didn’t lead to a large rise in unemployment. Technology destroys but also creates. There will be new jobs that come about.’’
At its core, artificial intelligence empowers machines to perform tasks previously thought to require human intelligence. The technology has existed in early versions for decades, having emerged with a problem-solving computer program, the Logic Theorist, built in the 1950s at what’s now Carnegie Mellon University. More recently, think of voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. Or IBM’s chess-playing computer, Deep Blue, which managed to beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.


AI really burst into public consciousness in 2022, when OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, the generative AI tool that can conduct conversations, write computer code, compose music, craft essays and supply endless streams of information. The arrival of generative AI has raised worries that chatbots will replace freelance writers, editors, coders, telemarketers, customer-service reps, paralegals and many more. 
“AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function,’' Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in May. 
Yet the widespread assumption that AI chatbots will inevitably replace service workers, the way physical robots took many factory and warehouse jobs, isn’t becoming reality in any widespread way — not yet, anyway. And maybe it never will.
The White House Council of Economic Advisers said last month that it found “little evidence that AI will negatively impact overall employment.’’ The advisers noted that history shows technology typically makes companies more productive, speeding economic growth and creating new types of jobs in unexpected ways.
They cited a study this year led by David Autor, a leading MIT economist: It concluded that 60% of the jobs Americans held in 2018 didn’t even exist in 1940, having been created by technologies that emerged only later.
The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks job cuts, said it has yet to see much evidence of layoffs that can be attributed to labor-saving AI.
“I don’t think we’ve started seeing companies saying they’ve saved lots of money or cut jobs they no longer need because of this,’’ said Andy Challenger, who leads the firm’s sales team. “That may come in the future. But it hasn’t played out yet.’’
At the same time, the fear that AI poses a serious threat to some categories of jobs isn’t unfounded. 
Consider Suumit Shah, an Indian entrepreneur who caused a uproar last year by boasting that he had replaced 90% of his customer support staff with a chatbot named Lina. The move at Shah’s company, Dukaan, which helps customers set up e-commerce sites, shrank the response time to an inquiry from 1 minute, 44 seconds to “instant.” It also cut the typical time needed to resolve problems from more than two hours to just over three minutes.
“It’s all about AI’s ability to handle complex queries with precision,’' Shah said by email.
The cost of providing customer support, he said, fell by 85%. 
“Tough? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely,’’ Shah posted on X.
Dukaan has expanded its use of AI to sales and analytics. The tools, Shah said, keep growing more powerful.
“It’s like upgrading from a Corolla to a Tesla,’' he said. “What used to take hours now takes minutes. And the accuracy is on a whole new level.’' 
Similarly, researchers at Harvard Business School, the German Institute for Economic Research and London’s Imperial College Business School found in a study last year that job postings for writers, coders and artists tumbled within eight months of the arrival of ChatGPT.
A 2023 study by researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University concluded that telemarketers and teachers of English and foreign languages held the jobs most exposed to ChatGPT-like language models. But being exposed to AI doesn’t necessarily mean losing your job to it. AI can also do the drudge work, freeing up people to do more creative tasks. 
The Swedish furniture retailer IKEA, for example, introduced a customer-service chatbot in 2021 to handle simple inquiries. Instead of cutting jobs, IKEA retrained 8,500 customer-service workers to handle such tasks as advising customers on interior design and fielding complicated customer calls.
Chatbots can also be deployed to make workers more efficient, complementing their work rather than eliminating it. A study by Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University and Danielle Li and Lindsey Raymond of MIT tracked 5,200 customer-support agents at a Fortune 500 company who used a generative AI-based assistant. The AI tool provided valuable suggestions for handling customers. It also supplied links to relevant internal documents.
Those who used the chatbot, the study found, proved 14% more productive than colleagues who didn’t. They handled more calls and completed them faster. The biggest productivity gains — 34% — came from the least-experienced, least-skilled workers.
At an Alorica call center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, one customer-service rep had been struggling to gain access to the information she needed to quickly handle calls. After Alorica trained her to use AI tools, her “handle time’’ — how long it takes to resolve customer calls — fell in four months by an average of 14 minutes a call to just over seven minutes.
Over a period of six months, the AI tools helped one group of 850 Alorica reps reduce their average handle time to six minutes, from just over eight minutes. They can now field 10 calls an hour instead of eight — an additional 16 calls in an eight-hour day.
Alorica agents can use AI tools to quickly access information about the customers who call in — to check their order history, say, or determine whether they had called earlier and hung up in frustration.
Suppose, said Mike Clifton, Alorica’s co-CEO, a customer complains that she received the wrong product. The agent can “hit replace, and the product will be there tomorrow,” he said. “ ‘Anything else I can help you with? No?’ Click. Done. Thirty seconds in and out.’’

SEATTLE (AP) — Just three games into his tenure, Mike Macdonald has the Seattle Seahawks off to a perfect start and already with a two-game division lead. 
Meanwhile, the Miami Dolphins are again facing questions about who will be under center at quarterback moving forward. 
“All that matters is that we win, however that we get it done,” Seattle QB Geno Smith said. “I’m not really particular about that, but 3-0, it’s a great start.”
Smith threw for 289 yards and a 71-yard touchdown to DK Metcalf, Zach Charbonnet rushed for two TDs, and the Seahawks beat Miami 24-3 on Sunday where the attention turned to another injury suffered by a Dolphins quarterback.
A week after losing Tua Tagovailoa to the third concussion in the past two years, the Dolphins watched Skylar Thompson suffer a chest injury in the second half, leaving Tim Boyle to try to lead the charge back from a 17-3 deficit.
Boyle was unable to direct a comeback and the Dolphins (1-2) were stuck back in a place of uncertainty about their QB situation.
Miami coach Mike McDaniel said Thompson suffered a painful rib injury. 
“You have to look at everything and you have to find a way to give your team the best chance to win,” McDaniel said. “I think in 2022, this was something that happened to us as well and ultimately the rest of the league does not care, nor should they. So, we have to find a way to get better collectively.”
Thompson was hurt in the third quarter, staying down after being shoved by Dre’Mont Jones following a pass to De’Von Achane. But the injury was likely suffered on the previous drive when Thompson was sacked by Tyrel Dodson and was hunched over at the midsection as he ran off the field.


Thompson was 13 of 19 for 107 yards before leaving. He was also sacked five times.

Seattle is the first team since the Steelers in 1979 to start 3-0 and hold each of those opponents to under 150 yards passing. Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle combined for seven catches for just 66 yards. 
“It’s such a dangerous team. You know the usual suspects,” Macdonald said. “When they get their hands on the ball you’ve got to take great angles, you need inside-out pursuit, you’ve got to set the edge. I thought our front played incredibly hard.” 
Tagovailoa made the trip to Seattle just over a week after suffering the concussion against Buffalo on Sept. 12. The Dolphins expressed confidence that Thompson would be able to step in and keep their potent offense moving.
But all Miami could manage was Jason Sanders’ 23-yard field goal in the first quarter. Miami had just 205 total yards. 
“I’ve never won a game scoring three points, so I think collectively starting with me it has to be better. We have to get it figured out fast,” McDaniel said. 
Miami had a chance to pull within one score early in the fourth quarter following Smith’s second interception of the game — a pass that was deflected by Calais Campbell and grabbed out of the air by Zach Sieler. Miami reached the Seattle 3, but failed on four attempts and turned the ball over on downs. 
Seattle answered that defensive stand with a 98-yard scoring drive, capped by Charbonnet’s 10-yard TD run with 4:55 left. Charbonnet finished with 91 yards rushing on 18 carries, while Smith was 26 of 34 passing, including the long TD toss to Metcalf.
Seattle improved to 3-0 for the first time since 2020. 
“We always talk about closing the game and for the offense that was our opportunity to go close the game ... and just be on the attack right there. I think we did a great job,” Charbonnet said. 
Seattle’s offense was humming early with Smith throwing for 133 yards in the first quarter. The big shot came on the final play of the first quarter when Metcalf used a double move to flash open and Smith found him for his seventh career touchdown catch of 50 yards or more. 
But after that opening quarter it was a rather miserable afternoon for the Seahawks on that side of the ball with drives often stymied by penalties. The teams were each flagged for 11 accepted penalties with several more declined or offsetting. 
“I think that’s the only thing that stopped us today was the stupid penalties that we had,” Metcalf said. 
Along with Thompson, the Dolphins lost starting left tackle Terron Armstead (eye) and cornerback Kendall Fuller (concussion) to injuries in the first half.
Seattle lost significant depth on the defensive line as rookie first round pick Byron Murphy II (hamstring) and Leonard Williams (ribs) were both lost to injuries in the first half. Both were ruled out at halftime.

Publication date:2024-09-27 06:14:00

PARIS (AP) — Chemena Kamali’s sophomore collection for Chloé was a luminous exploration of femininity, blending the house’s heritage with a fresh, sensual energy for spring. Set against a backdrop of sun-faded apricots, blushes and soft whites, the Paris collection captured Kamali’s vision of a summer that she surmised as: “when you pause, escape, explore and recharge.” It celebrated Chloé’s free-spirited DNA, infused with a lightness that felt both nostalgic and forward-looking.
Here are some highlights of Thursday’s shows at Paris Fashion Week, including a French honor for Naomi Campbell:
“There’s a liberating expression of total freedom,” Kamali said of her spring display. 
This freedom flowed through silk charmeuse gowns, lingerie-inspired crop tops and peek-a-boo designs.
Echoes of Karl Lagerfeld’s ‘70s Chloé lingered in exaggerated shoulders and standout pieces, like a loose-fitting, vivid blue coat. “Chloé is not a passing moment; it’s an eternal state of mind,” Kamali noted, grounding her collection in the house’s long-standing ethos of optimism and instinct.
Layering played a central role, but Kamali kept it light and intuitive, reflecting what she called a “very personal way of dressing.” Sheer fabrics and sun-worn lace mixed effortlessly with ribbed jerseys, creating looks that felt weightless and spontaneous, a signature of Kamali’s debut collection. “What matters to me is the feeling and intuition,” she said.
A standout moment came in the form of a dramatic trapeze-shaped silk gown, its dynamic silhouette swirling with movement. It epitomized Kamali’s ability to honor Chloé’s romantic roots while infusing a modern sensibility. “The mood is light, weightless, sensual and joyful,” she explained. That joyful freedom was a defining thread from start to finish.


With her second outing, Kamali proved she is the right designer to lead Chloé. She crafted a spring collection that balanced nostalgia and sensuality while pushing the house toward a bright, optimistic future.
Casey Cadwallader delivered a striking show for Mugler, equal parts theatrical and innovative. The hair, sculpted into harsh fringes like a viper’s fang, set the tone for a collection defined by sharp architectural lines. Curving lapels adorned tight jackets, while tendrils of latticed silk flowed into skirts that bled vibrant yellows, creating a visual spectacle.
The collection boldly embraced femininity, featuring a bust that echoed the form of seashells and a densely packed bustier resembling a diving whale. This daring aesthetic aligns with Cadwallader’s aim to infuse the brand with a fresh energy, moving away from the extravagance that some original Mugler fans long for. 
Oversized tubular arms complemented a webbed skirt-coat, while a transparent loose trench evoked the look of a sea medusa, reinforcing Cadwallader’s commitment to pushing boundaries. 
Iconic British model Naomi Campbell was awarded a prestigious honor in France, being named a knight in the Order of Arts and Letters at the culture ministry for her significant contributions to French culture.
However, this recognition comes as Campbell faces scrutiny back home, having been barred from serving as a charity trustee in England and Wales for five years. This decision follows a three-year investigation into the financial activities of her charity, “Fashion for Relief,” which was found to have been “poorly governed” and lacking in “adequate financial management.”
The Charity Commission, which oversees charities in England and Wales, reported multiple instances of misconduct, revealing that only 8.5% of the charity’s expenditures went to charitable grants over a six-year period from 2016. Notably, the inquiry uncovered that charity funds were misused for Campbell’s luxury hotel stays during events in Cannes, alongside personal expenses such as spa treatments and room service.
In response to a question from the AP, Campbell said, “I’ve just found out today about the findings and I am extremely concerned. We are investigating on our side. I was not in control of my charity; I put the control in the hands of a legal employer. We are investigating to find out what and how, and everything I do and every penny I ever raised goes to charity.”
Alongside Campbell, fellow trustee Bianka Hellmich has been disqualified for nine years after receiving unauthorized payments for consultancy services, while trustee Veronica Chou has been barred for four years. The charity, founded in 2005 to unite the fashion industry in addressing global poverty, was dissolved earlier this year, having raised over $15 million for various causes worldwide.
Despite the controversy, Campbell’s honor in France highlights her lasting impact on the cultural landscape.
At Thursday’s show at the Palais de Tokyo, Rick Owens unleashed a captivating spectacle that felt like a dramatic descent into a realm inhabited by gothic aliens. The atmosphere was thick with smoke and suspense as an army of biblical figures marched out in impressive diagonal formations, their asymmetrical knee-high leather boots featuring translucent heels, making each step a statement.
Owens’ trademark angular, alien-like geometric shoulders dominated the runway, capturing the essence of his singular vision—one that merges dark romanticism with avant-garde aesthetics. The collection was a testament to his ability to blend his gothic instincts with a sense of reverent irreverence, reminiscent of the “delicate time” he referenced in previous collections, where beauty and horror coexist.
As the show unfolded, a billowing coven emerged, clad in oversized black priest-like hoods and flowing tulle cloaks that draped elegantly over their forms. Some models donned discreet headscarves, striking a balance between reverence and defiance, perfectly embodying Owens’ commentary on societal norms. This juxtaposition echoes his commitment to inclusivity, presenting a vision of fashion that celebrates diversity while challenging conventional beauty standards.
The intricate craftsmanship used in the collection exemplified Owens’ mastery. Each piece, from the cloaks to the striking silhouettes, invited viewers to appreciate humble fabrics. This aligns with his insistence that he presents “the most excellent aesthetics” possible, recognizing the nuanced interplay between the dark and the light in our world.
While some may find Owens’ aesthetic too avant-garde or even gloomy, this show reaffirmed his position as a provocative force in fashion. The theatricality and elaborate design remind us of his role as one of the last independent designers in Paris, navigating the complexities of the fashion landscape with fierce authenticity.

Vice President Kamala Harris gave a speech Friday focused squarely on abortion rights to voters in Georgia, where news reports have documented women’s deaths in the face of the state’s six-week ban.
Meanwhile, lawmakers are scrambling to ensure that the U.S. Secret Service has enough money and resources to keep the nation’s presidential candidates safe amid repeated threats of violence. The efforts follow a July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally and after a second apparent attempt last weekend at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida.
With early voting beginning Friday in three states, voters are split on whether Harris or Trump would better handle the economy, a new AP-NORC poll finds.
Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.
Here’s the latest:
Her family lived in Wisconsin when she was growing up and her parents worked at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
She told the crowd of thousands she has Wisconsin “cred” and on a recent visit went by the house where her family lived.
“Every time I land the governor says ‘welcome home,’” Harris says. 
MADISON, Wis. — Vice President Kamala Harris’ rally on Friday in the Democratic stronghold of Madison continues a long tradition of Democratic candidates for president drawing huge crowds in the capital city of the battleground state.


Harris attracted a capacity crowd of about 10,000 people at a stadium where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders drew a similar size in July 2015, which was the largest Sanders rally up to that point.
The largest political rally in Madison the past 20 years occurred In October 2004 when Democratic nominee John Kerry and rocker Bruce Springsteen attracted about 80,000 people on the streets surrounding the Capitol. Four years later in 2008, candidate Barack Obama filled a stadium on the University of Wisconsin campus with about 19,000 people in attendance.
Obama was back with Springsteen in 2012 for a rally outside the Capitol that drew an estimated 18,000 people.
Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in 2016, famously did not campaign in Wisconsin after her primary win. She narrowly lost the state to Republican Donald Trump that year and many Democrats blamed that on her not campaigning in the state.
There were no large rallies during the 2020 campaign because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Harris stop on Friday was her fourth to Wisconsin as the nominee and first to Madison. Trump has been to Wisconsin for five rallies this year and during the Republican National Convention, which was held in Milwaukee.
Harris will speak at an evening rally in the heavily Democratic state capital of Madison, where some voters said they’re eager to hear more about where she stands on issues.
“I’d like to hear more details,” said Rabindra Upreti, 51, of Madison. He said he especially wanted to hear her talk more about her plans for the economy, especially how she will bring down housing costs.
“I don’t know how she’s going to cover that,” Upreti said. “I want her to break down more details.”
Brittany Thompson, 34, of Madison, also wants more information about her plans for affordable housing.
What to know about the 2024 Election
“Her story is compelling, but I would like to hear more,” Thompson said.
While Madison, home to the University of Wisconsin, is a Democratic stronghold, the race statewide in Wisconsin is expected to be tight.
During her speech Friday in battleground Georgia, Harris shared the story of Amber Thurman, a mother who decided to have an abortion after she became pregnant again. She developed sepsis and died while waiting more than 20 hours at the hospital for a routine medical procedure after taking abortion pills.
The vice president said Thurman “should be alive today.” 
Harris blasted Donald Trump as a threat to women’s freedoms and their very lives, warning Georgia voters that he would choke off access to abortion if he returns to the White House. 
The Democratic vice president’s visit came days after ProPublica reported that two women in the state died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies.
Such deaths, Harris said, were not only preventable but predictable because of laws that have been implemented since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Although Georgia’s six-week ban allows abortions in early pregnancy to save a mother’s life, critics say the law has created dangerous confusion for doctors about when they’re allowed to provide care. 
A Beverly Hills fundraiser featuring Barack Obama is expected to bring in over $4 million for Kamala Harris’ election effort.
The Friday event is intended to be smaller than other blowout fundraisers for the Democratic ticket over the past year in the beating heart of America’s entertainment industry, which have featured entertainers such as Lenny Kravitz. The minimum donation for a ticket is $50,000, according to a Los Angeles-based consultant.
It will be held at the home of James Costos, the former president’s ambassador to Spain, and his partner Michael Smith. It’s not the only fundraiser for Harris to be held in the Los Angeles area on Friday. Hillary Clinton was slated to appear at an event hosted by Sybil and Matthew Orr, said the consultant, who insisted on anonymity to provide private details for the events.
Nearly eight years removed from office, the $4 million figure raised by Obama suggests he has still has lasting star power in Hollywood.
Harris’ campaign is airing a new ad in battleground North Carolina, aiming to highlight Trump’s ties to the embattled GOP gubernatorial nominee and top Trump surrogate.
The ad alternates between Trump’s praise for Robinson and the lieutenant governor’s comments in support of a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. It comes as Harris is set to give a speech Friday focused squarely on abortion rights in Georgia, where news reports have documented women’s deaths in the face of the state’s six-week ban.
Her campaign says Harris’ ad is its first to link Trump to a down-ballot candidate. The rollout follows a CNN report Thursday about Robinson’s alleged posts on a pornography website’s message board. Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include racial and sexual comments. He said wouldn’t be forced out of the race by “salacious tabloid lies.”
Trump campaigns in Wilmington on Saturday, but a person on the Trump campaign, and a second person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, told AP that Robinson will not be with him.
The Harris campaign says the ad is part of its $370 million in digital and television advertising reservations between Labor Day and Election Day.
In addition, the Democratic National Committee is running billboards in nine places across North Carolina, including Robinson’s hometown of Greensboro, showing a photo of him standing alongside Trump. There’s also text of positive things the Republican presidential nominee and former president has said about Robinson.
President Joe Biden invited a special guest to his meeting with his Cabinet on Friday: his wife, Jill Biden. It was her first time attending.
Biden called on her to update the group on a new White House effort to change the approach to and boost funding for research into women’s health issues.
The first lady said “incredible progress” had been made since she and the president launched the initiative in November after she learned about “huge gaps in our understanding of women’s health.”
She called out several departments and agencies, including Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health, for committing hundreds of millions of dollars to spur research and innovation.
The first lady said she’ll be making a new announcement on Monday in New York.
She said the steps taken so far are “building momentum for this research” but added, “We have to keep moving forward.”
In-person voting for this year’s presidential election has officially begun, kicking off the six-week sprint to Election Day.
Voters lined up Friday to cast their ballots in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia, the states with the first early in-person voting opportunities. About a dozen more states will follow by mid-October.
Some of the voters who cast ballots Friday suggested that they didn’t want to wait, hoping to avoid the potential for trouble or chaos at the polls after a summer of political turmoil.
Other early voters might opt for early in-person balloting instead of mail-in absentee ballots to ensure their votes get counted, given the ongoing struggles of the U.S. Postal Service.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has often sought to sow doubt about mail voting and encouraged voters to cast ballots in person on Election Day. But this year, Trump and the Republican National Committee, which he now controls, have begun to embrace early and mail voting as a way to lock in GOP votes before Election Day, just as Democrats have done for years.
At a polling site in Minneapolis, Jason Miller arrived well before the polls opened at 8 a.m. and was first in line. He was among roughly 75 people who cast ballots in the first hour at the city’s early voting center.
“Why not try to be first? That’s kind of fun, right?” said the 37-year-old house painter.
The Teamsters Rail Conference, which represents 70,000 members, endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz on Friday.
The announcement comes as a flurry of Teamsters locals back the Democratic ticket even though the national union declined to make an endorsement in the presidential race.
“The lives and livelihoods of railroaders are more dependent than most workers on decisions made by the federal government,” said the Teamsters Rail Conference, which cited Democrats’ support for worker-friendly regulations like paid sick leave.
The rail workers’ endorsement differs from a previous statement from the Teamsters’ national leadership, which cited Harris’ stance on rail strikes as a reason not to endorse her.
Vice President Kamala Harris said she’s “very proud” to have earned Taylor Swift’s endorsement but poked at the pop superstar over the Super Bowl in a new video interview released Friday.
The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 to win February’s game.
Harris and Swift supported opposing teams. Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney, is a 49ers fan, while Swift backs the Chiefs. Her boyfriend is Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.
In WIRED’s Autocomplete Interview, which Harris sat for earlier this week, she noted the split with Swift over the Super Bowl but said, “Who’s mad at anyone for being loyal to their team?”
On Swift’s endorsement, Harris said, “I am very proud to have the support of Taylor Swift” and described the singer-songwriter as “an incredible artist.”
“I really respect the courage that she has had in her career to stand up for what she believes is right,” the vice president said.
Swift announced her endorsement shortly after the conclusion of Harris’ debate on Sept. 10 with Republican Donald Trump.
Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales
Washington, D.C., has a new tourist stop that surely will be made over once the next president settles into office.
“The Peoples’s House: A Washington Experience” is set to open on Monday, covering three floors in an office building a block from the White House.
The education center boasts a full-scale replica of the Oval Office decorated just as President Joe Biden’s currently is — right down to his desk, the armchairs in front of the fireplace and the weathered family Bible resting on a side table.
But it won’t look that way for long.
The plan is to update the replica Oval next year after either Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump is elected in November and assumes office, and the décor is set.
The replica will always mirror the Oval Office of the sitting president, so it will be updated regularly, said Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association.
The nonprofit organization raised money to open the education center.
Admission is free; timed tickets are required.
Vice President Kamala Harris has grown more open about her gun ownership in recent weeks, but on Thursday she for the first time said what she’d do with the handgun she owns.
Speaking during a campaign event hosted by the talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Harris was addressing her efforts to cut down on violence and pass a new ban on assault-style weapons, when she referenced owning a handgun — surprising Winfrey.
“If somebody’s breaking into my house they’re gettin shot,” Harris added. She continued: “I probably shouldn’t have said that. My staff will deal with that later.”
A live stream with Vice President Kamala Harris and talk show host Oprah Winfrey billed as a “Unite for America” rally kicked off Thursday night with more than 230,000 viewers on YouTube alone even before Harris joined, as the Democrat looks to digital-first events to reach voters. 
The event was hosted by Winfrey from suburban Michigan, one of this election’s key battlegrounds, and leaned on celebrities like Brian Cranston, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Rock, and Meryl Streep, but also the stories of ordinary voters to promote Harris’s message. 
“I want to bring my daughters to the White House to meet this Black woman president,” said comedian Chris Rock.
Donald Trump appeared before Jewish leaders in Washington D.C. on Thursday to talk about antisemitism.
But as the former president is wont to do, he took a large detour at the top of his speech, name-checking his Republican allies in the crowd, discussing the Green New Deal “scam” and pontificating about his polling numbers at length.
Trump was roughly an hour late to his speech, which was slated to begin around 6 p.m.
“Kamala Harris has done absolutely nothing. She has not lifted a single finger to protect you, or protect your children, or even protect you with words... I’m here to tell you today that this ugly kind of antisemitic hate for all of us — bigotry and hate — will be turned back ... starting at noon on Jan. 23rd,” he said. 
“With your vote, I will be your protector and defender and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.”",False

NEW YORK (AP) — Toy maker MGA Entertainment must pay $71.5 million in damages for infringing on the name and likeliness of teen pop group OMG Girlz with one of its popular lines of dolls, a federal jury has decided.
Monday’s verdict hands a win to OMG Girlz — as well as Xscape singer Tameka “Tiny” Harris and rapper Chris “T.I.” Harris — in the third court trial related to a yearslong intellectual property battle with the California company. Among a web of back-and-forth claims, MGA’s “L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G.” dolls were held to have a name and style similar to that of the all-female band, including seemingly lookalike clothing.
The jury found that a handful of the dolls infringed on OMG Girlz’s “trade dress” and/or misappropriated the “name, likeness and identity” of the music group. As a result, court documents show, jurors awarded OMG Girlz, Tiny and T.I. $17.9 million in real damages plus $53.6 million in punitive damages.
Tiny and T.I. are the mother and stepfather of OMG Girlz member Zonnique Pullins. On Monday, Pullins and her fellow OMG Girlz members Bahja Rodriguez and Breaunna Womack all celebrated the verdict in posts to Instagram.
“This is for creatives everywhere,” Rodriguez wrote. “No longer will we be bullied into silence when it comes to others profiting off of our ideas and creativity.”

Tiny, who has been particularly outspoken about the case over the years, also applauded the decision Monday. 


In 2020, MGA filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgement stating that its “L.O.L. Surprise! O.M.G.” products did not violate any IP rights belonging to OMG Girlz, after receiving a cease-and-desist from the group. But counterclaims were soon filed from OMG Girlz, Tiny and T.I.'s team.
The first trial took place in January 2023, but a mistrial was declared the on grounds that barred testimony accusing the company of cultural appropriation was introduced. The second trial sided with MGA, but the judge later granted OMG Girlz’s request for a retrial.
Neither MGA, whose toy brands also include Bratz and Mini Verse, nor attorneys representing the company immediately responded to The Associated Press’ requests for comment Tuesday on the verdict.
MGA denied allegations of infringement and misappropriation throughout the trial. According to Rolling Stone, Paul J. Loh, one of the company’s lawyers, called the claims “baseless and offensive” in closing arguments — noting that MGA had sold more than 40 million “L.O.L Surprise! O.M.G.” dolls without customer confusion.
In a joint statement, attorneys on the other side of the case applauded OMG Girlz, Tiny, and T.I.'s determination and “courage to stand up for themselves and fight a billion-dollar corporation’s intimidation” — adding that the jury did the right thing by holding MGA “fully accountable.”",False

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Five months after a devastating fire destroyed more than half of Copenhagen’s Old Stock Exchange, workers are set to begin the reconstruction of the 400-year-old building to return it to its former glory.
On Thursday, King Frederik X of Denmark will lay a “foundation stone” within part of a red brick wall that survived the mid-April blaze, commencing a yearslong reconstruction plan. 
“We will do this as fast as possible to have Boersen ready for the Copenhageners, for the Danes, for the world again,” said Lars Daugaard Jepsen, head of reconstruction at Denmark’s Chamber of Commerce, which owns the building. He used the Danish name for the stock exchange building.
On Friday, there will be an open day event where visitors can come and see what is left of the downtown exchange. Construction started in 1615 and first opened in 1624. It is considered a leading example of Dutch Renaissance style in Denmark.
In the early morning of April 16, a violent fire tore through the building, a major tourist attraction. The blaze toppled its green copper roof and iconic dragon-tail spire. Two days later, a large section of the building’s outer wall collapsed inwards.
As the fire raged, many, including ordinary people, ventured in to rescue artworks and around 90% of the cultural objects were rescued from the fire. 
Authorities have yet to reveal the cause of the fire, but it’s believed to have started on the building’s roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of ongoing renovation work to be completed for its anniversary in 2024.


Instead of a renovated building, it’s now a ruin. 
But there are detailed records of its design. 
“We have a lot of pictures, we have a lot of papers, we have a lot of knowledge about this building,” Daugaard Jepsen told The Associated Press, during a recent site tour. “That’s also why we are very optimistic of rebuilding this place.”
He said they want to use the same materials that were available in the construction 400 years ago. 
Before the fire, the chamber of commerce had ordered 80,000 bricks — handmade in Germany and burnt in coal-fired ovens — for renovation work. That order has now increased to 800,000.
The wood used in the 17th century came from a Swedish Baltic Sea island and was already 160 years old when brought to Denmark, Daugaard Jepsen said.
“We are looking for about 800 to 1,000 trees on Gotland, because we will use the same materials,” he said.
Since April, workers have cleared more than 1,000 tons of debris after the fire, which was reminiscent of the April 2019 blaze at the 800-year-old old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. 
But the new construction won’t be exactly as before, Daugaard Jepsen said, adding the interior has changed eight times during its history and will take on a new appearance again.
“Our task is to look forward,” he said. The aim is “to make a building that will stand for at least 400 years.”
The reconstruction cost and a date for when it is expected to be completed have yet to be revealed. But Daugaard Jepsen said the five years it took to rebuild Notre Dame is a “very good guess.”
“We will do it as fast as we can,” he said with a smile.

Publication date:2024-09-08 07:00:00

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are indisputably Baker Mayfield’s team. However, Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and a solid defense are still a big part of their formula for success.
The 29-year-old quarterback threw 289 yards and four touchdowns Sunday to lead the three-time defending NFC South champions to a 37-20 rout of the new-look Washington Commanders and spoil the pro debut of No. 2 overall draft pick Jayden Daniels.
Evans caught two TD passes, and Godwin and rookie Jalen McMillan each scored once for the Bucs, whose defense stymied Daniels and the Commanders’ offense despite beginning the game without two injured starters and losing three cornerbacks along the way.
“We got to spread it around a bunch. A lot of guys got the ball,” said Godwin, who had eight catches for 83 yards. “I think we have the potential to be a really dominant offense.”
Daniels was more effective running the ball than passing, scoring a pair of rushing TDs for Washington, which is aiming for a fresh start with the 2023 Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback, Dan Quinn as the coach and Kliff Kingsbury and Joe Whitt Jr. running the offense and defense, respectively.
“I grade myself hard. We didn’t win. I like to win,” Daniels said. “Overall, it went pretty well. There’s some stuff as an offense that we left on the field. We’ve got to execute better. It’s a long season. We’re going to move on.”


The former LSU star was one of three rookie starting quarterbacks in Week 1, along with No. 1 pick Caleb Williams of the Chicago Bears and 12th pick Bo Nix of the Denver Broncos. He joined Robert Griffin III (2012) as the only rookies to start a season opener for Washington since 1967.

“I thought he got to fully express all the things that he has — using his legs, being aggressive down the field,” Quinn said. “Like a number of players tonight, there’s going to be a lot of takeaways. What I can tell you, we got one hell of a competitor.”
Mayfield jumpstarted a fizzling career last season, signing a one-year contract with the Buccaneers and winning Tom Brady’s old job before leading Tampa Bay to a third consecutive division title and a playoff victory.
The 2017 Heisman Trophy winner and No. 1 overall pick from the following year’s draft was rewarded in the offseason with a three-year, $100 million contract that answered any lingering questions about whether the Bucs considered him the QB to lead them forward.
“Pretty efficient for the most part. We just had to be more efficient in the red zone in the first half,” Mayfield said, noting the Bucs settled for field goals of 56, 34 and 29 yards by Chase McLaughlin while building a 16-7 halftime lead.
“We’ll take points always,” Mayfield added, “but we’d love to be able to score touchdowns.”
Mayfield completed 24 of 30 passes without an interception, including TD throws of 1 and 17 yards to Evans, who had five catches for 61 yards. Goodwin scored on a 4-yard reception and McMillan had a 32-yard TD catch in the second half.
Daniels scored on a pair of 1-yard runs after halftime, the last one coming with just under two minutes left. He finished with 88 yards rushing on 16 attempts and went 17 of 24 passing for 184 yards and no interceptions. The Bucs sacked him twice.
Bucs All-Pro safety Antoine Winfield Jr. was penalized for unnecessary roughness — though not ejected — for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Daniels at the end of a 12-yard scramble that helped set up Brian Robinson’s 7-yard TD run in the second quarter.
The contact occurred as Daniels went to the ground on his own.
NFL senior vice president of officiating Perry Fewell told a pool reporter that Winfield was not ejected because there was “incidental contact made by the defender.”
“And it was clear that the defender was attempting to touch the quarterback down on the slide, so we didn’t feel like it rose to the level of a disqualification,” Fewell said.
Daniels’ helmet was knocked off, but the quarterback did not appear to be shaken up. The Bucs were penalized half the distance to the goal, giving the Commanders a first down at the Tampa Bay 11. Robinson scored two plays later.
Winfield had a walking boot on his right foot after the game. ... The Buccaneers played without starting DLs Calijah Kancey (calf) and Logan Hall (foot). ... CB Zyon McCollum (concussion) left the game in the first quarter and did not return. ... CB Bryce Hall (right ankle) was carted off the field early in the third quarter. ... Reserve CB Josh Hayes (ankle) also was ruled out in the second half. The injuries forced the Bucs to play S Christian Izien at cornerback, even though he had no prior experience at the position.
Commanders: Host the NFC East rival New York Giants next Sunday.
Buccaneers: At Detroit next Sunday. The Lions eliminated Tampa Bay in the divisional round of the playoffs last season.

SEATTLE (AP) — The Seattle Kraken and veteran defenseman Adam Larsson reached an agreement Tuesday on a four-year extension that will keep one of their top blue liners under contract through the 2028-29 season.
Larsson’s extension is worth an average of $5.25 million per season and retains one of Seattle’s selections from the 2021 expansion draft for the long term.
The 31-year-old from Sweden has played in 245 of a possible 246 regular-season games during his first three seasons with the Kraken. Most of that time, he’s been part of the top defensive pair for Seattle alongside Vince Dunn, regularly drawing the toughest defensive assignments against the best forwards in the league.
Larsson’s best season with Seattle came in 2022-23, when he had a career-high 33 points including eight goals. Larsson served as an assistant captain the past two seasons and could be a candidate to be the permanent captain if new coach Dan Bylsma opts to have one in his first season.
Larsson started his NHL career with five seasons in New Jersey before being traded to Edmonton ahead of the 2016-17 season. He spent five seasons with the Oilers but was exposed in the expansion draft when Seattle joined the league and the Kraken quickly grabbed the right-shot veteran for their blue line.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The head of the United Nations warned gathered leaders Tuesday that impunity, inequality and uncertainty are driving modern civilization toward “a powder keg that risks engulfing the world” — the latest clarion call from Antonio Guterres that the global situation is becoming intolerable and unsustainable. 

“We can’t go on like this,” the secretary-general said in an alarming state-of-the-world address as he opened the annual high-level gathering of the U.N.’s 193 member nations.

He said the world is in “an era of epic transformation” and facing challenges never seen before, with geopolitical divisions deepening, the planet heating and wars raging in the Middle East, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere with no clue how they will end.

“We are edging towards the unimaginable — a powder keg that risks engulfing the world,” Guterres told presidents, prime ministers and ministers in the vast General Assembly hall.

But he stopped short of saying hope was gone. “The challenges we face,” he said, “are solvable.”



Guterres wasn’t the only one worried about the state of the world.



“I cannot recall a time of greater peril than this,” said King Abdullah II of Jordan. 

Guterres called the situation in Gaza “a nonstop nightmare that threatens to take the entire region with it.” He said escalating air attacks across the Israel-Lebanon border have put Lebanon “at the brink.” In Ukraine, he said, there is no sign of an end to the war that followed Russia’s February 2022 invasion. In Sudan, he said, “a brutal power struggle has unleashed horrific violence,” including widespread rape, and a “humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding as famine spreads.” 

The U.N. chief also pointed to “appalling levels of violence and human suffering” from Myanmar and Congo to Haiti, Yemen and beyond, and the expanding terrorist threat in Africa’s Sahel region. He said the Summit of the Future that preceded Tuesday’s start of the assembly’s nearly weeklong “General Debate,” was a first step. “But we have a long way to go.”

At the two-day summit, the world’s nations adopted a “Pact for the Future.” It’s a blueprint for starting to address challenges from tackling climate change and poverty to putting guardrails on artificial intelligence. It also speaks to reforming the United Nations, and other global institutions established after World War II, to suit the needs and threats in the 21st-century world.
AP correspondent Julie Walker reports world leaders meet at the United Nations under the shadow of global divisions.





Guterres said meeting the challenges of a world “in a whirlwind” requires confronting the three drivers of “unsustainability” — the uncertainty of unmanaged risks, the inequality that underlies injustices and grievances and the impunity that undermines international law and the U.N.‘s founding principles.

“A growing number of governments and others feel entitled to a ‘get out of jail free’ card,” he said — a reference to the classic board game Monopoly.

In his final speech before fellow leaders, President Joe Biden said he recognized the challenges of Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and other global hotspots, but he remains hopeful.

“There will always be forces that pull our countries apart ... a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone,” he said. “Our task is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than the forces pulling us apart.”

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose country speaks first in a tradition dating to the early years of the U.N., criticized Israel’s attacks in Gaza and Lebanon. 

“The right to self-defense became a right for vengeance, which prevents a deal for the release of hostages and delays a cease-fire,” he said.

Lula decried the growth in global military spending for a ninth consecutive year to more than $2.4 trillion. “Those resources could have been used to fight hunger and deal with climate changes,” he said.

Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian — who had accused Israel on Monday of seeking a wider war in the Middle East — laid into Israel in his speech to the assembly Tuesday. He said its attacks in Lebanon in recent days “cannot go unanswered.” 



At last year’s U.N. global gathering, Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, took center stage. But as the first anniversary of Hamas’ deadly attack in southern Israel approaches on Oct. 7, the spotlight is certain to be on the ensuing war in Gaza and escalating violence across the Israeli-Lebanon border, which is now threatening to spread to the wider Middle East.

Zelenskky was in the spotlight Tuesday afternoon at a Security Council meeting on Ukraine on the sidelines of the gathering, and he will be center stage again when he addresses world leaders in the assembly hall on Wednesday morning.

At the high-level council meeting, the Ukrainian leader dismissed the notion of peace talks with Moscow, calling instead for unspecified global “action” to force Russia into peace for invading his country and to comply with the U.N. Charter’s requirement that every country respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all other nations. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused Slovenia, which holds the council’s rotating presidency this month, of giving Zelenskyy a platform “to malign the Russian Federation.” 

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to speak Thursday morning and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday.

On another hot spot, the Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting late Wednesday on the escalating violence in Lebanon at the request of France.

The Denver Broncos suffered a big blow Wednesday with word that top tackler Alex Singleton’s season is over because of a torn ACL.
Coach Sean Payton announced the bad news after the team’s first practice at The Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, where the Broncos (1-2) are working out ahead of their grudge match Sunday at the Meadowlands against the New York Jets (2-1).
The Broncos’ starting inside linebacker and defensive captain, Singleton was injured in the first half of Denver’s 26-7 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last weekend but played all 57 defensive snaps and led the Broncos with 10 tackles.
“I couldn’t tell” he was hurting, fellow defensive captain Patrick Surtain II said. “I mean, he played lights out with a missing ACL. That’s a testament to the type of player he is. Alex, he’s a true competitor ... and seeing a guy out there just give it all for his team speaks volumes for the type of person he is.”
“It just shows how tough he is, shows how much of a leader he is,” concurred quarterback Bo Nix, who added, “It exemplifies what it means to be a captain and that’s why he’s one of ours.”
Payton said Singleton got injured on a play where safety Brandon Jones intercepted Baker Mayfield on the Buccaneers’ second series midway through the first quarter. That was Singleton’s eighth snap, meaning he played 49 more while hurt.


“It was kind of remarkable,” Payton said.
Singleton reported soreness after the game and went for a precautionary MRI, the results of which surprised the coaching staff and Singleton himself, Payton said.
Singleton, who will have surgery in two weeks, led the Broncos in tackles each of the last two seasons with 163 stops in 2022 and 177 last year. Through three weeks this season, he led the team with 31 tackles.

“You can’t replace a guy like Alex,” Nix said, “but you can rise up around him.”
The Broncos promoted running back Tyler Badie from their practice squad to fill Singleton’s roster spot and added a couple of inside linebackers to their practice squad in Kwon Alexander and Zach Cunningham, both of whom were at Wednesday’s practice.
Singleton is in the second season of the three-year, $18 million contract extension he signed in 2023. He earned his first captainship during training camp this summer following the departure of fellow inside linebacker Josey Jewell in free agency.
Singleton also wore the green dot on his helmet, signifying he was the one getting the defensive signals transmitted to him from the sideline.
“Yeah, we’re going to miss him out there on the field,” Surtain said. “But obviously it’s the next man up. It’s an opportunity for the next guys to step in and step up.”
Payton wouldn’t say who will get first crack at that, relaying that he told his team, “I’m not worried about who takes his spot; it’s everyone else picking up the slack.”
Denver ranks third in total defense and second in passing defense so far, and Singleton was as big a reason as any that Denver is allowing just 15.3 points per game.
Notes: Badie was a game-day practice squad call-up the last two weeks and averaged a whopping 8.6 yards on 10 carries. “He’s been real decisive, he’s had some big runs for us,” Payton said. “He’s smart, he knows the system, he’s good in the passing game. He brings a lot.”

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Difficult as it was for Damar Hamlin to deal with his many trepidations in last year’s successful bid to resume playing football following a near-death experience, the Buffalo Bills safety wouldn’t change a thing in retrospect.
Each step of the process — his first practice, first tackle, first game — is what Hamlin believes led to him achieving a new plateau in his comeback in being selected a season-opening starter on Wednesday. 
Coach Sean McDermott made it official by announcing Hamlin will be paired with Taylor Rapp when the Bills take the field in hosting the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.
“Truly a blessing,” Hamlin said.
“I reflect back on the whole process and me not knowing if I would even be able to play again,” he added. “Last season was primarily just about healing and making myself do the hard stuff, thrusting myself into things that were uncomfortable, that made me fearful or gave me anxiety. But I was doing the hard stuff last year to make it easier this year.”
Whether by design or chance, Hamlin sat at the interview table wearing a green pullover with the words “Don’t Quit” printed on the front.
“It aligns with who I am,” he said.
In a mere 20 months, Hamlin has gone from going into cardiac arrest and needing to be resuscitated on the field during a prime-time game at Cincinnati, to the fourth-year player earning a starting spot in a completely retooled secondary.


Both spots were open following the offseason breakup of Buffalo’s seven-year starting tandem, with Jordan Poyer released and Micah Hyde still unsigned and contemplating retirement.
Hamlin, however, was hardly assured being a starter after Buffalo signed fifth-year player Mike Edwards in free agency and then used a second-round pick to draft Cole Bishop. Edwards and Bishop, however, have missed significant time because of injuries, and McDermott credited Hamlin for showing consistency and building an on-field rapport with Rapp.

“What else can’t this young man do?” McDermott said, proudly, referring to Hamlin, a sixth-round pick out of Pittsburgh.
“It’s one thing to come back off of an ACL or a broken bone. It’s another thing to come back off of what he came back off of, right, let alone just decide to play contact football. ... I mean, it’s incredible,” he added. “We’re just extremely proud and full of gratitude to watch him go through what he’s went through and where he is now.”
It wasn’t easy, Hamlin said, but worth it in acknowledging he often reflects back on what happened.
“I think about it all the time. As much as the world experienced it, it happened to me,” Hamlin said. “I enjoy that part of it because it allows me to stay connected with the reason why I’m here ... and I have a second chance at doing things the right way in all areas of my life.”
Hamlin spent two days in a medically induced coma before finally being awakened while surrounded by his family. Doctors diagnosed the cause of Hamlin’s heart stopping as a result of commotio cordis, which happens when a direct blow at a specific point in a heartbeat causes cardiac arrest. Cleared for practice and assured by specialists the chances of a recurrence being slim, Hamlin was gradually eased back into football.
He was limited to appearing in just five games in a backup and special teams role last season. In 2022, Hamlin enjoyed his most playing time in starting 13 games in place of Hyde, who was sidelined by a neck injury.
“I was super excited,” Hamlin said, of being informed he won a starting job.
“Not going to lie, man, it’s like a dream come true to work so hard then get what you worked for,” he added. “But I want to continue on. You know, it’s not about just performing in one game.”
NOTES: The Bills are going with two captains — quarterback Josh Allen and middle linebacker Terrell Bernard — after losing six of eight captains from last year this offseason. The team will also feature a 10-player leadership council. ... WR Curtis Samuel is expected to play and practiced fully after being bothered by a toe injury. Backup QB Mitch Trubisky was limited in practice with a knee injury sustained last month.

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Rio de Janeiro’s main beaches bustle with commotion on sunny weekends. But activity ground to a near standstill on one stretch of sand. People held up their phones to record athletic feats they’d never before witnessed, or even imagined.

The game? Footvolley, a combination of soccer and beach volleyball. The athlete? A 3-year-old border collie named Floki.

Floki sparks wonder among bystanders, because he hangs tough in a game that even humans struggle to get a handle on. Footvolley rules are essentially the same as beach volleyball, but with a slightly lower net and, like soccer, players are forbidden from using hands and arms. Floki springs up from the sand to drive the ball with his mouth. He has become something of an internet sensation in Brazil, with hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram and TikTok.

Floki’s owner, Gustavo Rodrigues, is a footvolley coach, but swears he didn’t plan this. He had wanted an American Bully, a decidedly less sprightly breed. Floki came into Rodrigues’ life instead and quickly revealed his potential when, at just 2 months old, he started jumping after birthday balloons.

Rodrigues started Floki out on what’s called “altinha,” where a group standing in a circle juggles a soccer ball for as long as possible. In 2023, Floki made his debut in the much more complex, competitive game of footvolley — a hobby enjoyed by some Brazilian soccer stars after they retire, including World Cup winners Ronaldinho and Romário.

Footvolley players need poise, agility, coordination, timing, finesse. Covering one side of the court between just two people means quick sprints back and forth on soft sand under the baking sun. It’s no mean feat, but Floki was a natural. A star was born.

“He does things that even some professionals don’t — like positioning on the court,” said Rodrigues, 26. “Sometimes the ball goes from one side (of the court) to the other, and he doesn’t keep his back turned to it. He turns toward the ball to always hit it straight on.” 



It’s clear this high-energy pup lives for this game. Even resting under the shade of the beach’s caipirinha bar, he was laser-focused on the action of the adjacent court’s match. 

When playing, he barks at Rodrigues to pass him the ball and seems to at least understand the basic rules. At times, rather than passing back to Rodrigues for the third and final touch their opponents expect, he sneaks the ball over the net himself to score a point. Then he jumps into Rodrigues’ arms to celebrate.

One of the awestruck onlookers Sunday was Luiza Chioli, who had traveled to Rio from Sao Paulo. She already knew the famous Floki from TikTok, but hadn’t expected front-row seats to watch him while sipping her gin and tonic.

“Seeing social media, we had thought it was just cuts, that they used the best takes,” said Chioli, 21. “But we saw he played, performed the whole time, did really well. It’s really cool.”

As Floki’s follower count has grown, partnerships and endorsement deals have come rolling in. Rodrigues and Floki live in the inland capital Brasilia, but often travel to Rio — footvolley’s mecca — and other Brazilian states to show off his skills, do marketing appearances and create monetized social media content. 

His Sunday began with almost an hour playing beside former footvolley champion Natalia Guitler, who’s been called Queen of the Beach. Between attempts to film her doing a trick pass to him, he scampered for drinks of water or to dip in the ocean. By the end, both she and Floki were scrambling for shade.

“We’re dead,” she said as she collapsed onto the sand next to a panting Floki. Someone passed her a phone to check out the best clips for her Instagram, where she has almost 3 million followers.

“Me and my bestie @dog_altinha playing footvolley,” she wrote in a later post showing their long rally, and which included her bicycle kicking the ball over the net. 

After a rest and another footvolley session, Floki headed to a more remote beach to do a marketing shoot for Farm, a fashion designer that’s become the paragon of Rio’s breezy tropical style, both in Brazil and abroad. 

Then Floki was on Instagram hyping a brand of dog popsicles, gnawing a banana-flavored one himself, and giving an altinha demonstration to mall shoppers. His evening stroll along Copacabana’s beachside promenade showed him straining against his leash, still evidently bursting with his boundless energy.

With their weekend marketing blitz in Rio over, Rodrigues and Floki would head back to Brasilia, where their influencer hustle takes a back seat to the hustle of playing competitive matches. They win about one in every three, Rodrigues said, and their opponents are always desperate to avoid being beaten by a dog.

“It generates talk, and people make fun,” he said. “No one likes to lose a point to him, so people play their hearts out against us.”

Publication date:2024-09-28 17:26:00

BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah led the Lebanese militant group for the past three decades, transforming it into one of the most powerful paramilitary groups in the Middle East.
Hezbollah confirmed Saturday that he was killed in an Israeli air raid that levelled six apartment buildings in Beirut the previous day. 
Read his full obituary here, and here’s a shorter look at the leader:
An astute strategist, the 64-year-old Nasrallah reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with Shiite religious leaders in Iran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas.
Under his leadership, Hezbollah fought wars against Israel and took part in the conflict in neighboring Syria, helping tip the balance of power in favor of President Bashar Assad.
Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah held the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric’s lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam.
A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the United States and much of the West, he was also considered a pragmatist compared to the militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon’s civil war.
Despite the power he wielded, Nasrallah lived largely in hiding for fear of an Israeli assassination.
Born in 1960 into a poor Shiite family in Beirut’s impoverished northern suburb of Sharshabouk, Nasrallah was later displaced to south Lebanon. He studied theology and joined the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization, before becoming one of Hezbollah’s founders.


Hezbollah was formed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard members who came to Lebanon in the summer of 1982 to fight invading Israeli forces. It was the first group that Iran backed and used as a way to export its brand of political Islam.
Nasrallah built a power base as Hezbollah became part of a cluster of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance.
Two days after its leader, 39-year-old Sayyed Abbas Musawi, was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship raid in south Lebanon, Hezbollah chose Nasrallah as its secretary-general in February 1992.
Five years later, the United States designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization.
Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah was credited with leading the war of attrition that led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-year occupation. Nasrallah’s eldest son, Hadi, was killed in 1997, fighting against Israeli forces. 
After Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Nasrallah rose to iconic status both within Lebanon and throughout the Arab world. His messages were beamed on Hezbollah’s own radio and satellite TV station.
That status was further cemented when, in 2006, Hezbollah fought Israel to a stalemate during the 34-day war.
When Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, Hezbollah fighters rushed in, siding with Assad’s forces — even though Hezbollah’s popularity took a dive as the Arab world ostracized Assad.
A day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a “backup front” for Gaza. 
In speeches throughout the conflict, Nasrallah argued that Hezbollah’s cross-border strikes had pulled away Israeli forces that would otherwise be focused on Hamas in Gaza and insisted that Hezbollah would not halt its attacks on Israel until a cease-fire is reached in Gaza.
He maintained a defiant tone, even as tensions rose dramatically in recent weeks with Israel announcing a new phase in the conflict intended to push Hezbollah back from the border to allow thousands displaced from northern Israel to return.
Israel launched strikes killing top military commanders with the group and was blamed for the explosion of thousands of communications devices, mainly used by Hezbollah members, that killed 37 people and wounded thousands.",False

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two Russian state media employees in its most sweeping effort yet to push back against what it says are Russian attempts to spread disinformation ahead of the November presidential election.

The measures, which in addition to indictments also included sanctions and visa restrictions, represented a U.S. government effort just weeks before the November election to disrupt a persistent threat from Russia that American officials have long warned has the potential to sow discord and create confusion among voters. 

Washington has said that Moscow, which intelligence officials have said has a preference for Republican Donald Trump, remains the primary threat to elections even as the FBI continues to investigate a hack by Iran this year that targeted the presidential campaigns of both political parties.
What to know about the 2024 Election

“The Justice Department’s message is clear: We will have no tolerance for attempts by authoritarian regimes to exploit our democratic systems of government,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said. 

One criminal case disclosed by the Justice Department accuses two employees of RT, a Russian state media company, of covertly funding a Tennessee-based content creation company with nearly $10 million to publish English-language videos on social media platforms including TikTok and YouTube with messages in favor of the Russia government’s interests and agenda, including about the war in Ukraine.

The nearly 2,000 videos posted by the company have gotten more than 16 million views on YouTube alone, prosecutors said.

The two defendants, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They are at large. It was not immediately clear if they had lawyers.



The Justice Department says the company did not disclose that it was funded by RT and that neither it nor its founders registered as required by law as an agent of a foreign principal.

Though the indictment does not name the company, it describes it as a Tennessee-based content creation firm with six commentators and with a website identifying itself as “a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.” 

That description exactly matches Tenet Media, an online company that hosts videos made by well-known conservative influencers Tim Pool, Benny Johnson and others. 

Johnson and Pool both responded with posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, calling themselves “victims.” Calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a “scumbag,” Pool wrote that “should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived.”

In his post, Johnson wrote that he had been asked a year ago to provide content to a “media startup.” He said his lawyers negotiated a “standard, arms length deal, which was later terminated.”

Tenet Media’s shows in recent months have featured high-profile conservative guests, including RNC co-chair Lara Trump, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake.

In the other action, officials announced the seizure of 32 internet domains that were used by the Kremlin to spread Russian propaganda and weaken international support for Ukraine. The websites were designed to look like authentic news sites but were actually fake, with bogus social media personas manufactured to appear as if they belonged to American users.

The Justice Department did not identify which candidate in particular the propaganda campaign was meant to boost. But internal strategy notes from participants in the effort released Wednesday by the Justice Department make clear that Trump was the intended beneficiary, even though the names of the candidates were blacked out. 

The proposal for one propaganda project, for instance, states that one of its objectives was to secure a victory for a candidate who is currently out of power and to increase the percentage of Americans who believe the U.S. has been doing too much to support Ukraine. President Joe Biden has strongly supported Ukraine during the invasion by Russia. 

Intelligence agencies have previously charged that Russia, which during the 2016 election launched a massive campaign of foreign influence and interference on Trump’s behalf, was using disinformation to try to meddle in this year’s election. The new steps show the depth of those concerns.

“Today’s announcement highlights the lengths some foreign governments go to undermine American democratic institutions,” the State Department said. “But these foreign governments should also know that we will not tolerate foreign malign actors intentionally interfering and undermining free and fair elections.”

The State Department announced it was taking action against several employees of Russian state-owned media outlets, designating them as “foreign missions,” and offering a cash reward for information provided to the U.S. government about foreign election interference.

It also said it was adding media company Rossiya Segodnya and its subsidiaries RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik to its list of foreign missions. That will require them to register with the U.S. government and disclose their properties and personnel in the U.S.

In a speech last month, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Russia remained the biggest threat to election integrity, accusing Putin and his proxies of “targeting specific voter demographics and swing-state voters to in an effort to manipulate presidential and congressional election outcomes.” Russia, she said was “intent on co-opting unwitting Americans on social media to push narratives advancing Russian interests.”

She struck a similar note Thursday, saying at an Aspen Institute event that the foreign influence threat is more diverse and aggressive than in past years.

“More diverse and aggressive because they involve more actors from more countries than we have ever seen before, operating in a more polarized world than we have ever seen before, all fueled by more technology and accelerated by technology, like AI, and that is what we have exposed in the law enforcement actions we took today,” she said.

Much of the concern around Russia centers on cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns designed to influence the November vote. 

The tactics include using state media like RT to advance anti-U.S. messages and content, as well as networks of fake websites and social media accounts that amplify the claims and inject them into Americans’ online conversations. Typically, these networks seize on polarizing political topics such as immigration, crime or the war in Gaza.

In many cases, Americans may have no idea that the content they see online either originated or was amplified by the Kremlin.

Groups linked to the Kremlin are increasingly hiring marketing and communications firms within Russia to outsource some of the work of creating digital propaganda while also covering their tracks, the officials said during the briefing with reporters.

Two such firms were the subject of new U.S. sanctions announced in March. Authorities say the two Russian companies created fake websites and social media profiles to spread Kremlin disinformation.

The ultimate goal, however, is to get Americans to spread Russian disinformation without questioning its origin. People are far more likely to trust and repost information that they believe is coming from a domestic source, officials said. Fake websites designed to mimic U.S. news outlets and AI-generated social media profiles are just two methods.

Messages left with the Russian Embassy were not immediately returned.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores has agreed to purchase a 27% stake in the Los Angeles Chargers, two people with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press on Friday.
The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the purchase has not been announced by the team. It is expected to be approved by NFL owners at their league meetings in Atlanta next month.
Sports Business Journal first reported Gores’ purchase.
Gores is buying the 24% share held by Dea Spanos Berberian, which includes 9% that is in a family trust that has a 36% stake in the team. He is also purchasing 1% each from shares owned by Dean Spanos, Alexis Spanos Ruhl and Michael Spanos for estate planning purposes.
The transaction ends a bitter three-year fight between Spanos Berberian and her siblings. Spanos Berberian filed a lawsuit against Chargers controlling owner Dean Spanos in 2021 that alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the Spanos Trust and tried to force a sale. 
She filed another lawsuit in 2022 accusing her brother of “misogynistic” behavior, “self-dealing” and repeated “breaches of fiduciary duty.”
As part of the sale, Spanos Berberian has agreed to resolve her disputes with the family and the franchise.
Dean Spanos and Berberian were left as co-trustees of the trust following the deaths of Alex and Faye Spanos in 2018. According to 2021 financial statements that were part of court documents, the trust’s stake in the Chargers makes up 83% of its holdings.


The 60-year-old Gores has a net worth of $11.8 billion, according to Bloomberg. In 1995, he founded Platinum Equity, which has its headquarters in Beverly Hills.
Gores’ purchase comes after NFL owners on Sept. 1 approved allowing private equity funds to buy stakes in teams. However, this is a purchase by Gores and not affiliated with Platinum Equity.
The Chargers’ franchise valuation average is $5.38 billion using this season’s figures from Forbes, Sportico and CNBC. 
Despite having more than a one-quarter stake, Gores will not have a role in the Chargers’ daily business or a path to a controlling stake. The Spanos family owns 69% of the Chargers with 4% controlled by legacy owners from the franchise’s early days in San Diego.
Alex Spanos bought the San Diego Chargers in 1984 and Dean Spanos took over managing the franchise in 1994.
The Chargers moved to Los Angeles in 2017 after years of trying to get a new stadium in San Diego. The franchise carries nearly 14% debt, mostly due to the franchise relocation agreement with the league.

VIENNA (AP) — European far-right and nationalist parties are celebrating the hard-right Freedom Party’s win in Austria’s election. Even though it’s uncertain whether hard-line leader Herbert Kickl will be able to take his vision of a “Fortress Austria” into government, the party’s electoral success could nudge politics further in its direction.
Sunday’s result leaves Austria’s political future uncertain, as it’s questionable how stable the next administration will be — whoever forms it, probably after long negotiations.
The Euroskeptic and pro-Russian Freedom Party won a record 29.2% of the vote, gaining 13 percentage points from the 2019 election. Kickl told cheering supporters that “we wrote Austrian history today.” But Kickl needs a coalition partner to govern, and other parties say they won’t work with him.
Two mainstream parties that governed Austria for most of the time since the end of World War II were hit by voter anger about immigration and inflation and together have such a thin parliamentary majority that they would likely need a third partner to govern.
The Freedom Party is part of a right-wing populist alliance in the European Parliament, Patriots for Europe. Its members welcomed the Austrian result as building on gains in other countries, including in European elections in June.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán hailed “an historic victory” for the Freedom Party. Geert Wilders, whose party dominates the Netherlands’ new government, wrote on social media network X that “We are winning! Times are changing! Identity, sovereignty, freedom and no more illegal immigration/asylum is what tens of millions of Europeans long for!” There were congratulations from French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and others too.
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024
The Freedom Party “will become a role model for Le Pen and others who also want to win elections and claim leadership in their respective countries,” said Paul Schmidt, secretary general of the Austrian Society for European Politics, a think tank. And the stronger the European far-right alliance gets, the more it “will be able to influence priorities on a European level, including on migration, climate and Ukraine,” he said. Schmidt characterized the Freedom Party as more radical than parties such as Le Pen’s National Rally. 


He predicted that mainstream parties in Austria and beyond will borrow topics from the far right even more, which could lead to a further “shift in the public discourse.”
The Freedom Party calls for an end to sanctions against Russia and criticizes Western military aid to Ukraine. Kickl has labeled European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as a “warmonger.” His party also takes a hard-line stance on immigration, calling for “remigration of uninvited foreigners,” and wants to bring back powers from the EU to Austria.
Kickl led the Freedom Party to its best-ever result but could also be its chief impediment to taking power.
The 55-year-old has a taste for provocation and is known for deliberately overstepping accepted boundaries. Last year, for example, he described Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen as a “mummy” and “senile,” shocking the political establishment.
Kickl also has appeared to support conspiracy theories, advocating the use during the COVID-19 pandemic of Ivermectin, a medicine to treat parasitic worms in animals. He has called the World Health Organization “an instrument for enforcement of power interests.”
Even Chancellor Karl Nehammer’s conservative Austrian People’s Party, which has twice led national coalition governments with the Freedom Party and sits with it in some regional governments, considers Kickl a step too far — even a “security risk.” Nehammer says that Kickl “radicalized himself” and it is “impossible to shape a state” with him.
Kickl was a longtime campaign strategist for the Freedom Party, coining catchy and provocative anti-immigration slogans. He spent most of his political career in the background — notably as speechwriter for Jörg Haider, who led the party to success in the 1980s and 1990s — before serving as interior minister between 2017 and 2019 in a government that collapsed because of a corruption scandal surrounding the Freedom Party’s then-leader. He has led the party since 2021.
The Freedom Party, founded in 1956 by former Nazis, is a long-established political force in Austria.
Analysts predict that forming a government will be time-consuming and complicated.
Peter Hajek, an Austrian political analyst, said Kickl could insist on becoming Austria’s next leader — and if that doesn’t happen, as seems likely at present, he will go into opposition and take a comfortable “front-row seat” watching a shaky coalition between the People’s Party and the center-left Social Democrats. 
Those two parties governed post-World War II Austria together for much of the time. But this time they have such a wafer-thin parliamentary majority that they may decide to bring in a third partner, probably the liberal Neos.
While such an alliance would have more seats in parliament, a “three-party coalition is no kindergarten,” Hajek said. That has been an issue in neighboring Germany, where state-level successes for the far-right Alternative for Germany have pushed other parties into uncomfortable, argument-prone alliances in recent years.
The president traditionally functions as a discreet mediator after elections, but it’s unclear what approach Van der Bellen will take. He will swear in the new government after a coalition deal is reached, something for which there is no set deadline. On Sunday night, he said he would ensure that “the fundamental pillars of our liberal democracy will be respected.”

LONDON (AP) — Cole Palmer, Ollie Watkins and Phil Foden have been ruled out of England’s upcoming UEFA Nations League matches against Ireland and Finland.
England plays in Dublin on Saturday before hosting Finland at Wembley three days later as the Euro 2024 runner-up competes under interim manager Lee Carsley for the first time.
England was relegated from the top-tier Nations League group in 2022. It will be the first competitive match between England and Ireland since 1991.
Gareth Southgate stepped down as manager after the European Championship. Carsley has been appointed on a temporary basis.
“The Three Lions squad reported to St. George’s Park on Tuesday but, following assessment, both Palmer and Watkins returned to their clubs to continue rehabilitation for ongoing issues,” the Football Association said in a statement. “Foden did not report through illness and is ruled out of the matches against Republic of Ireland and Finland.”
No additions to the team were planned.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Dylan Raiola threw for 257 yards and a touchdown to lead Nebraska to a 28-10 victory over Purdue in a Big Ten Conference contest Saturday afternoon.
After playing a scoreless first half and trailing 3-0 late in the third quarter, the Cornhuskers scored 28 unanswered points and kept Purdue out of the end zone until the Boilermakers scored in the final 2 minutes.
“They didn’t flinch,” Nebraska coach Matt Rhule said. “To come off the heartbreak of last week when nothing went right (in overtime home loss to Illinois). Glad it ended up 28-10, but it was a game we had to fight for. Guys had to make plays. We had tough calls go against us in the first half and the guys were telling me to keep my composure.”
Nebraska (4-1, 1-1) took the lead at 7-3 on Raiola’s 6-yard touchdown pass to Jahmal Banks with 2:49 remaining in the third quarter.
“Once we got it going, we couldn’t be stopped,” Raiola said.
The Cornhuskers pushed the lead to 14-3 on a fourth-down, 1-yard touchdown by Dante Dowdell with 10:34 left in the fourth quarter.
Nebraska added a 25-yard TD run by Jacory Barney Jr. and John Bullock’s 29-yard interception return for a touchdown.
Purdue (1-3, 0-1) took a 3-0 lead on Spencer Porath’s 45-yard field goal with 6:42 left in third quarter — the Boilermakers’ first field goal of the season.
Each team squandered scoring opportunities in the scoreless first half. Purdue blocked field goals of 44 and 32 yards by Nebraska. The Cornhuskers also missed a 42-yard field goal and the Boilermakers missed a 39-yard field goal. Each team had a touchdown called back for offensive pass interference.


“Everything that could go wrong did in the first half, ” Rhule said.
Purdue quarterback Hudson Card was 18 of 25 passing for 174 yards, including 15-yard touchdown to Leland Smith with 1:29 left. 
“Extremely disappointing and frustrating,” Purdue coach Ryan Walters said. “We do the only thing I know how to do, we go to work and continue to make adjustments. I thought from a defensive perspective, we tweaked a few things and we make some adjustments that I felt helped us.”
The Cornhuskers limited the Boilermakers to 50 rushing yards.
“This gives us that much more confidence in ourselves,” Bullock said. “Just knowing we are still a good team, we just have to play like it. It was a big step up from last week,”
Nebraska: The Cornhuskers finally got the running game in gear in the second half, finishing with 161 yards. Nebraska had its share of miscues with two blocked fields and 11 penalties, for 94 yards including an unsportsmanlike conduct call on Cornhuskers coach Matt Rhule. Rhule said he threw his headset, but thought he was OK where he threw it on the sideline.
Purdue: The Boilermakers, who lost their third consecutive game, were hampered by 13 penalties for 165 yards, including six flags for pass interference. “I thought a couple (pass interference calls) were blatant and a couple that were judgement calls,” Purdue coach Ryan Walters said. “I’ll look at tape and see where we can improve on that one. The one drives you crazy is the pre- and post-snap penalties, stepping over the receiver (for taunting) is stupid. It can’t happen..”
Nebraska senior linebacker John Bullock finally got his first touchdown with 29-yard interception return.
“The last time in a game I had the ball in my hands was probably high school,” Bullock said. “To have the ball in my hands was incredible. I hope I can have more of, but that was more the coaches than me. They told me to play that route in cover 2 and I took it to the house. After that, I just went numb. I didn’t know what to feel.”
Nebraska: Hosts Rutgers next Saturday
Purdue: At Wisconsin next Saturday.

Publication date:2024-09-04 07:00:00

NEW YORK (AP) — “Very demure, very mindful” has become the latest vocabulary defining the internet’s summer. And TikTok creator Jools Lebron is working to trademark uses of her now-viral words.
Lebron filed to trademark “very demure very mindful” for various entertainment and advertising services, including the promotion of beauty products, last week with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Two filings dated Thursday are under her legal name, a representative for Lebron confirmed to The Associated Press.
Social media’s love for “very demure” content started in early August, when Lebron took to TikTok to describe the hair and makeup she was wearing to work. Her delivery took off and she kept going, with “mindful” and “cutesy” flooding the internet as scores of fans, including big name celebrities, shared their own playful takes to describe just about any detail of day-to-day life.
Content creators can make meaningful income after gaining social media fame through avenues like direct brand sponsorships and viewer donations. And for Lebron, who is a transgender woman, her viral moment allowed her to finance the rest of her transition.
Trademarks, on the other hand, can help secure rights to maintain certain business down the road. Lebron’s own trademark filings are still pending, and it could be a while before there’s a final determination. But the move is particularly notable after several other individuals with no known connection to Lebron separately tried to register demure-related trademarks in an apparent effort to capitalize on the success of those phrases, much to the dismay of Lebron’s fans.


The saga, while unfinished, has spotlighted the complex process of filing trademarks that capture a viral moment — and the battle that social media content creators face to both get credit and find protections to monetize off the trends they popularize. 
Here’s what you should know.
Yes. But in the U.S., there needs to be an attached commercial use.
“It’s not just coming up with a phrase ... (or) using it on social media and making it go viral,” said Alexandra J. Roberts, a professor of law and media at Northeastern University, explaining that there must be a connection to the sale of concrete goods or services. She calls trademarks a “source indicator,” as they help consumers understand who is producing what they’re buying now, but not necessarily who came up with a name in the first place.
The law is complicated, and trademarks are often determined on a case-by-case basis. Applications are specific to certain uses, allowing multiple brands to operate under similar names — like Dove chocolate and Dove soap, or Delta Faucet and Delta Airlines. Courts greenlight this when it’s assumed that consumers will easily be able to distinguish between such different products or services.
But a phrase or name that’s strongly associated with a particular individual can sometimes supersede that. 
“Simplistically, the entire reason the trademark exists is to prevent consumer confusion,” said Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of information science at the University of Colorado Boulder. “And if (someone else) created a social media marketing service and called it ‘very demure, very mindful social media marketing,’ that would confuse consumers because they’re gonna think it’s associated with (Jools Lebron).”
Trademarks should not be mixed up with copyright. Anyone who has ever made a unique TikTok, for example, owns the copyright to that video, Fiesler explains. But there are still limitations to what’s copyrightable, and short phrases themselves almost never apply.
In today’s ever-digitized world of online trends, creators are increasingly expressing concerns about getting credited for their work. And for something like trademark rights, experts stress it’s a battle of both getting there first and having resources to see it through.
It’s not uncommon to see a handful of trademark applications bubble up in the midst of a viral moment. Earlier this year, for example, a handful of trademark applications were filed after Hailey Welch, also now known as “Hawk Tuah Girl,” became famous for using the phrase in a street interview.
Still, some phrases have been determined to be used too pervasively, making it harder for consumers to recognize it as a brand indicator. It can also be difficult when credit isn’t given to the creator who starts a trend in the first place — and experts note the consequences of that haven’t been felt equally in the past.
Historically, young women of color who start a viral trend or put a new phrase on the map have often seen their work get appropriated online — and potentially “get scooped” on trademark rights from someone with more resources, like connections to a lawyer, Roberts explained.
“There are a lot of stories of members of minoritized groups, and particularly women, coming up with new slang ... and then seeing that get co-opted by somebody else — often a white guy, but not always ... (who) gets out there as the first to register and really make money off it,” Roberts said.
Beyond trademark-specific disputes, Fiesler added that creators seeing their work stolen and reposted in other platforms for monetization continues to be a “huge problem” today, but she hopes the tide is starting to turn. That includes with Lebron, who has been so widely-credited for the “very demure” trend.
“I hope to continue to see there being very strong social norms that are enforcing this,” Fiesler said. 
Three applications that were submitted before Lebron’s Thursday filings are still listed as live in the USPTO’s records — which would essentially make her “fourth in line” in consideration, Roberts said. 
But it’s possible that others might later suspend their filings. And one of the applicants told NBC said that she filed in efforts to help Lebron hold on to trademark until she could transfer it.
Lebron’s legal team could potentially fight off rival filings or strengthen her own by negotiating with other applicants and updating her filing to reduce any overlap. She could also oppose a rival application down the road on the grounds of false association.
The trademark process could outlast the trend itself, taking anywhere between six to nine months, and sometimes closer to a year. And that can drag out even further with a legal battle or requested extensions.
Still, Roberts stresses that Lebron can currently “do whatever she wants in terms of use” and start selling merchandise. 
There’s also nothing stopping someone from putting “very demure, very mindful” on the front of a t-shirt — as that technically qualifies as ornamental use, not trademark. 
But getting those words as a brand, seen on something like an attached clothing tag, is when trademark rights would kick in.",False

CLEVELAND (AP) — The Browns changed the name of their lakefront stadium while they consider changing addresses.
As they position themselves to build a possible new domed stadium, the Browns announced a 20-year partnership on Tuesday with Huntington National Bank, which bought exclusive naming rights.
Huntington Bank Field will host its first game Sunday as Cleveland kicks off the 2024 season against the Dallas Cowboys.
Financial terms of the deal were not immediately known. What is clear is that whether the NFL team renovates its current stadium or builds a proposed $2.4 billion dome in the suburbs, the name will stay the same.
“This is with the Cleveland Browns,” Huntington CEO Steve Steinour said. “So wherever the Cleveland Browns play, we are going to be there in a big way. That’s either here or a new stadium.”
The Browns’ lease at their stadium expires after the 2028 season.
The team has discussed overhauling the property with a $1.1 billion renovation, which is preferred by the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County. The Browns seem determined to build a dome and entertainment complex in Brook Park, Ohio — about 12 miles south.
The team would like to fund the project with a private/public partnership, but have been met with some resistance.
With the sides currently at an impasse, owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam didn’t want the stadium battle to tarnish the agreement with Huntington.


“We’ve been very explicit that this is complex, it’s complicated, it’s going to take some time, and so at the appropriate time, we’ll address that,” Jimmy Haslam said when asked for a timetable on a decision being reached. “That’s not today.”

Huntington, which is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, will become the team’s official and exclusive banking partner.
The Haslams also own the MLS Columbus Crew, and it was during the recent All-Star weekend at their stadium when discussions began with Huntington about a partnership.
The Browns’ 65,000-seat lakefront stadium had been known as Cleveland Browns Stadium after an agreement with FirstEnergy Corp. ended in 2023. FirstEnergy’s partnership with the team came under scrutiny after the utility company admitted to paying bribes to Ohio lawmakers.
The Haslams, who have owned the Browns since 2012, feel a new stadium and entertainment complex could lure major events like a Super Bowl, Final Fours and music acts to the city, triggering development and economic growth.
County officials pushed back at those plans, arguing that moving the Browns would have a detrimental impact on downtown. The city has offered to pay $461 million toward renovating the current stadium, which opened in 1999 when Cleveland returned to the league as an expansion franchise.
Huntington also has naming rights in Columbus to Huntington Park, home of the Clippers, the Triple-A affiliate of the Cleveland Guardians. The bank also has its name on the University of Minnesota’s football stadium.

Israeli airstrikes across Gaza killed dozens more Palestinians on Wednesday, according to local officials. They said strikes on a U.N. school being used as a shelter and two homes killed at least 34 people, including 19 women and children.
The Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the Israel-Hamas war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, often multiple times.
Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their Oct. 7 attack that sparked the war. They abducted another 250 and are still holding around 100. Around a third of them are believed to be dead.
Here’s the latest:
AMMAN, Jordan — An Islamic party affiliated with the regional Muslim Brotherhood movement has emerged as the largest party in Jordan’s parliament after tapping into public anger over Israel’s war against Hamas.
The Islamic Action Front captured 31 seats in this week’s Jordanian parliamentary election, the country’s election commission announced Wednesday. The IAF had just eight seats in the previous parliament.
Although it is the largest single party, it fell far short of a majority in the 138-seat parliament. 
The Islamic Action Front has organized hundreds of pro-Hamas demonstrations across Jordan and used a green triangle often associated with Hamas during its election campaign. In another sign of possible discontent, official state-run media said turnout for the election was just 32%.


Jordan is home to a large Palestinian population. Although the kingdom is a strong U.S. ally and maintains diplomatic relations with Israel, the general public is widely sympathetic to the Palestinians.
Parliamentary elections are seen as a reflection of public opinion in Jordan, where governing powers are concentrated in the hands of King Abdullah II.
UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations is condemning the Israeli airstrike on a U.N. school being used as a shelter in Gaza and trying to confirm reports that some U.N. staff members were killed in the attack.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Wednesday that it was the fifth airstrike on the same school in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza since Israel retaliated for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.
“We condemn all airstrikes that target civilians and those that also target U.N. facilities,” Dujarric said.
According to hospital officials, the Israeli airstrike Wednesday killed at least 14 people, including two children, when it hit the school run by the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA now being used to shelter Palestinian families.
“Our policy is clear. U.N. premises should never be targeted, nor should U.N. premises be used by any groups or any force from which to launch military activities,” he said. “U.N. premises need to be protected. U.N. premises need to be respected, and that is by all parties to any conflict.”
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will beef up security along the West Bank’s border with Jordan after a deadly attack this week.
Three Israeli civilians were killed Sunday when a Jordanian truck driver who had entered the West Bank through a major crossing opened fire.
Visiting on Wednesday, Netanyahu called the area a “border of peace” and said Israel was cooperating with Jordan to maintain quiet.
Netanyahu says militants have stepped up efforts to smuggle weapons from Jordan into the occupied territory, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
“We will work here to construct a stronger barrier against smuggling attempts,” he said, saying all work will be coordinated with Jordan.
Israel and Jordan signed a peace agreement 30 years ago. The countries maintain good security ties, though diplomatic relations have been strained by Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas.
An Israeli airstrike killed at least 14 people, including two children, when it hit a U.N. school sheltering displaced Palestinian families in central Gaza on Wednesday, hospital officials said.
The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas militants planning attacks from inside the school, located in the Nuseirat refugee camp. The claim could not be independently confirmed.
Officials from Awda Hospital in Nuseirat said they had received 10 dead from the strike, and another four dead were brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah. At least one woman and two children were among those killed, and at least 18 people were wounded, hospital officials said.
One of the children was the daughter of Momin Selmi, a member of Gaza’s civil defense agency, which works rescuing wounded and bodies after strikes, the agency said in a statement. Selmi hadn’t seen his daughter for 10 months, since he remained in north Gaza to keep working while his family fled south, the agency said.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes by Israeli offensives and evacuation orders are living in Gaza’s schools.
The school hit Thursday — called the al-Jaouni Boys Preparatory School, one of the many in Gaza run by the U.N. agency for Palestinians UNWRA — has been hit by multiple strikes over the course of the war.
Israel frequently bombs schools, saying they are being used by Hamas militants. It blames Hamas for civilian casualties from its strikes, saying its fighters base themselves and operate among civilians.
More than 90% of Gaza’s school buildings have been severely or partially damaged in strikes, and more than half the schools housing displaced people have been hit, according to a survey in July by the Education Cluster, a collection of aid groups led by UNICEF and Save the Children.
Israel’s 11-month-old campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,084 Palestinians and wounded another 95,029, the territory’s Health Ministry said Wednesday. Israel launched its campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others.
The Israeli military says the attacker who crashed his fuel truck in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Wednesday was intentionally targeting Israeli forces.
The attack, in which the driver rammed the truck into a bus stop in central West Bank, left one man in critical condition. Israeli officials said that soldiers and an armed civilian had “neutralized” the attacker, but it was not immediately clear whether that meant he had been killed.
It appeared the attacker was a Palestinian Israeli. The military said his home had been identified in southern Israel ahead of “potential demolition.”
Israel frequently demolishes homes of Palestinians suspected of carrying out attacks against Israelis, a tactic Palestinians decry as collective punishment.
BELGRADE, Serbia – Israel’s President Isaac Herzog said that “this has been a very painful and difficult morning for the people of Israel” because of an attack in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and a helicopter crash in Gaza.
Speaking in Serbia’s capital, Belgrade, Herzog described Wednesday’s attack as a “horrific, criminal terror attack” and expressed “sorrow for the pain it has inflicted.” He did not elaborate but was apparently referring to the incident when a fuel tanker crashed into a West Bank bus stop, seriously injuring one person. Israeli officials said it was an attack.
The Israeli military said the driver was “neutralized” at the scene. It did not immediately identify the driver or provide evidence that the crash was an attack. Violence in the West Bank has escalated since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza.
Herzog also said at a joint news conference with Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic that “my heart also goes out to the fighters who were killed last night in a helicopter crash in Gaza and I wish those wounded a full and swift recovery.”
The Israeli military said that two Israeli soldiers died and seven were injured when their helicopter crashed in the southern Gaza Strip overnight in a non-combat-related incident. 
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden says he is “outraged and deeply saddened” by the death of an American activist who was shot by Israeli forces while protesting settlements in the occupied West Bank, calling it “totally unacceptable.”
“There must be full accountability,” Biden said in a statement released early on Wednesday. “And Israel must do more to ensure that incidents like this never happen again.”
The Israeli military said on Tuesday that Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old activist from Seattle, was likely shot “indirectly and unintentionally” by its soldiers, and that it had launched a criminal investigation.
That drew a strong rebuke from her family members, who said in a statement that they were “deeply offended by the suggestion that her killing by a trained sniper was in any way unintentional.” They said “the disregard shown for human life in the inquiry is appalling.”
During Friday’s demonstration, clashes broke out between Palestinians throwing stones and Israeli troops firing tear gas and ammunition, according to Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli protester who was there. He said the violence had subsided about a half hour before Eygi was shot.
The military said its forces appear to have aimed at the “key instigator of the riot” and hit Eygi by mistake. Eygi also had Turkish citizenship. 
A statement by Vice President Kamala Harris followed shortly after Biden’s, with Harris saying that the U.S. will “continue to hold accountable anyone in the West Bank — Israelis and Palestinians — who stokes violence and undermines peace and stability.”
JERUSALEM — A fuel tanker crashed into a bus stop in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, seriously injuring one person in what Israeli officials said was an attack.
The Israeli military said the driver was “neutralized” at the scene after the incident on Wednesday. It did not immediately identify the driver or provide evidence that the crash was an attack.
The Magen David Adom rescue service said it was treating the man who was injured, saying he is in critical condition.
Palestinians have carried out a number of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years. The army carries out near-daily raids into Palestinian communities in the West Bank that it says are aimed at dismantling militant groups and preventing attacks.
The violence has escalated since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza.
RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank says an ongoing polio vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip has reached 82.5% of targeted children.
The ministry said on Wednesday that 527,776 children under the age of 10 have received the first dose of the vaccine across the war-ravaged enclave.
The campaign began earlier this month after the detection of the first confirmed polio case in Gaza in 25 years. It aims at vaccinating about 640,000 children there.
Israel agreed to limited humanitarian pauses to facilitate the campaign, according to the World Health Organization, and there have been no major disruptions from the ongoing war.
The Palestinian Health Ministry in the Israeli-occupied West Bank is part of the Palestinian Authority, whose forces were driven out of Gaza when Hamas seized power there in 2007 and set up its own government.
The two Palestinian health ministries coordinate with one another and exchange information.
TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military says two Israeli soldiers died and seven were injured when their helicopter crashed in the southern Gaza Strip. 
The military said Wednesday that the overnight helicopter crash was not the result of enemy fire and is under investigation. The helicopter was on a mission to evacuate wounded soldiers from Gaza for treatment in Israeli hospitals.
There have been 340 Israeli soldiers killed since the ground operation began in Gaza in late October, at least 50 of whom have been killed in accidents within Gaza — not as a result of combat with Palestinian militants, according to the military.
JERUSALEM — An Israeli official says dozens of Palestinian patients were expected to leave the Gaza Strip on Wednesday by way of an Israeli crossing, in order to travel to the United Arab Emirates for medical care.
The official says over 200 people, mostly children, are expected to leave, along with relatives to accompany them. It is the biggest exit of medical patients through Israel since the war erupted nearly a year ago.
Gaza has been completely sealed off since May, when Israeli forces captured the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, including the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the coastal strip, leading to its closure. Rafah had been the only entry or exit point for Palestinians, including medical patients, since the start of the war.
Since then, Israel has only allowed a small number of children and accompanying relatives to leave for medical treatment.
Israel’s military offensive, launched in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, has gutted Gaza’s already fragile health system. With few exceptions, Israel has barred Gaza’s Palestinians from entering Israel throughout the war.
The official says the patients are leaving through the Kerem Shalom crossing and heading to the Ramon airport in southern Israel, where they will board a flight to the UAE.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement by Israeli authorities.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Hamas released the first public statement from Yahya Sinwar since he was appointed its overall leader in August.
In the written statement late Tuesday, Sinwar congratulated Algeria’s President Abdelmadjid Tebboune on his reelection and thanked the country for its support for the Palestinian cause. Algeria, the Arab representative on the United Nations Security Council, circulated a draft resolution in May demanding an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and a halt to Israel’s military operation in the southern city of Rafah.
A hard-liner within Hamas, Sinwar would have to approve any potential agreement for a cease-fire and hostage release. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent most of the year trying to broker such a deal but the negotiations have repeatedly stalled.
Sinwar was one of the architects of the Oct. 7 attack into Israel that ignited the war in Gaza. He has not been seen since the start of the war and is believed to be alive and hiding inside the territory. Israel has vowed to kill him.
RAMALLAH, West Bank — An Israeli airstrike has killed five Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials say. 
The Israeli military said it targeted a group of militants in the northern city of Tubas early Wednesday.
The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank confirmed the toll but does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are militants or civilians.
Israel has stepped up its military raids across the territory in recent weeks and says it is working to dismantle militant groups and prevent attacks. Palestinians say such operations are aimed at cementing Israel’s seemingly open-ended military rule over the territory.
Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there.
DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have killed at least 20 people, including 16 women and children.
An airstrike early Wednesday killed 11 people, including six siblings ranging from 21 months to 21 years old, according to the European Hospital, which received the casualties. The dead from the strike near the southern city of Khan Younis included three other women, a child and a man, according to the hospital.
A strike late Tuesday on a home in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza killed nine people, including six women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Civil Defense first responders. The Civil Defense says the home belonged to Akram al-Najjar, a professor at the al-Quds Open University, who survived the strike.
Israel says it only targets militants, claiming 17,000 militant deaths without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters are embedded in dense residential neighborhoods. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.",False

DALLAS (AP) — Kevin Jennings passed for a career-high three touchdowns and Kobe Wilson returned one of three SMU interceptions 82 yards for a score as the Mustangs beat Florida State 42-16 on Saturday night before a sellout crowd in their ACC debut.
Jennings threw TD passes of 11 and 15 yards to RJ Maryland and a flea-flicker score of 42 yards to Jordan Hudson.
“It means a lot to come in and get a ‘W’ against any team,” Jennings said, “but for the ACC (opener), it’s a home game and a jam-packed stadium, it means a lot to the city of the Dallas.”
Former President George W. Bush, a Dallas resident, performed the pregame coin toss.
Jennings was 16-for-23 passing for a career-best 254 yards. On the flea flicker, Roderick Daniels Jr. immediately turned and flipped the ball back to Jennings. He lofted a pass down the middle to Hudson, who was backpedaling at 10 and eased into the end zone.
Wilson made the interception between the hash marks, raced to the right sideline, and broke a tackle near midfield and hurdled a teammate while escorted to the end zone.
“I just saw green grass and then I saw a couple people coming at me, so I got scared,” Wilson said. “I thought I was going to go down, but I ended up in the end zone. It was like the blink of an eye.”
Brashard Smith and Roderick Daniels Jr. scored rushing touchdowns for the Mustangs (4-1, 1-0) from 13 and 2 yards, respectively. Daniels’ score ended a drive that was continued when FSU’s Omarion Cooper was called for a facemask penalty on the Mustangs’ punt from their 26-yard line.


Smith, a transfer this year from Miami, led SMU with a season-high 129 yards rushing despite sitting out most of the second quarter with an injury.
The Mustangs’ 467 total yards were the most gained this season on the defending conference champions.
DJ Uiagalelei was 12-for-30 passing for 222 yards, three interceptions, and TD passes of 9 yards to Kentron Poitier and 20 yards to Landen Thomas for Florida State (1-4, 1-3). Uiagalelei was replaced by Brock Glenn in the final minutes.
The Seminoles also scored on a safety in the half’s closing seconds when, forcing a punt from SMU’s 9, long snapper Will Benton IV sailed the ball over the head of Isaac Pearson and beyond the end zone.
Florida State has lost at least three of its first four games for the third time in coach Mike Norvell’s five seasons.
Florida State continues to struggle on the ground. The Seminoles went into play averaging 67.75 rushing yards per game, the fourth fewest among FBS teams. They gained 75 on 26 attempts, averaging 2.9 yards per carry, and were led by Lawrence Toafili with 67 yards.
SMU leads FBS with five non-offensive touchdowns this season – two interception returns, two fumble returns and one punt return.
Florida State will host Clemson, where Uiagalelei played his first three collegiate seasons before spending 2023 at Oregon State, on Oct. 5.
SMU will play the first of three consecutive ACC road games against Louisville on Oct. 5.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, stirring security concerns in the region already tense over Beijing’s territorial claims and rivalry with the U.S.
The ICBM carried a dummy warhead and fell into a designated area of the sea, the Defense Ministry said in a statement posted to social media.
The launch by the People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force was part of routine annual training, complied with international law and was not directed against any country or target, according to the statement.
It is unclear how often China conducts tests over such a distance. In 1980, China launched an ICBM into the South Pacific.
A map published in Chinese newspapers at the time showed the target area as roughly a circle in the center of a ring formed by the Solomon Islands, Nauru, the Gilbert Islands, Tuvalu, western Samoa, Fiji and the New Hebrides.
The U.S. and non-governmental organizations have said China has been building up its missile silos, but it’s unclear how many missiles and nuclear warheads it has added to its arsenal.
The People’s Liberation Army, which functions as the ruling Communist Party’s military wing, runs China’s space program, which has established an orbital station and has ambitions to set up a Moon base and land a spacecraft on Mars.
Rocketry has long been part of China’s development into a major global power, spurring nationalism and growth that has made China the world’s second-largest economy.


The U.S. remains China’s main global rival, although Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and others have territorial disputes with Beijing that occasionally threaten to develop into military clashes.
China maintains a “no first use” of nuclear weapons policy, even as its desire for regional predominance grows.
Tests of China’s intercontinental ballistic missiles into international waters are rare. Experts and a historical survey of China’s program by the Washington-based Nuclear Threat Initiative suggest the last occurred in May 1980. That test saw China launch its DF-5 missile into the South Pacific.
China typically launches missiles toward its western deserts from its east coast, said James Acton, the co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The fact that China launched a test that splashed down in international waters was unusual, but mirrors testing that the United States does for its own ballistic missile fleet.
“When they haven’t done something for 44 years and then they do it, that’s significant,” Acton told The Associated Press. “It’s China’s way of telling us, ‘Like you, we’re not ashamed we have nuclear weapons and we’re going to behave like a great nuclear power.’”
The launch came amid the ongoing United Nations General Assembly in New York. China is one of five veto-holding permanent members of the U.N.'s Security Council and has sought to gain influence over its key departments involving human rights and that align with its authoritarian system.
A series of corruption arrests this year ensnared several leading officers in the Rocket Force, alongside the detentions of two previous defense ministers amid allegations of misconduct.
A test launch now could both provide assurances to China’s population amid an economic downtown and a signal to the world that the party remains firmly in control and is determined to rise to global prominence.
“We’re entering a new age. We’re entering an age where the U.S. and China are engulfed in what feels like an arms race,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in the U.S.
“The Chinese government always prioritized diplomatic issues over operational readiness. It’s just a different China. It’s a China that does not feel constrained,” he said.
“There’s a renewed emphasis on assuring themselves these systems work and demonstrating to others they work,” Lewis added.
Meanwhile, tensions remain high over Taiwan, and with the Philippines, where the U.S. Army has deployed its new mid-range missile system, known as Typhon, to Northern Luzon. On Wednesday, two Filipino officials said the U.S. and the Philippines have agreed to keep the system there indefinitely to deter China.
“I don’t know what’s the plan, but if I were to be followed, if I were given the choice, I would like to have the Typhon here in the Philippines forever because we need it for our defense,” said Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., the head of the Philippines’ military. 
Defense officials in Japan and Taiwan declined to comment directly on the Chinese announcement. Both, along with South Korea, maintain robust defenses against Chinese moves, including early warning systems and air raid shelters.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana Fever coach Christie Sides slept through her team’s historic playoff-clinching moment Tuesday night. Rookie guard Caitlin Clark watched the decisive game, then went to bed.
For the WNBA’s top-drawing team, the end to a seven-year playoff drought on a night it didn’t play seemed a little, well, unceremonious.
On Wednesday morning, the Fever’s world changed. The team that endured seven straight losing seasons, had won only 30 games over the previous four years and started this season 1-8 was the toast of Indianapolis.
“I usually go to bed by 9:30, 10 o’clock every night, but I did set my alarm for midnight to wake up and I actually just turned it off. Didn’t even look,” Sides said. “So this morning, I woke up to some really awesome text messages.”
Losses by Chicago and Atlanta gave the Fever their first postseason berth since Tamika Catchings retired in 2016, even if Sides wanted just one of those teams to win so the Fever could clinch it on their home court in front of another near-capacity crowd.
Still, nobody was all that upset, and the fans still had plenty to celebrate Wednesday night when Indiana beat Los Angeles 93-86 behind a triple-double from Clark, who also became the fastest player in WNBA history to reach 100 3-pointers in a season (she now has 102).
During pregame warmups, beaming smiles could be found on faces all around — Clark, the former Iowa star who has taken women’s basketball to unprecedented heights; Kelsey Mitchell, the seven-year veteran who will finally get her first taste of playoff basketball; and especially Sides, who on Wednesday was named WNBA coach of the month, a first for the Fever.


While this was the goal from the moment Indiana drafted Clark with the No. 1 overall in pick, it was never a gimme.
“Definitely, cool,” said Clark, who swept the league’s monthly honors for player and rookie of the month. “It doesn’t even have to come down to the wire for us, and I think that’s special. Like you can just relax and play basketball and have a lot of fun. Yeah, we accomplished that, but there’s still so much more left on the table.”
It’s not just Clark who realizes what’s possible.
Guard Erica Wheeler appeared in four playoff games during her first two WNBA seasons and it took her eight more to make it back. It’s been so long, the playoff format has changed, as has her role — playing behind Clark.
But as one of four Fever players with postseason experience, she can bring some important perspective. 
“The job is not done,” Wheeler said. “We still have six, seven more games and we can’t think ahead like that. Me being a vet, I know that for a fact. So for me, it’s not time to think about the playoffs. You’ve got seven games left.”
Just three months ago, the postseason appeared unlikely.
A brutal early schedule coupled with Clark starting her pro career just five weeks after completing a 39-game college schedule contributed to Indiana’s early woes. The Olympic break gave Clark a much-needed breather and a young team time to figure out how to jell.
Since June 1, Indiana is 17-8 and has victories over each of the league’s top three teams — New York, Minnesota and Connecticut — along with a three-game season sweep of Phoenix, all while stopping the league’s longest streak of consecutive games played with a losing record at 189.
“We were able to keep it together and they focused on the things we kept talking about — creating good habits, relentless effort, togetherness and toughness,” Sides said. “We focused on those things and that’s what mattered.”
Having Clark didn’t hurt, either.
Clark continues to be the league’s feature attraction, routinely drawing sellout crowds and large national television audiences. Business Insider recently reported that this year’s secondary-market ticket prices had nearly doubled year over year — before the Olympic break.
Indiana also leads the league in home, road and overall attendance, and the Fever have appeared on each of the 13 highest-rated telecasts this year. It’s easy to imagine big audiences should Clark face record-setting rookie Angel Reese of Chicago, established stars Diana Taurasi and Brittney Griner of Phoenix or Sabrina Ionescu and Breanna Stewart of New York in a playoff series.
Indiana is a league-best 9-2 in its last 11 games. And with five more home games and a regular-season finale at Washington, the Fever could cause the WNBA’s top teams some restless nights.
“It’s definitely a big moment for this place, but at the same time, I came in with the expectation this was going to happen,” Clark said. “For me, this isn’t a party. It’s great, I feel like it’s a great accomplishment, but there’s much more left to be done. Yeah, we made the playoffs, but I’m not just happy to be in the playoffs. I think we have the kind of team that can and advance going one game at a time.”

Publication date:2024-09-29 01:06:00

MONTREAL (AP) — Patrick Cantlay couldn’t have hit the putt — he might not have seen the hole — without lights from a video board and the headlamps from golf carts surrounding the 18th green in the final match of the longest day at the Presidents Cup.
And then he delivered another “Patty Ice” moment that might have been enough to turn the lights out on the International team Saturday.
Scottie Scheffler delivered big moments late in both of his matches, and Cantlay’s putt from just inside 17 feet in the dark gave the Americans another win, another point, moving them one session closer to another Presidents Cup victory.
“Huge putt,” U.S. captain Jim Furyk said. “If you had to hand select someone to hit a big putt on your team, I think Pat would come to a lot of people’s minds.”
They won the fourballs and foursomes sessions by a 3-1 margin. Cantlay and Xander Schauffele won on the 18th over Tom Kim and Si Wood Kim, the high-charged South Korean duo, that gave the Americans an 11-7 lead at Royal Montreal.
“Xander helped me read it,” Cantlay said of his match winner in near darkness. “It was like a cup out with some speed, and a putt like that will make me sleep a little better tonight.”
It was Si Woo Kim who chipped in from deep rough below the 16th green that gave his side hope, and he leaned his cheek into his hands the “Good Night” gesture made famous from Stephen Curry in the Paris Olympics this summer.


That turned out to be an early call.
Tom Kim said he could hear some American players cursing at them, though it wasn’t corroborated and Schauffele said he didn’t know to what the 22-year-old was referring. Most of the matches have been tight all week. The crowd has been loud. It has gotten chippy at times, expected in these team competitions.
What hasn’t changed is the Internationals face a big deficit.
They need to win eight of the 12 singles matches Sunday for a tie, and halve another if they want to win for the first time since 1998 — four years before Tom Kim was born — and only the second time since the Presidents Cup began in 1994.
International captain Mike Weir sat out four players all of Saturday, wanting to ride the teams that helped get his side back into the match with that 5-0 shutout on Friday.
One of them was Jason Day, who will be first out Sunday against Schauffele.
It’s the same deficit from two years ago, and Weir recalls the Internationals — a team facing distractions in 2022 of losing players who defected to Saudi-backed LIV Golf — making the Quail Hollow crowd quiet and the Americans sweat.
“We just have tremendous belief in our guys,” Weir said. “Might feel similar to what it was in Charlotte, but I’m just telling you, maybe there’s an upgrade in belief for our team.”
Tom Kim sounded even more determined, bordering on angry.
“I am so motivated to go out tomorrow ... because we’ve lost so many times, there’s going to be one day where it’s just going to be our day,” he said. “I believe it’s tomorrow.
“If we fall short, we’ll try again. That’s what we are. We’ll keep trying. There’s going to be one time when we’re going to hold the Cup, and it’s going to be sometime soon.”
Scheffler finished off a tight fourballs match with two late birdies in a morning session delayed 90 minutes by fog, and then he gave the Americans their first lead in foursomes with a wedge into a foot on the 14th hole that led to another point.
Scheffler started both matches slowly. Collin Morikawa kept them in the game in fourballs until Scheffler hit a dart from 195 yards to 8 feet for birdie on the 16th, and rolled in a 15-foot putt from off the green on the 17th for the win.
Russell Henley carried him in foursomes, especially after Scheffler missed par putts from 6 feet and 3 feet as they fell 3 down after five holes. But the world’s No. 1 player delivered late with a wedge into a foot on the 14th for their first lead and a 12-foot birdie on the next to take control.
“I have the best player in the world on my team, and we just kind of hung in there,” Henley said.
Adam Scott, playing in his 11th Presidents Cup without ever being on the winning side, carried Taylor Pendrith to a 2-and-1 victory in the afternoon foursomes over Brian Harman and Max Homa, the only International point in foursomes.
Si Woo Kim and Tom Kim won big over Keegan Bradley and Wyndham Clark in morning fourballs for the lone International victory.
They were all square or leading in all the afternoon matches at one point until the Americans took control, as they often do. Morikawa and Burns dug out of an early hole and beat the Canadian duo of Corey Conners and Mackenzie Hughes on the 18th hole when when Hughes hit a poor chip and Conners never came close on the 12-foot par putt.
In the anchor match in the morning, Im three times matched birdies against Cantlay and Burns to keep the match from getting out of hand. Cantlay chipped in for eagle on the 12th for a 2-up lead and he twice kept the Internationals from coming back by making putts from 25 feet and 18 feet when they were in tight.
“The guy’s an absolute assassin,” Burns said about Cantlay.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Cody Bellinger tripled, singled twice and drove in four runs, and the Chicago Cubs routed the Philadelphia Phillies 10-4 on Tuesday night.
Kyle Schwarber hit his 38th homer of the season and Bryce Harper hit his 30th for the Phillies, who clinched their first NL East title in 13 years on Monday night. Manager Rob Thomson played his regular lineup, minus catcher J.T. Realmuto, as Philadelphia seeks to secure home-field advantage in the National League playoffs.
“You obviously want to go out there and keep winning. It didn’t work out for us,” Schwarber said. “You tip your hat. The biggest thing is to put this behind us and focus on the next four games.”
The Phillies (93-65) have four games remaining and need to finish at least tied with the Brewers to get a first-round playoff bye. Milwaukee beat Pittsburgh on Tuesday night to move within 2 1/2 games of the Phillies.
“We want to keep pushing and winning baseball games,” Schwarber said.
Philadelphia can also clinch home field through the NL Championship Series by ending the season tied with or ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who entered Tuesday night at 93-63.
After Harper put the Phillies up 1-0 in the first by reaching 30 home runs for the fifth time in his career, Philadelphia dug a huge hole in the second, when Tanner Banks (2-3) and Taijuan Walker combined to give up six runs.
“We had a really good inning,” Cubs manager Craig Counsell said.


Walker, who signed a four-year, $72 million free-agent deal prior to the 2023 season, entered with the bases loaded and one out and was booed loudly, especially after issuing consecutive bases-loaded walks. The displeasure from Phillies fans got even louder when Seiya Suzuki hit a two-run single.
The Phillies will not need a No. 5 starter the rest of the way. It was a weak spot for most of the season, especially in the second half.
Philadelphia got a run back in the bottom of the inning on Garrett Stubbs’ RBI bunt single. Stubbs leaped over Bellinger with a headfirst slide into first base.
The Cubs blew the game open in the sixth with four more runs, highlighted by Bellinger’s bases-clearing triple to right field.
“All night we had runners on base,” Counsell said.
Drew Smyly (4-8) pitched a scoreless inning in relief of Cubs starter Justin Steele, who allowed two runs in four innings.
“All around good,” Counsell said of the Cubs’ pitchers. 
Dansby Swanson doubled twice for Chicago, and Pete Crow-Armstrong had three hits.
Schwarber went deep in the eighth, a two-run shot.
Cubs: 1B Michael Busch (right triceps contusion) did not come out to play the field in the bottom of the second after being hit by a pitch in the top of the frame. ... Suzuki didn’t bat in the eighth after spraining his ankle running the bases. 
Phillies: LF Austin Hays returned to the lineup after being sidelined since Sept. 1 with a kidney infection. Hays went 1 for 4.
The teams wrap up their three-game series on Wednesday night when Cubs RHP Javier Assad (7-5, 3.34 ERA) faces Phillies LHP Cristopher Sánchez (11-9, 3.25).

PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona Diamondbacks placed starting pitcher Ryne Nelson on the 15-day injured list with right shoulder inflammation.
Nelson’s injury is a blow to a team that’s in a tight battle for one of the National League wild card spots. The right-hander has been arguably the D-backs’ best pitcher over the past few months and has a 10-6 record with a 4.33 ERA. 
The move is retroactive to Sept. 11, which means Nelson could return before the end of the regular season. Arizona called up left-hander Brandon Hughes to take Nelson’s spot on the roster.
The Diamondbacks also announced that catcher Andrew Knizner was designated for assignment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Johnny Cash now stands among the most famous politicians, trailblazers and activists of American history as he became the first professional musician to be honored with a statue in the U.S. Capitol.
Congressional leaders from both parties and members of the Cash family were among the several hundred guests who gathered Tuesday for the unveiling of the statue. They shared their memories of a man who grew up on an Arkansas cotton farm and turned a love of music into a decades-long career that gave voice to the struggles and triumphs of everyday Americans.
“Some may ask: Why should a musician have a statue here in the halls of the great American republic?” House Speaker Mike Johnson said at the unveiling ceremony. “The answer is pretty simple. It’s because America is about more than laws and politics.”
Each state selects two statues to place within the Capitol. The Cash statue is the second new figure Arkansas has sent to replace two existing images that had represented the state at the U.S. Capitol for more than 100 years. Another statue depicting civil rights leader Daisy Bates was unveiled at the Capitol earlier this year. Bates mentored the nine Black children who desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957.
The state’s legislature in 2019 voted to replace Arkansas’ two prior statues, which depicted little-known figures from the 18th and 19th centuries, with Bates and Cash.
Known as the “The Man in Black,” Cash was a vivid storyteller who sang with a deep voice songs like “I Walk The Line,” “Ring of Fire,” “Jackson” and “A Boy Named Sue.” The statue depicts the singer with a guitar slung across his back and a Bible in his hand. Little Rock sculptor Kevin Kresse created the statue.


Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said artistic creativity is an important part of the country’s growth, and Cash’s “substance” and “swagger” inspired generations of artists from every genre imaginable. He quoted singers such as Bob Dylan and Snoop Dogg about Cash’s impact.
“He called Johnny Cash a real American gangster. That a compliment from Snoop Doggy Dogg,” Jeffries said as the audience laughed. “What a life, what a legend, what a legacy.”
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders led a group of Arkansas lawmakers at the ceremony. She said she grew up in a musical family where “after God and country, came Johnny Cash.” She noted how Cash struggled with addiction but went on to perform for prisoners and held a deep religious faith. She described him as a “hymn-singing Christian” who also experienced difficult times.
“When so much in today’s world is fake, Johnny Cash was very real,” Sanders said.
Cash’s daughter, Rosanne Cash, said her father would have viewed the statue “as the ultimate” honor in his life. She said her father’s hard upbringing instilled in him a strong work ethic and that he loved the idea of America as a place of dreams and refuge.
“This man was a living redemption story,” Rosanne Cash said. “He encountered darkness and met it with love.”
Cash was born in Kingsland, a tiny town about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of Little Rock. He died in 2003 at age 71. His achievements include 90 million records sold worldwide spanning country, rock, blues, folk and gospel. He is among the few artists inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.
Cash’s statue will be the newest added to the Capitol since one from North Carolina depicting the Rev. Billy Graham was unveiled in May.

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodia on Friday decried newly imposed U.S. sanctions on one of the country’s top tycoons who has been implicated in allegations of forced labor, human trafficking and lucrative online scams.
Cambodia’s foreign ministry expressed “deep regret over the unjust decision” to sanction Ly Yong Phat and suggested that the action could hurt bilateral relations. Ly Yong Phat, one of Cambodia’s richest men, is also a Cambodian senator and a leading member of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party of Prime Minister Hun Manet. 
The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday imposed sanctions on Ly Yong Phat and five of his businesses “for their role in serious human rights abuses related to the treatment of workers subjected to forced labor in online investment scam operations.” 
“Victims forced to run virtual currency investment scams and other online schemes are often lured by fraudulent jobs and promises of free housing,” said the statement. “Instead, they find themselves forced to run scam operations for criminal organizations under horrifying working and living conditions.”
Washington’s move, which blocks any of Ly Yong Phat’s assets in the United States and prohibits U.S. entities from doing business with him, reflects mounting concern about cybercrime, including from Southeast Asia and Cambodia in particular. 
Cambodia has been the location of cyberscams that include “ pig butchering,” a term that refers to gaining victims’ trust through dating apps or other sites and steering them toward bogus investments. Cryptocurrency is often used in such schemes to make them harder to stop.


Friday’s statement from Cambodia’s foreign ministry claimed the Treasury’s action was “based on unconfirmed reports of forced labor linked to online investment scams,” as well as “politically motivated” and “counter to the spirit of reinforcing our bilateral cooperation and mutual trust.”
Cambodian-U.S. relations have long been strained over Washington’s criticism of alleged political repression and human rights violations by the government, as well as its close relationship to China.
In June, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited Phnom Penh and his meetings with Cambodian officials had suggested the beginning of a thaw in relations between the countries.
Friday’s statement further said the Treasury’s report “fails to provide a balanced and accurate representation of Cambodia’s steadfast commitment to human rights, law enforcement, and its determined efforts to combat human trafficking and forced labor.”
It also praised Ly Yong Phat’s role “in advancing Cambodia’s socio-economic development over the decades” through his L.Y.P. Group. 
Though Ly Yong Phat himself has not faced any human trafficking charges, a casino run by his business has been raided at least twice, and both times authorities rescued people who had been forced to work there in call-center scams and other illicit activities, The Associated Press reported in May. 
Victims cited being lured to O-Smach Resort, a property owned by L.Y.P. Group, with false employment opportunities, having their phones and passports confiscated upon arrival, and being forced to work scam operations. 
The victims also reported being beaten, abused with electric shocks, made to pay a hefty ransom, or threatened with being sold to other online scam gangs.

                Question: What is the franchise record for consecutive scoreless innings set by the Kansas City Royals' pitching staff as of September 26, 2024?

Publication date:2024-09-26 02:46:00

WASHINGTON (AP) — Five Kansas City relievers pitched 6 2/3 innings of two-hit ball after starter Michael Lorenzen’s early exit, Robbie Grossman hit a two-run single, and the Royals held on to the second American League wild card with a 3-0 win over the Washington Nationals on Wednesday night.
“Throwing strikes,” Royals manager Matt Quatraro explained. “We know that’s a big key is to challenge hitters. They have good stuff. They know that.”
Michael Massey singled in a run off DJ Herz (4-9) to help lift the Royals to a second straight shutout victory after a season high-tying seven-game losing streak. 
Kansas City and Detroit are both 84-74 but the Royals hold the head-to-head tiebreaker advantage over the Tigers for the second wild-card spot. The Tigers beat the Rays 7-1 on Wednesday night.
Daniel Lynch IV (2-0) worked 2 2/3 scoreless frames in relief of Lorenzen, who exited with lower body fatigue after 2 1/3 innings in his first start since sustaining a left hamstring strain on Aug. 27.
Lynch has not allowed a run in 10 relief appearances since he was recalled from Triple-A Omaha on Aug. 26.
“Since he’s come back up, he’s thrown the ball exceptionally well. And that was a huge part of tonight as well,” Quatraro said.
Angel Zerpa, John Schreiber and Sam Long bridged the gap to Lucas Erceg, who completed his 13th save. That effort extended the Kansas City bullpen’s scoreless streak to 15 2/3 innings over four games, and the pitching staff’s overall scoreless run to a franchise record 26 innings.


“When it’s going Zerpa to Schrieber to Long to Erceg, I mean that’s pretty nasty guys,” Lynch said. “So I think that when guys just keep going and doing their jobs, it makes it easier.”
James Wood and Nasim Nuñez had the only hits for Washington, which fell to a third consecutive shutout defeat and has lost eight of its last nine games.
“I think they’re pressing for sure,” Nats manager Dave Martinez said. “We’ve just got to go out there and relax tomorrow and just get a good pitch to hit.”
Lorenzen cruised through the first two innings but departed with a batter retired in the third after a brief visit from the team medical staff. He threw 28 pitches, striking out two and officially issuing two walks, the latter coming on the at-bat that Lynch completed.
Royals: Kansas City optioned RHP Steven Cruz to Triple-A Omaha to make room for Lorenzen.
Nationals: Manager Dave Martinez confirmed that All-Star shortstop CJ Abrams has reported to the club’s complex in West Palm Beach, Florida as planned and will work out there through Sunday. Abrams was demoted from the major league team Saturday for what was termed an internal matter. UP NEXT
Left-hander Patrick Corbin (6-13, 5.58 ERA) will pitch likely his final game for the Washington Nationals on Thursday. He is the last remaining active Nationals player who was on the 2019 World Series-winning team. His six-year, $140-million contract expires at the end of the season. RHP Michael Wacha (13-8, 3.28) goes for Kansas City.

ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Floodwaters pushed by the remnants of Hurricane Helene left North Carolina’s largest mountain city isolated Saturday by damaged roads and a lack of power and cellphone service, part of a swath of destruction across southern Appalachia that left an unknown number dead and countless worried relatives unable to reach loved ones.

The storm spread misery across western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, where on Friday authorities used a helicopter to rescue dozens of people from the rooftop of a flooded hospital. In North Carolina alone, more than 400 roads remained closed on Saturday as floodwaters began to recede and reveal the extent of damage. 

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said supplies were being airlifted to that part of the state. Buncombe County officials said Interstate 26 between Asheville and South Carolina had reopened, but most other routes into the city were impassible. 

Among those rescued from rising waters was nurse Janetta Barfield, whose car was swamped on Friday morning as she left an overnight shift at Asheville’s Mission Hospital. She said she watched a car in front of her drive through standing water and thought it was safe to proceed. But her car stalled, and within minutes water had filled her front seat up to her chest. A nearby police officer helped her to safety.

“It was unbelievable how fast that creek got just in like five minutes,” Barfield said.



Early Saturday morning, many gas stations were closed because they didn’t have electricity, and the few that were open had hourlong lines wrapped around the block. Where traffic lights were dark, drivers treated the intersections as four-way stops. The hub of tourism and arts, home to about 94,000 people, was unusually still after floodwaters swamped neighborhoods known for drawing visitors including Biltmore Village and the River Arts District, which is home to numerous galleries, shops and breweries. 

More than 700,000 customers were without power across North Carolina, including about 100,000 in Buncombe County. 

In Asheville, there was no cellular service and no timeline for restoration. Residents were also directed to boil their water. Local officials said they were working on setting up hubs to distribute food and water.

“We have had some loss of life,” County Emergency Services Director Van Taylor Jones told reporters. However, he said they were not ready to report specifics as they were hindered in contacting next of kin by the communications outages. Police Chief Michael Lamb said his department had a list of about 60 people who relatives had not been able to reach and were seeking welfare checks.

As of Saturday night, the governor’s office confirmed 10 storm deaths statewide but did not provide a breakdown of where they occurred. 

Officials said they tried to prepare for the storm but its magnitude was beyond what they could have imagined.

“It’s not that we (were) not prepared, but this is going to another level,” Sheriff Quentin Miller said. “To say this caught us off guard would be an understatement.” 

Atlanta resident Francine Cavanaugh said she has been unable to reach her sister, son or friends in the Asheville area.

“My sister checked in with me yesterday morning to find out how I was in Atlanta,” she said on Saturday. “The storm was just hitting her in Asheville, and she said it sounded really scary outside.”

Cavanaugh said her sister told her she was going to head out to check on guests at a vacation cabin, “and that’s the last I heard of her. I’ve been texting everyone that I know with no response. All phone calls go directly to voicemail.”

About 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Asheville in the town of Edneyville, Genevieve Preece was grateful that her family’s home was largely spared and still had water, power and Wi-Fi. Many neighbors were less fortunate.

Preece, who owns a utility contracting firm, opened her home as a place of refuge for people who needed to fill up water jugs or get in contact with worried family members. Her husband spent hours cutting trees to clear roads with neighbors.

“We need help badly, but we are all doing what we can,” Preece said. “It will be months or years to put us back together again.”

In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee and other officials toured the northeastern part of the state by helicopter Saturday. He called the scene “heartbreaking.”

“There’s a great deal of damage, a great deal of heartache, a great deal of work to be done,” Lee said.

U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger expressed disbelief at the extent of the damage.

“It’s something like we’ve never seen in this part of the state. Who would have thought a hurricane would do this much damage in East Tennessee?”

In Greene County, Tennessee, the threat from a stressed dam had passed by Saturday afternoon. The Tennessee Valley Authority, which had warned residents overnight that the Nolichucky Dam could breach, said a thorough review determined it was “stable and secure.” It was one of several being closely monitored. 

Along the Pigeon River, the small Tennessee city of Newport suffered heavy flooding.

Kendale Ball, who opened his Simpl Cafe in June after relocating from Knoxville, said the water reached nearly thigh-high.

“We never anticipated it to be this devastating,” he said of the storm. 

They tried to move some equipment ahead of the flooding but left town when an emergency evacuation was ordered.

“I know we lost our walk-in cooler, all the refrigeration. We’ll have to assess some of the other stuff.”

In Unicoi County, where the people were rescued from the hospital, Elin Fisher and her husband had to move their camper three times to stay ahead of rising waters. They also helped to move eight other campers.

“We would move things and go, ‘Oh, we’re 30 feet above the waterline,’ go help somebody else move their thing to that level, and go, ‘Oh. We’ve got to move. Again.’ And it was just really, really rapid,” said Fisher, who along with her husband teaches whitewater standup paddleboarding on the Nolichucky River. In the middle of the final move, officials closed the road.

“All of our belongings and our home is on the other side of the river, and we can’t get to it,” she said.

Several people died early Sunday during a failed attempt to cross the English Channel from northern France, French authorities said.
A rescue operation is underway, and survivors of the tragedy have been taken to the sports hall in the northern town of Ambleteuse, according to a statement from the prefecture of Pas-de-Calais region.
The incident Saturday occurred nearly two weeks after a boat carrying migrants ripped apart in the English Channel as they attempted to reach Britain from northern France, plunging dozens into the treacherous waterway and leaving 13 dead, officials said. 
On Saturday, French coast guard and navy vessels rescued 200 people from the treacherous waters in the Pas-de-Calais area, according to a report sent by French maritime authorities in charge of the Channel and the North Sea. 
They said they observed 18 attempts of boat departures from France to Britain on Saturday. 
Before Saturday’s accident, at least 43 migrants had died or gone missing while trying to cross to the U.K. this year, according to the International Organization for Migration.
In July, four migrants died  while attempting the crossing on an inflatable boat that capsized and punctured. Five others, including a child, died in another attempt in April. Five dead were recovered from the sea or found washed up along a beach after a migrant boat ran into difficulties in the dark and winter cold of January.",False

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Buffalo Bills starting middle linebacker Terrel Bernard is out indefinitely after hurting a pectoral muscle, with coach Sean McDermott on Friday not ruling out placing the starter on the short-term injured reserve list.
McDermott said the team is still having internal discussions on whether to place Bernard on IR, and making him eligible to return after missing a minimum four games. Bernard didn’t return after being hurt while making a tackle in the first quarter a 31-10 win over the Miami Dolphins on Thursday night.
His injury leaves Buffalo without its two starting linebackers, with Matt Milano out until at least December with a torn left biceps.
The Bills are already thin in experience at linebacker. Second-year player Dorian Williams is starting in place of Milano, while third-year player Baylon Spector stepped in to replace Bernard. The primary backups are veteran free-agent addition Nicholas Morrow and undrafted rookie free agent Joe Andreessen, with no linebackers currently on the team’s practice squad.
McDermott also provided an update on nickel cornerback Taron Johnson, saying the starter is listed week to week and not expected to be placed on short-term IR. Johnson is sidelined after hurting his right forearm in Buffalo’s season-opening 34-28 win against Arizona on Sunday.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Pope Francis’ burdensome trip through Belgium reached new lows on Saturday when defiant Catholic university women demanded to his face a “paradigm change” on women’s issues in the church and then expressed deep disappointment when Francis dug in.
The Catholic University of Louvain, the Francophone campus of Belgium’s storied Catholic university, issued a scathing statement after Francis visited and repeated his view that women are the “fertile” nurturers of the church, inducing grimaces in his audience. 
“UCLouvain expresses its incomprehension and disapproval of the position expressed by Pope Francis regarding the role of women in the church and society,” the statement said, calling the pope’s views “deterministic and reductive.”
Francis’ trip to Belgium, ostensibly to celebrate the university’s 600th anniversary, was always going to be difficult, given Belgium’s wretched legacy of clerical sexual abuse and secular trends which have emptied churches in the once staunchly Catholic country.
Francis got an earful on Friday about the abuse crisis starting with King Philippe and Prime Minister Alexander Croos and continuing on down to the victims themselves. 
But it’s one thing for the pope to be lambasted by the liberal prime minister for the church’s mishandling of priests who raped children. It’s quite another to be openly criticized by the Catholic university that invited him and long was the Vatican’s intellectual fiefdom in Belgium.


The students made an impassioned plea to Francis for the church to change its view of women. It is an issue Francis knows well: He has made some changes during his 11-year pontificate, allowing women to serve as acolytes, appointing several women to high-ranking positions in the Vatican, and saying women must have greater decision-making roles in the church.
But he has ruled out ordaining women as priests and has refused so far to budge on demands to allow women to serve as deacons, who perform many of the same tasks as priests. He has taken the women’s issue off the table for debate at the Vatican’s upcoming three-week synod, or meeting, because it’s too thorny to be dealt with in such a short time. He has punted it to theologians and canonists to chew over into next year.
In a letter read aloud on stage with the pope listening attentively, the students noted that Francis’ landmark 2015 environmental encyclical Laudato Si (Praised Be) made virtually no mention of women, cited no woman theologians and “exalts their maternal role and forbids them access to ordained ministries.”
“Women have been made invisible. Invisible in their lives, women have also been invisible in their intellectual contributions,” the students said.
“What, then, is the place of women in the church?” they asked. “We need a paradigm shift, which can and must draw on the treasures of spirituality as much as on the development of the various disciplines of science.”
Francis said he liked what they said, but repeated his frequent refrain that “the church is woman,” only exists because the Virgin Mary agreed to be the mother of Jesus and that men and women were complementary.
“Woman is fertile welcome. Care. Vital devotion,” Francis said. “Let us be more attentive to the many daily expressions of this love, from friendship to the workplace, from studies to the exercise of responsibility in the church and society, from marriage to motherhood, from virginity to the service of others and the building up of the kingdom of God.”
Louvain said such terminology had no place in a university or society today. It emphasized the point with the entertainment for the event featuring a jazz rendition of Lady Gaga’s LGBTQ+ anthem “Born This Way.” 
“UC Louvain can only express its disagreement with this deterministic and reductive position,” the statement said. “It reaffirms its desire for everyone to flourish within it and in society, whatever their origins, gender or sexual orientation. It calls on the church to follow the same path, without any form of discrimination.”
The comment followed a speech on Friday by the rector of the Dutch campus of the university in which he ventured that the church would be a much more welcoming place if women could be priests.
The university’s back-to-back criticism was especially significant since Francis was long held up in Europe as a beacon of progressive hope following the conservative papacies of St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI.
And yet Francis toed the conservative line earlier in the day too.
He went to the royal crypt in the Church of Our Lady to pray at the tomb of King Baudouin, best known for having refused to give royal assent, one of his constitutional duties, to a parliament-approved bill legalizing abortion. 
Baudouin stepped down for one day in 1990 to allow the government to pass the law, which he would otherwise have been required to sign, before he was reinstated as king. 
Francis praised Baudouin’s courage when he decided to “leave his position as king to not sign a homicidal law,” according to the Vatican summary of the private encounter, which was attended by Baudouin’s nephew, King Philippe, and Queen Mathilde. 
The pope then referred to a new legislative proposal to extend the legal limit for an abortion in Belgium, from 12 weeks to 18 weeks after conception. The bill failed at the last minute because parties in government negotiations considered the timing inopportune.
Francis urged Belgians to look to Baudouin’s example in preventing such a law, and added that he hoped the former king’s beatification cause would move ahead, the Vatican said.
Valentine Hendrix, a 22-year-old international relations masters student at Louvain, told reporters that students had hoped that Francis might respond positively to their appeal, but that his comments on abortion and women’s role meant that he had “given up on a committed dialogue.”
“We had expectations, even if we saw that he disappointed us in just a few hours,” she said. “His position on abortion — by saying that the abortion law was a murderous law — it is extremely shocking to see even if we did not expect great moves toward modernity.” 
Francis started the day by having breakfast — coffee and croissants — with a group of 10 homeless people and migrants who are looked after by the St. Gilles parish of Brussels.
The breakfast encounter was presided over by Marie-Françoise Boveroulle, an adjunct episcopal vicar for the diocese. The position is usually filled by a priest, but Boveroulle’s appointment has been highlighted as evidence of the roles that women can and should play in the church.

MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli strikes Monday on Lebanon killed more than 490 people, including more than 90 women and children, Lebanese authorities said, in the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. The Israeli military warned residents in southern and eastern Lebanon to evacuate ahead of its widening air campaign against Hezbollah.

Thousands of Lebanese fled the south, and the main highway out of the southern port city of Sidon was jammed with cars heading toward Beirut in the biggest exodus since 2006. 

Lebanon’s health ministry said the strikes killed 492 people, including 35 children and 58 women, and wounded 1,645 people — a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week.

In a recorded message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Lebanese civilians to heed Israeli calls to evacuate, saying “take this warning seriously.”

“Please get out of harm’s way now,” Netanyahu said. “Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.”

Israel’s military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the army will do “whatever is necessary” to push Hezbollah from Lebanon’s border with Israel.

Hagari claimed Monday’s widespread airstrikes had inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah. But he would not give a timeline for the operation and said Israel was prepared to launch a ground invasion of Lebanon if needed.

“We are not looking for wars. We are looking to take down the threats,” he said. “We will do whatever is necessary to do to achieve this mission.”

Hagari said Hezbollah has launched some 9,000 rockets and drones into Israel since last October, including 250 on Monday alone.

The military said Israeli warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets Monday, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones. The spokesman said many were hidden in residential areas, showing photos of what he said were weapons concealed in private homes.

“Hezbollah has turned southern Lebanon into a war zone,” he told a news conference.

Israel estimates Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including guided missiles and long-range projectiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel.

Earlier Monday evening, the Israeli military said it had carried out a targeted strike in Beirut. It did not give details. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported three missiles hit southern Beirut’s Beir al-Abed neighborhood. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV said six people were wounded. 

Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said the earlier strikes hit hospitals, medical centers and ambulances. The government ordered schools and universities to close across most of the country and began preparing shelters for the displaced.

Some strikes hit residential areas in the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. One hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos, more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) from the border north of Beirut.

Israel said it was expanding the airstrikes to include areas of the valley along Lebanon’s eastern border with Syria. Hezbollah has long had an established presence in the valley, where the group was founded in 1982 with the help of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in the wake of Israel’s invasion and occupation of Lebanon.

Israel’s military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Israel was preparing its “next phases” of operations against Hezbollah, and that its airstrikes were “proactive,” targeting Hezbollah infrastructure built over the past 20 years.

Halevi said the goal was to allow displaced Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel. 

Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it fired dozens of rockets toward Israel, including at military bases. It also targeted for a second day the facilities of the Rafael defense firm, headquartered in Haifa.

The evacuation warnings were the first of their kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters.

The increasing strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of all-out war, even as Israel battles Hamas in Gaza and tries to negotiate the release of scores of hostages taken in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. 

A spokeswoman for President Joe Biden said the administration was concerned about what’s happening between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and insisted that getting a cease-fire deal between Israel and Gaza was key to easing tensions in the region.

“It’s in everyone’s interest to resolve it quickly and diplomatically,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden to New York, where he is to deliver his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.

A State Department official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the private diplomatic efforts, said the U.S. and numerous other countries were keen to present an “off-ramp” for both Israel and Hezbollah to reduce tensions and prevent an all-out war. 

The U.S. has “concrete ideas” for restoring calm that it will present to allies and partners at this week’s U.N. General Assembly, the official said. He wouldn’t detail what the “concrete ideas” were because he said they had yet to be presented to allies and partners for what he termed a “stress test” for their likelihood of success.

U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border, meanwhile, have stopped their patrols and are staying in their bases “given the volume of exchange of fire,” a U.N. spokesman said. Stéphane Dujarric told reporters that U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres was “alarmed” at the escalating violence and large number of civilian casualties reported in Lebanon.

Monday’s death toll far surpassed that of Beirut’s devastating port explosion in 2020, when hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse detonated, killing at least 218 people and wounding more than 6,000.

The Lebanese Health Ministry asked hospitals in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley to postpone non-urgent surgeries to treat people wounded by “Israel’s expanding aggression on Lebanon.”

On Monday, residents received text messages reading: “If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,” Lebanese media reported.

Lebanon’s information minister, Ziad Makary, said his office in Beirut had received a recorded message telling people to leave the building.

“This comes in the framework of the psychological war implemented by the enemy,” Makary said, and urged people “not to give the matter more attention than it deserves.”

Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied because of the near-daily exchanges of fire.

Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead the Israeli military to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in.

An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children.

Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility.

Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified.

Hezbollah has said it will keep up attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary.

Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November.

Israel’s offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said Friday that it plans to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement that calls for tech giant Microsoft to buy the power to supply its data centers with carbon-free energy.
The announcement by Constellation Energy comes five years after its then-parent company Exelon shut down the plant, saying it was losing money and that Pennsylvania lawmakers had refused to subsidize it.
The plan to restart Three Mile Island’s Unit 1 comes amid something of a renaissance for nuclear power, as policymakers are increasingly looking to it to bail out a fraying electric power supply, help avoid the worst effects of climate change and meet rising power demand driven by data centers.
The plant, on an island in the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The accident destroyed one reactor, Unit 2, and left the plant with one functioning reactor, Unit 1.
Buying the power is designed to help Microsoft meet its commitment to be “carbon negative” by 2030.
Microsoft wouldn’t say which of its data centers will be powered by the nuclear plant, but the mid-Atlantic electricity grid spans from Virginia, a data center hub for Microsoft and other tech giants, to Ohio, where Microsoft has plans for a new data center complex outside Columbus. 


Constellation said it hopes to bring Unit 1 online in 2028. Restarting the reactor will require approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as permits from state and local agencies, Constellation said. 
To restart Unit 1, Constellation will spend $1.6 billion to restore equipment including the turbine, generator, main power transformer and cooling and control systems. It is not currently seeking state or federal subsidies to help, it said.
Microsoft and Constellation didn’t release terms of their agreement. 
Jacopo Buongiorno, a nuclear science and engineering professor and director of MIT’s Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems, said Microsoft will likely pay above market price for electricity that is both carbon-free and reliable.
Restarting the plant is realistic, but not easy, Buongiorno said.
“It all depends on what’s the state of the components, the systems,” Buongiorno said. 
The process will go fairly smoothly if they were maintained well while it was shut down, Buongiorno said. A Constellation spokesperson said the plant itself is in excellent condition.
The closest example of restarting a nuclear plant is underway in Michigan, Buongiorno said. There, the federal government has promised a $1.5 billion loan to restart the Palisades nuclear plant, shut down in 2022.
The business model of the Constellation-Microsoft agreement makes sense for both sides, Buongiorno said. Plus, it is cheaper to restart a nuclear power plant than build one from scratch, he said. Already intact are transmission lines, cooling towers, the control buildings and concrete containment structures, he said.
Constellation’s announcement comes after a wave of coal-fired and nuclear power plants have shut down in the past decade as competition from cheap natural gas flooded power markets.
That has elicited warnings that the U.S. is facing an electric reliability crisis. Meanwhile, demand is fast-growing from data centers run by tech giants like Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to provide cloud computing and digital services such as artificial intelligence systems.
In the U.S., growth in electricity demand is concentrated in states — primarily Virginia and Texas — that are seeing the rapid development of large-scale data centers, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.
The data centers’ share of U.S. electricity use in the United States is around 4% currently, with some projections expecting that to double by 2030.
The Constellation-Microsoft agreement comes amid a push by the Biden administration, states and utilities to reconsider using nuclear power to try to limit plant-warming greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector.
Last year, Georgia Power began producing electricity from the first American nuclear reactor to be built in decades, after the accident at Three Mile Island froze interest in building new ones.
Before it was shut down in 2019, Three Mile Island’s Unit 1 had a generating capacity of 837 megawatts, which is enough to power more than 800,000 homes, Constellation said. 
The destroyed Unit 2 is sealed, and its twin cooling towers remain standing. Its core was shipped years ago to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory. What is left inside the containment building remains highly radioactive and encased in concrete. 
The late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT — built with help from Microsoft’s data centers — ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.
Google and Microsoft both acknowledged this year that AI’s electricity needs are making it harder for them to meet the ambitious climate targets they set before the AI boom.
“Microsoft, above and beyond their own products, are also providing the compute for OpenAI, which is growing and expanding very ambitiously,” said Sasha Luccioni, a researcher at AI company Hugging Face who has called attention to AI’s carbon footprint. “They have to scramble to get all the energy that they can in order to be able to fuel that growth.”

SEATTLE (AP) — Texas Rangers right-hander Max Scherzer is expected to return from the injured list on Saturday in Seattle after a successful workout Friday.
Scherzer was limited earlier this year after offseason back surgery, then began to experience shoulder and nerve pain in his right arm after he returned to the rotation. Scherzer is 2-4 with a 3.89 ERA in eight starts and 39 1/3 innings this season.
His last start was July 30. He had a successful rehab appearance on Saturday for Triple-A Round Rock in Las Vegas, throwing 59 pitches and striking out four in four scoreless innings. 
Even with the defending World Series champion Rangers all but eliminated from postseason contention, Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, felt it was important to prove he can overcome the injuries that have plagued the last 18 months of his once-dominant career.
“It’s just frustrating because … I pride myself on making my starts, going 30-plus starts every single year,” Scherzer said before Texas played Seattle on Friday night. “To be sitting on the IL like this, it’s boring. It’s frustrating. You’re not out there competing with the team. I’ve never dealt with this in my career. So, you know, I’m sick of it.”
The 40-year-old said he was not concerned about his command or the liveliness of his arm. His current focus as he finishes the season is to employ what he’s learned about the status of his arm. He’ll focus on new aspects of training in the offseason that he hopes will alleviate the discomfort he’s been feeling.


“It’s just proving that I’m healthy … that I’m not dealing with (thoracic outlet syndrome), I’m not dealing with shoulder injuries,” Scherzer said. “I’m managing what I’ve got going on and I can be out there, I can be healthy and I can make my starts.”
Scherzer’s expected start Saturday at Seattle will be the third straight highly anticipated appearance by a starter for the Rangers. Prized prospect Kumar Rocker pitched Thursday and Jacob deGrom returned from surgery on Friday for his first appearance since April 28, 2023. 
Manager Bruce Bochy said deGrom and Scherzer would be likely on a similar pitch count of 60.
“It’s been exciting the last few days as we’ve been prepping for this and just getting ready for these three guys to go,” Bochy said.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Sao Paulo state’s government said it will deploy hundreds of police officers and provide escorts for team buses for Friday’s NFL game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers after some players expressed concern about playing in Brazil. 
Security operations for the game in Sao Paulo’s NeoQuimica Arena will be coordinated with U.S. authorities, the state’s public security secretariat said in a statement Wednesday. Gun violence and crime rates in Brazil are among the highest in the Latin America. Metropolitan Sao Paulo has also faced a wave of cellphone thefts.
Hundreds of civilian and military police will be deployed for the game, the first NFL match to be played in the South American country, according to the statement. Military police will be used to escort the teams’ buses to their hotels, training grounds and to the stadium. 
“Our policing will be beefed up during the week to secure the public’s safety for this historic match, with officers on the streets and avenues around the stadium, in public transportation, in the hotels and in tourist areas of the city,” the security secretariat said. 
Earlier this week, Eagles cornerback Darius Slay said in a podcast he did not want to go to Brazil because of the country’s crime rate. AJ Brown, a wide receiver of the same team, told said he will probably stay in his hotel room throughout his time in Sao Paulo. Other players expressed similar concerns.


On Saturday, San Francisco 49ers rookie receiver Ricky Pearsall was shot in the chest during an attempted robbery in central San Francisco. 
Sao Paulo state’s government said it will also send trained dogs to the stadium before the match to detect potential explosive devices that could put fans or players in danger. Helicopters and drones will also be used.
Sao Paulo police will have a station inside the stadium to support women who are victims of violence.

PERRY, Fla. (AP) — Massive rains from powerful Hurricane Helene left people stranded, without shelter and awaiting rescue Saturday, as the cleanup began from a tempest that killed at least 64 people, caused widespread destruction across the U.S. Southeast and left millions without power. 
“I’ve never seen so many people homeless as what I have right now,” said Janalea England, of Steinhatchee, Florida, a small river town along the state’s rural Big Bend, as she turned her commercial fish market into a storm donation site for friends and neighbors, many of whom couldn’t get insurance on their homes.
Helene blew ashore in Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane late Thursday with winds of 140 mph (225 kph).
From there, it quickly moved through Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp said Saturday that it “looks like a bomb went off” after viewing splintered homes and debris-covered highways from the air. Weakened, Helene then soaked the Carolinas and Tennessee with torrential rains, sending creeks and rivers over their banks and straining dams. 
Western North Carolina was isolated because of landslides and flooding that forced the closure of Interstate 40 and other roads. All those closures delayed the start of the East Tennessee State University football game against The Citadel because the Buccaneers’ drive to Charleston, South Carolina, took 16 hours. 
There have been hundreds of water rescues, none more dramatic than in rural Unicoi County in East Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were plucked by helicopter from a hospital rooftop Friday. And the rescues continued into the following day in Buncombe County, North Carolina, where part of Asheville was under water.


“To say this caught us off guard would be an understatement,” said Quentin Miller, the county sheriff.
Asheville resident Mario Moraga said it’s “heartbreaking” to see the damage in the Biltmore Village neighborhood and neighbors have been going house to house to check on each other and offer support. 
“There’s no cell service here. There’s no electricity,” he said. 
While there have been deaths in the county, Emergency Services Director Van Taylor Jones said he wasn’t ready to report specifics, partially because downed cell towers hindered efforts to contact next of kin. 
Relatives put out desperate pleas for help on Facebook. Among those waiting for news was Francine Cavanaugh, whose sister told her she was going to check on guests at a vacation cabin as the storm began hitting Asheville. Cavanaugh, who lives in Atlanta, hasn’t been able to reach her since then.
“I think that people are just completely stuck,” she said.
The storm, now a post-tropical cyclone, was expected to hover over the Tennessee Valley on Saturday and Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. 
It unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina, where Gov. Roy Cooper described it as “catastrophic” as search and rescue teams from 19 states and the federal government came to help. One community, Spruce Pine, was doused with over 2 feet (0.6 meters) of rain from Tuesday through Saturday.
And in Atlanta, 11.12 inches (28.24 centimeters) of rain fell over 48 hours, the most the city has seen over two days since record keeping began in 1878.
President Joe Biden said Saturday that Helene’s devastation has been “overwhelming” and pledged to send help. He also approved a disaster declaration for North Carolina, making federal funding available for affected individuals. 
With at least 25 killed in South Carolina, Helene is the deadliest tropical cyclone for the state since Hurricane Hugo killed 35 people when it came ashore just north of Charleston in 1989. Deaths also have been reported in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.
Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in property damage. AccuWeather’s preliminary estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Helene in the U.S. is between $95 billion and $110 billion. 
Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful cyclones sometimes in a matter of hours. 
Evacuations began before the storm hit and continued as lakes overtopped dams, including one in North Carolina that forms a lake featured in the movie “Dirty Dancing.” Helicopters were used to rescue some people from flooded homes.
And in Newport, Tennessee, Jonah Wark waited so long to evacuate that a boat had to come to the rescue. “Definitely a scary moment,” Wark said.
After touring the damage by helicopter, a stunned U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger said, “Who would have thought a hurricane would do this much damage in East Tennessee?” 
Among the 11 confirmed deaths in Florida were nine people who drowned in their homes in a mandatory evacuation area on the Gulf Coast in Pinellas County, where St. Petersburg is located, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. 
None of the victims were from Taylor County, which is where the storm made landfall. It came ashore near the mouth of the Aucilla River, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of where Hurricane Idalia hit last year at nearly the same ferocity. 
“If you had told me there was going to be 15 feet to 18 feet of storm surge, even with the best efforts, I would have assumed we would have had multiple fatalities,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday. 
Taylor County is in Florida’s Big Bend, went years without taking a direct hit from a hurricane. But after Idalia and two other storms in a little over a year, the area is beginning to feel like a hurricane superhighway.
“It’s bringing everybody to reality about what this is now with disasters,” said John Berg, 76, a resident of Steinhatchee, a small fishing town and weekend getaway.
Timmy Futch of Horseshoe Beach stayed put for the hurricane before driving to high ground when the water reached his house. many homes in the town, which his grandfather helped found, were reduced to piles of lumber. 
“We watched our town get tore to pieces,” Futch said. 
A Florida resident provided a devastating first-hand look at hard-hit Cedar Key Friday morning after parts of the town were flattened by Hurricane Helene.
About 60 miles (100 kilometers) to the north, cars lined up before sunrise Saturday at a free food distribution site in Perry, Florida, amid widespread power outages. 
“We’re making it one day at a time,” said Sierra Land, who lost everything in her fridge, as she arrived at the site with her 5- and 10-year-old sons and her grandmother.
Thousands of utility crew workers descended upon Florida in advance of the hurricane, and by Saturday power was restored to more than 1.9 million homes and businesses. But hundreds of thousands remain without electricity there and in Georgia.
Chris Stallings, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, said crews were focused on opening routes to hospitals and making sure supplies can be delivered to damaged communities.
Helene was the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Mike Tomlin has spent the past few years almost gleefully leaning into an old-school approach that at times has seemed out of step with the modern NFL.
Part of this has been out of necessity. The Pittsburgh Steelers have spent most of the 2020s lacking the components — perhaps the coaching most of all — to build an offense that could keep pace with the teams they’ve been futilely chasing in the AFC.
So Tomlin did what he could to slow the game down. To gum it up with a defense and a thudding running game designed to eat up the clock and keep the Steelers competitive. 
While it’s been just enough to scrape by — for all of the hand-wringing in Pittsburgh this decade, the Steelers have still made the playoffs three out of the past four years — it hasn’t been enough to succeed in late January.
And while the middle of winter remains far away, there’s a very real sense during Pittsburgh’s 3-0 start that this team isn’t built to merely survive. For proof, look no further than the Steelers’ final three possessions in Sunday’s 20-10 win over the Los Angeles Chargers.
Yards: 222. Points: 10, though it easily could have been 13 or 17 if Tomlin hadn’t decided to have quarterback Justin Fields kneel down with the ball at the Chargers 1 in the waning moments. 
Swagger: considerable.
Fields joked an unnamed Los Angeles linebacker was relieved Pittsburgh took its foot off the gas with the game in hand. Left tackle Dan Moore Jr. said the offensive line could sense that the Chargers defensive front was “just done.”


“That’s why we have the most physical training camp in the league, for drives like that,” tight end Pat Freiermuth said.

Meanwhile, Pittsburgh’s defense was overwhelming the Chargers. Elandon Roberts’ sack tweaked Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert’s achy right ankle. Backup Taylor Heinicke entered and found little time to do much of anything, absorbing three sacks in the span of four snaps, symbolic of a second half in which the Chargers were held to minus-5 yards.
Asked if this was the Platonic ideal of a Tomlin-coached game, Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick smiled.
“I think he’d like more stops on defense,” Fitzpatrick said, though it should be noted Pittsburgh has allowed an NFL-low 26 points so far. “I think he’d like to put more points on the board on offense. But I think (today was an) example of well-executed football.”
The kind of football the Steelers have been forced to play for a while now. No wonder they have looked so comfortable finishing off Atlanta, Denver and the Chargers. 
A tight game late is where the Steelers live, and confidence that they will find a way to find a way is rising with each passing week.
“That’s the Pittsburgh way and we love it,” Freiermuth said. “We embrace it and we think it’s great.”
Sticking with the run even when it’s a slog, and it was very much a slog for the first three quarters against the Chargers. 
That changed when Pittsburgh got the ball back with 4:59 to go. The Steelers ran the ball seven times in eight plays, with Najee Harris and Cordarrelle Patterson churning for 68 yards against a Los Angeles front that looked as if it had seen enough.
The early game scripting has left a little bit to be desired. Three of Pittsburgh’s first four drives were quick three-and-outs, with a methodical 13-play, 70-yard touchdown drive breaking the monotony.
While Fields appears to be improving by the week and is completing 73% of his passes through three games, if the offense could provide an early lead, that would only further embolden a pass rush that is among the best in the league.
Wide receiver Calvin Austin III’s pregame ritual includes opening the “Notes” app on his phone and reading messages he’s stored of people who never thought the 5-foot-9, 162-pound former walk-on at Memphis would make it.
After two injury-marred seasons to start his NFL career, Austin found his footing against the Chargers. His 55-yard catch-and-run for a score showcased the quickness that had led the Steelers to take him in the fourth round in 2022. He lined up in the slot, broke inside and outraced a pair of defenders to the end zone.
Spencer Anderson — who has been filling in at left guard for injured Isaac Seumalo — found himself watching from the sideline at times while rookie Mason McCormick filled in. It ultimately may not matter with Seumalo getting closer to returning from a pectoral injury.
Outside linebacker Alex Highsmith left in the second half with a groin injury. Nick Herbig thrived in Highsmith’s absence, picking up two of Pittsburgh’s five sacks. ... Tomlin pulled RB Jaylen Warren in the second half because he didn’t feel Warren looked right. ... Russell Wilson served as the emergency quarterback for a third straight week while he rehabs a calf injury. Considering the way Fields is playing, there is no need for Wilson to rush back. 
8 — the number of times since 1970 that Pittsburgh has started 3-0. The previous seven teams to reach that mark ended up winning a division title.
Try to keep it going next week against Indianapolis (1-2). The Colts bullied Pittsburgh in a 30-13 victory at Lucas Oil Stadium last December.

Publication date:2024-09-28 23:20:00

REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) — The Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah was a “measure of justice” for victims of a four-decade “reign of terror,” President Joe Biden said Saturday.

The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day.

Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023.

“Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,” Biden said in a statement.

He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese. 

Hezbollah attacks against U.S. interests include the truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy and multinational force barracks in Beirut in 1983 and the kidnapping of the Central Intelligence Agency chief of station in Beirut, who died while held captive. The U.S. said Hezbollah leaders armed and trained militias that carried out attacks on American forces during the war in Iraq. 

The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to the group. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel ‘s war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict.



The White House and Pentagon were quick on Friday, shortly after the strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the operation.

“President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden’s description of a “measure of justice.” She added, “Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.”

The confirmation of Nasrallah’s death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike killing Nasrallah.

Biden reiterated on Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah.

“It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,” Biden said.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and dozens of others.

“The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,” Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television.

The State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of U.S. diplomats who are not employed by the embassy in Beirut and authorized the departure of those who are, as well as nonessential employees because of “the volatile and unpredictable security situation” in Lebanon’s capital.

The U.S. embassy in Beirut also posted a link to an online form that Americans in Lebanon can complete if they are interested in possible assistance leaving the country.

The embassy stressed that it was not organizing evacuations and that there are still commercial means to leave, but the request for information appeared to suggest that such plans may be in the works.

The State Department has previously advised American citizens to consider leaving Lebanon and reiterated its warning against all travel to the country.

“Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,” the department said in a statement Saturday. 

The State Department routinely orders or authorizes the departure of nonessential embassy staffers and the families of diplomats when security conditions deteriorate in the country where they are posted.

An ordered departure is not technically an evacuation but does require those affected to leave. An authorized departure allows those affected to leave the country voluntarily at government expense.

Biden, who was spending the weekend at his vacation home in Delaware, and Harris, who was campaigning in California, held a call with national security aides on Saturday to discuss the situation in the Middle East.

In a brief exchange with reporters as he left church on Saturday, Biden did not directly respond to questions about the conflict potentially escalating further.

“It’s time for a cease-fire,” he said.

The president on Friday directed the Pentagon to assess and adjust as necessary the U.S. force posture in the region to enhance deterrence, ensure force protection and support the full range of U.S. objectives. 

He called for the assessment after the Pentagon earlier in the week announced it was sending an unspecified number of additional U.S. troops to the region because of rising tensions.",False

GENEVA (AP) — The World Health Organization said Friday it has granted its first authorization for use of a vaccine against mpox in adults, calling it an important step toward fighting the disease in Africa.
The approval of the vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic A/S means that donors like vaccines alliance Gavi and UNICEF can buy it. But supplies are limited because there’s only a single manufacturer. 
“This first (authorization) of a vaccine against mpox is an important step in our fight against the disease, both in the context of the current outbreaks in Africa, and in future,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 
WHO also said it was creating an “access and allocation mechanism” to try to fairly distribute mpox tests, treatments and vaccines to the countries who need them most.
The U.N. health agency approved the two-dose mpox vaccine for people aged 18 and above. WHO said that while it was not recommending the vaccine for those under 18, the shot may be used in infants, children and adolescents “in outbreak settings where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks.”
WHO recommended that a single dose of the shot could be used to stretch supplies, but emphasized the need to collect more data on how effective the vaccine might be as a single shot.
The mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic was previously authorized by numerous rich countries across Europe and North America during the global mpox outbreak in 2022. Millions of doses given to adults showed the vaccine helped slow the virus’ spread, but there is limited evidence of how it works in children.


Officials at the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that nearly 70% of cases in Congo — the country hardest hit by mpox — are in children younger than 15, who also accounted for 85% of deaths.
Overall, WHO said over 120 countries have confirmed more than 103,000 cases of mpox since the outbreak began two years ago. Its latest tally, as of Sunday, showed that 723 people in more than a dozen countries in Africa have died of the disease.
African experts have estimated they might need about 10 million vaccines to stop the ongoing outbreaks on the continent while donor countries have promised to provide about 3.6 million vaccines. As of last week, Congo had received only about 250,000 doses.
On Thursday, the Africa CDC said 107 new deaths and 3,160 new cases had been recorded in the past week, just a week after it and WHO launched a continent-wide response plan.
Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms like fever, chills and body aches. People with more serious cases can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.",True

CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago White Sox remained tied with the 1962 New York Mets for the modern major league record of 120 losses in a season, rallying to score three runs in the eighth inning and beat the Los Angeles Angels 3-2 on Tuesday night.
Andrew Benintendi hit a tiebreaking, two-out single to help the White Sox (37-120) stave off infamy for at least one more night.
Fans voiced their displeasure with White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf by chanting “Sell the team!” throughout the game and booed when Los Angeles’ Eric Wagaman grounded out to end it, apparently unhappy they didn’t get to witness the record-breaking loss.
“It’s been a long season,” Benintendi said. “I think that people here tonight were maybe trying to see history. But they’re going to have to wait one more day. Maybe.”
Jonathan Cannon pitched three-hit ball over six scoreless innings for Chicago. The White Sox have five games left — two more against the Angels and three at Detroit — to set a record no team wants.
Chicago had never dropped more than 106 games prior to this year. The White Sox passed that mark with plenty of time to spare when the New York Mets beat them on Sept. 1.
Chicago tied the American League record of 119 losses at San Diego on Saturday and matched the ’62 Mets the following day. But with a chance to lose more games than any team since the 1899 Cleveland Spiders went 20-134, the White Sox rallied in unlikely fashion. They were 0-94 when trailing after seven innings.


Los Angeles took a 1-0 lead in the seventh when Kevin Pillar led off with a walk and Wagaman lined a double to right-center against Gus Varland. Jack López connected in the eighth against Prelander Berroa (1-0) for his first career homer to make it 2-0.
Hunter Strickland (3-2) gave up back-to-back doubles to Zach DeLoach and pinch-hitter Bryan Ramos with one out in the eighth to cut it to 2-1. He walked Lenyn Sosa, putting runners on first and second before Brock Burke retired Nicky Lopez on a fly to right.
The White Sox then tied it when second baseman Jack López got twisted around and was unable to catch Luis Robert Jr.’s high pop. Robert was credited with an infield hit. Benintendi then lined his go-ahead single to left.
“I just dropped it,” López said. “It sucks. It cost Jack a win, Burkie a save, Strickland a hold. Just a tough one to swallow.”
Cannon came through with another terrific outing after beating Los Angeles last week. Justin Anderson worked the ninth for his first save.
Jack Kochanowicz pitched three-hit ball over seven innings for Los Angeles (63-94), which moved within one loss of the franchise record held by the 1968 and 1980 teams.
Angels: The Angels have not completely ruled out 3B Anthony Rendon (oblique strain) playing again this season, though manager Ron Washington indicated it’s unlikely. “Still working though that,” Washington said. “We haven’t made a total decision on that yet, but we’re still working through it. I think you make a common-sense deduction, you can answer that one yourself.” Rendon has not played since Sept. 7, the third time in yet another interrupted season that the 34-year-old has been sidelined by injury. ... OF Jordyn Adams was out of the lineup for a fourth straight game with right knee soreness.
White Sox RHP Davis Martin (0-5, 4.27 ERA) looks to get some payback for a loss at Los Angeles last week and pick up his first win since 2022. LHP José Suarez (1-2, 6.08) makes his third start and 22nd appearance for the Angels.

Publication date:2024-09-13 07:00:00

As the pregnant woman’s contractions rolled in every two minutes, staff at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, dispatched an ambulance to send her elsewhere.

Just two minutes later, she gave birth to a 6-pound baby girl in the cab of the ambulance down the road from the 900-bed hospital.

The incident, government investigators concluded last year, was a violation of a federal law that requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients in medical distress before discharging or transferring them.

Yet, Our Lady of the Lake has never been penalized for that incident or any of its other violations of the law. Few emergency rooms ever are.

Just a dozen hospitals have been fined for refusing to treat patients — pregnant or not — over the past two years, an Associated Press analysis of civil monetary penalties issued by the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found. It took years for the government to decide those penalties. 



Not one of the more than 100 emergency rooms that mistreated or turned away pregnant women since 2022, when the Biden administration pledged to toughen enforcement of the law, has been fined.

“What little we know about the investigations have yielded very rare results,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor.

At Our Lady of the Lake, which did not provide comment for this article, inspectors determined the emergency room’s staff members violated the federal mandate seven times since 2017, when they refused a needed surgery to a Medicaid patient with a broken spine, left a suicidal teenager unattended in the lobby and failed to examine another pregnant woman before sending her to another hospital, federal records show.



Other emergency rooms denied care to pregnant women, sometimes leaving them to miscarry in bathrooms, deliver babies in cars or develop risky infections. Some repeatedly flouted the mandate without consequence, including one Tennessee emergency room with such long wait times that a pregnant woman had to be hospitalized for a week after an 8-hour wait and a man with chest pain collapsed in the lobby, then died.

HHS does not demand fines from hospitals that violate the law except in unusual cases where they refuse to improve their practices, agency officials said.

“Because the consequences are so real, we have seen hospitals work with us almost every single time,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement to the AP. “We have been and will continue to be forward leaning here, communicating our intent directly and very seriously to hospital executives and provider associations which is, in part, why we have seen such good cooperation.”

After the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion, the Biden administration turned to a longstanding federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, in a frantic effort to ensure abortion access for women in dire medical circumstances. The White House has argued that to comply with the law, hospitals must provide emergency abortions for pregnant women who need them to save their lives or reproductive organs, despite state abortion bans. 

Asked about the AP’s findings on Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre put blame on former President Donald Trump for appointing three Supreme Court justices who ruled to upend U.S. abortion rights. 

The Biden administration has sent letters to hospitals repeatedly reminding them of that law and the penalties — up to $129,232 per violation or loss of Medicare funding — for flouting it. 

It also has rolled out a new website making it easier for patients to file a complaint if they are rejected, and it promised to expediate those investigations. 

Last year, for example, HHS announced that two facilities — Freeman Health System in Joplin, Missouri, and University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, Kansas — ran afoul of the federal law after refusing an emergency abortion to Mylissa Farmer. 

Doctors at both hospitals told the 41-year old Missouri woman that her baby had no chance of surviving after her water broke at 17 weeks but because a fetal heartbeat was still detectable, her condition needed to worsen before they’d be willing to terminate her pregnancy. 

Neither hospital has been fined. 

“It would be welcomed if the federal government took a stronger enforcement role in those cases.” said Alison Tanner, an attorney for National Women’s Law Center who represents Farmer. “We have a maternal health crisis in this country and in states with bans on abortion care, it is far worse and more dangerous.” 

Tanner said the HHS Office of Inspector General, which is responsible for issuing fines for violations of the law, is investigating Farmer’s case. The office declined to comment on cases under review. 

The government’s most recent fines against hospitals that turned away pregnant patients were cases from years ago. 

A Tennessee hospital agreed to pay a $100,000 fine for a 2018 case involving a pregnant patient who was discharged and gave birth in a car at 42 weeks pregnant. A Kentucky hospital was fined $90,000 for refusing to help a patient with an ectopic pregnancy in 2021. 

After a complaint against a hospital is filed, a state surveyor investigates the hospital. A physician and the federal government review the findings to determine whether or not a patient received inadequate treatment. If an emergency room violated the federal law, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may refer the case to the HHS inspector general to consider penalties. 

Those investigations are “slow, insufficiently staffed, with a lot of pushback tolerated from hospitals,” Rosenbaum, an expert on the law, said. 

Emergency rooms were supposed to stop turning away patients in medical crisis decades ago, when Congress passed bipartisan legislation designed to prohibit patient dumping that then-Republican President Ronald Reagan signed in 1986. 

The law requires facilities that accept Medicare funding to provide a medical screening exam to anyone who shows up at or near their door and offer stabilizing treatment, if needed. Emergency rooms without the resources or staff to properly treat that patient are required to arrange a medical transfer to another hospital, after they’ve confirmed the facility can accept the patient. 

The law, Sen. David Durenberger promised nearly 40 years ago as he rallied for its passage, would be a warning to private hospitals that had been dumping pregnant patients and gunshot victims on the doorsteps of public hospitals. 

“This amendment is to send a clear signal to the hospital community,” he said on the floor of Congress. “That all Americans, regardless of wealth or status, should know that a hospital will provide what services it can when they are truly in distress.” 

But a decade ago, a report published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded there was “insufficient regulatory oversight of the law,” and that hospitals were not properly training staff to follow the mandate nor did they have proper funding to comply with it. ___ Associated Press editor Kevin S.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined Wednesday to endorse Kamala Harris or Donald Trump for president, saying neither candidate had sufficient support from the 1.3 million-member union.
“Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business,” Teamsters President Sean M. O’Brien said in a statement. “We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members’ right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges.”
The Teamsters’ rebuff reflected a labor union torn over issues of political identity and policy, one that mirrors a broader national divide. Vice President Harris has unmistakably backed organized labor, while former President Trump has appealed to many white blue-collar workers even as he has openly scorned unions at times. By not endorsing anyone, the Teamsters are essentially ceding some influence in November’s election as both candidates claimed to have support from its members.
Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt noted in an emailed statement that more than three dozen retired Teamsters spoke last month in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention, having endorsed Harris. Their pensions were saved through the 2021 passage of the Butch Lewis Act that President Joe Biden and Harris championed.
“While Donald Trump says striking workers should be fired, Vice President Harris has literally walked the picket line and stood strong with organized labor for her entire career,” Hitt said. “The Vice President’s strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her — alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor.”


The Teamsters said Wednesday that internal polling of members showed Trump with an advantage over Harris, a fact that the Republican’s campaign immediately seized upon by sending out an email that said the “rank-and-file of the Teamsters Union supports Donald Trump for President.”
Trump called the Teamsters’ decision not to endorse “a great honor.”
“It’s a great honor,” he said. “They’re not going to endorse the Democrats. That’s a big thing.”
Harris met Monday with a panel of Teamsters, having long courted organized labor and made support for the middle class her central policy goal. Trump also met with a panel of Teamsters in January and even invited O’Brien to speak at the Republican National Convention, where the union leader railed against corporate greed.
In an interview Wednesday on Fox News, O’Brien said lack of an endorsement tells candidates that they have to back the Teamsters in the future. “This should be an eye opener for 2028,” he said. “If people want the support of the most powerful union in North America, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, start doing some things to support our members,” he said. 
The Teamsters’ choice to not endorse came just weeks ahead of the Nov. 5 election, far later than endorsements by other large unions such as the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers and the United Auto Workers that have chosen to devote resources to getting out the vote for Harris.
With O’Brien facing a backlash from some Teamsters’ members after speaking at the Republican National Convention, it’s no surprise that the union decided not to make an endorsement, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University.
What to know about the 2024 Election
Trump’s praise of Tesla CEO Elon Musk for firing workers who supposedly went on strike really made a Trump endorsement very unlikely, Wheaton said. “The members were not in total agreement,” he said.
Marick Masters, a business professor emeritus at Wayne State University in Detroit who follows labor issues, said the Teamsters lack of an endorsement suggests a realignment within the union’s membership.
For many workers, issues such as gun control, abortion and border security override Trump’s expressions of hostility to unions, Masters said.
The Teamsters detailed their objections to the candidates in a statement, starting with their objection to a contract implemented by Congress in 2022 on members working in the railroad sector.
The union wanted both candidates to commit to not deploying the Railway Labor Act to resolve contract disputes and avoid a shutdown of national infrastructure, but Harris and Trump both wanted to keep that option open even though the Teamsters said it would reduce its bargaining power.
Harris has pledged to sign the PRO Act, which would strengthen union protections and is something the Teamsters support. Trump, in his roundtable with the Teamsters, did not promise to veto a proposal to make it harder nationwide to unionize.
Other unions have shown trepidation about endorsing either presidential candidate. The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America on Friday ultimately endorsed Harris with a caveat that “the manner in which party leaders engineered Biden’s replacement at the top of the ticket with Vice President Kamala Harris was thoroughly undemocratic,” union leadership said in a statement.
But the Teamsters lack of endorsement also suggests an indifference to the Biden-Harris administration, which signed into law a measure that saved the pensions of millions of union retirees, including many in the Teamsters.
As part of its 2021 pandemic aid, the administration included the Butch Lewis Act to save the underfunded pensions of more than 1 million union workers and retirees’ underfunded pensions. The act was named after a retired Ohio trucker and Teamsters union leader who spent the last years of his life fighting to prevent massive cuts to the Teamsters’ Central States Pension Fund.

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) — Ohio state police will help protect schools in a city at the center of a political furor over Haitian migrants, the governor announced Monday, while local officials canceled an annual celebration of cultural diversity in the fallout over former President Donald Trump’s false claims about pet-eating.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has denounced the debunked rumors that spread online before Trump amplified them at last week’s presidential debate, saying there is no evidence of it. He said at a news conference in Springfield on Monday that dozens of members of the Ohio State Highway Patrol will be stationed in city schools starting Tuesday following a series of threats across the city, sweeping each building every morning before the arrival of faculty or students. Security cameras have also been stationed at strategic spots in the city, and a bomb-sniffing dog will be in the city and available round-the-clock.
“We know that people are very, very concerned,” DeWine said. “But we’ve moved resources into Springfield. People have the right to feel safe as well as being safe.”
Springfield City Hall, several schools, and state motor vehicle offices in Springfield were forced to evacuate last week after receiving bomb threats. At least 33 separate bomb threats were made in recent days, all of them hoaxes, DeWine said. He said some of the threats came from overseas, but declined to name the country.


“The people who are doing this are doing this to sow discord in our community,” said Andy Wilson, director of the Ohio Department of Public Safety. “We just can’t let them do that. We can’t let them do that. We have to keep providing the services that the citizens of Springfield and Clark County expect.”
Springfield has been the focus of intense attention in recent days after Trump, his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and the Republican presidential campaign repeated false claims about Haitian immigrants eating domestic pets and waterfowl.
President Joe Biden, appearing in Philadelphia at the National HBCU Week Conference on Monday, addressed the situation in Springfield, condemning what he called the “lies and hate.”
“It’s wrong. It’s simply wrong. And it must stop,” he said.
Springfield canceled its annual celebration of diversity, arts and culture in response to the threats. The city’s two-day CultureFest had been scheduled to begin Sept. 27 but was called off “in light of recent threats and safety concerns,” Springfield officials announced Monday.
“We deeply regret having to cancel CultureFest, as we know it is a beloved event for our community,” City Manager Bryan Heck said in a statement. “However, the safety of our residents and visitors must come first.”
Two colleges in Springfield held classes virtually on Monday. Wittenberg University said it received two threats over the weekend, “both of which were targeted toward members of the Haitian Community.” Clark State College said it would operate virtually through Friday “due to recent events in Springfield.”
The city itself seemed quiet on Monday. Among the diners at a Creole restaurant were friends Bill Teager and Paul Gomia, who had driven more than an hour to help support a Haitian-owned business.
“We’ve both just been incensed over the last week of what has happened to this town nationally and even locally,” Teager said.
Thousands of Haitian immigrants have settled in recent years in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) from the state capital of Columbus, where they have found work in factories and warehouses that had been struggling to fill job openings. The sudden influx has strained schools, health care facilities and city services and driven up the cost of housing.
DeWine acknowledged that Springfield has challenges but said that it’s a “city that frankly, is on the move. If you look where Springfield was 15 years ago, ten years ago, even five years ago, we’re moving.”
He declined to criticize Trump, saying the Biden administration’s record on immigration is a legitimate topic for debate. But he pointed out that the Haitians in Springfield are there legally under a federal program that allows them to remain in the country temporarily because conditions in Haiti are considered unsafe for them to return.
“The companies hire them because they needed the help and they needed the support,” DeWine said. “These are people who care about their families. These are people who value education. They are hard workers. And I think we should we should respect that.”
He added: “These ... people who are spreading the hate need to move on. They need to go away. They need to stop it.”

CLEVELAND (AP) — Brayan Rocchio singled in Andrés Giménez with the winning run as the AL Central-leading Cleveland Guardians scored three times in the 10th inning to beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 on Wednesday night, reducing their magic number for clinching a playoff berth to one.
Kyle Manzardo and Will Brennan had RBI singles off Ronny Henriquez (1-1) before Michael Tonkin entered and gave up Rocchio’s second career walk-off hit, a chopper to right through a drawn-in infield.
“It’s awesome being with all these guys on the team,” Rocchio said. “That’s a special moment for me. I talked to (manager Stephen) Vogt before the game and he told me, ‘Hey, today you have a chance to win the game,’ and you saw what happened.”
The Guardians, who now have a major league-leading 41 comeback victories this season, can lock up a postseason spot Thursday with a win over Minnesota. 
Josh Naylor hit a pair of solo homers and scored three times for Cleveland, which leads the division by six games over Kansas City with nine games remaining. Naylor’s first shot was a 445-foot rocket to right-center, giving him his initial 30-homer season.
“The biggest game of the year and look what we do,” Brennan said. “The youngest guys on the team get it done. These guys are so prepared, it’s unbelievable.”
The Twins took a 4-2 lead in the top of the 10th on Carlos Correa’s two-run single off Hunter Gaddis (5-3). Correa finished with four RBIs and extended his hitting streak to 16 games, matching his career high with Houston in 2019.


“I was excited about that at-bat and it was a good moment, but it wasn’t good enough,” said Correa, who is batting .377 with five homers and 15 RBIs in his last 17 games. “You just have to keep fighting. It’s a tough sport.”
Twins right-hander Bailey Ober struck out a career-high 12 over seven innings, but remained winless in seven starts since Aug. 9. He allowed two runs without issuing a walk.
With the loss, Minnesota’s lead over Detroit for the final AL wild-card position was sliced to one half a game. The Twins own the tiebreaker over the Tigers and the clubs are done with their season series.
“We had some guys do some pretty great things out there, but it probably hurts more because we’re fighting for everything right now,” Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli said.
Guardians starter Tanner Bibee worked 6 2/3 innings and gave up two runs. The right-hander is 2-0 with a 1.82 ERA in four games against Minnesota this season.
Twins: OF Trevor Larnach (hamstring), who has a career-high 15 homers, served as the designated hitter for his sixth game in a row. Baldelli said Larnach should return to his regular spot in left field before the start of the postseason.
Guardians: RHP Alex Cobb (right third finger blister), who is eligible to come off the injured list on Sept. 24, will determine whether he throws a simulated game or makes a start for Triple-A Columbus. “Really, Alex is driving the bus on this,” Vogt said.
Twins RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (5-5, 4.08 ERA) faces Guardians LHP Joey Cantillo (2-3, 4.99 ERA) in the four-game series finale Thursday.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — When the elections clerk in Wisconsin’s heavily Democratic capital city of Madison announced on Monday that duplicate absentee ballots had mistakenly been sent to around 2,000 voters, it ignited concerns about election integrity from a Republican congressman and others on the right.
Every vote is crucial in Wisconsin, a swing state that President Joe Biden won by just under 21,000 votes in 2020 and that former President Donald Trump won by just under 23,000 votes in 2016. The contest between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris is close this year as well, creating a hyperintense focus on how elections are run.
Madison is in the heart of liberal Dane County, where more than 75% of voters — more than 260,000 people — voted for Biden in 2020. 
Because of Madison’s heavy Democratic tilt, any question about election integrity draws intense scrutiny from Republicans.
Here are some things to know about what happened with the duplicate ballots and the reaction to the error.
Madison’s city clerk who runs elections, Maribeth Witzel-Behl, posted a statement online on Monday night explaining that up to 2,000 duplicate absentee ballots had been sent in error. The statement blamed a data processing error and initially said that only voters in one ward were affected. The statement also said that barcodes on the ballots used to track them would ensure that only one ballot is counted. 
No. There are barcodes on the envelopes that absentee ballots are returned in. Those barcodes make it possible for voters to track the progress of their ballots online. It also allows for election officials to mark off when a voter has cast an absentee ballot, ensuring that they don’t vote again at the polls on Election Day. 


Tiffany seized on the city’s initial statement that did not differentiate between the ballot and the envelope. In a letter to the city, he asked, “Are unique ballot bar codes linked to individual, identifiable voter profiles?”
The city responded by explaining that barcodes are printed on the ballot envelope, not the ballot. “These types of barcodes are used across the state and the country,” the clerk wrote.
Tiffany on Friday defended asking that question, saying he was seeking clarity after the clerk’s initial statement did not clearly say the barcodes were on the envelopes, not the ballots. 
City spokesperson Dylan Brogan said that he altered the wording of the original statement to specify that the barcode is on ballot envelopes after Tiffany asked the barcode question.
Kevin Kennedy, who was Wisconsin’s top elections official for 33 years and is currently a member of three nonpartisan boards that work in elections, said using the term “ballot” when actually referring to the envelope is commonly done both by election workers and the public.
“If that’s the strength of your argument, focusing on someone misspeaking, that’s not the issue,” Kennedy said. “It probably says more about the motives of the speaker if that’s what they’re going to focus on.”
The city posted its response to Tiffany, which included the barcode explanation, at 6:24 p.m. on Wednesday. Eighteen minutes later, Tiffany posted a photo of an absentee ballot and quoted from the city’s initial statement that did not differentiate between the ballot and envelope. 
Tiffany said, “Although the Madison Clerk’s Office claims, ‘The voting system does not allow a ballot with the same barcode to be submitted,’ my office has proof that there is no barcode on the actual ballots. Here is a picture of the absentee ballots – NO BARCODE.”
What to know about the 2024 Election
That post generated more than 2.4 million views on X as of Friday. 
Tiffany said Friday that he was not falsely suggesting that the clerk was lying about barcodes on ballots. Tiffany said he was trying to point out that it was the clerk, not him, who first said the barcodes were on ballots and not the envelopes.
Also on Thursday, X owner Elon Musk, who like Tiffany is a Trump supporter, reposted a message to his nearly 200 million followers that suggested Republicans had discovered that duplicate ballots had been sent.
The error occurred when two data sets were merged, creating a file that listed absentee voters twice, the city spokesperson Brogan said. It was done late last week and discovered on Monday when the city was contacted by a voter who received two ballots, he said. 
None of the duplicate ballots had been returned before the mistake was caught, Brogan said.
The Madison city attorney spoke with the state Republican Party about the incident on Monday before the city made it public and before Tiffany raised questions about it, Brogan said. 
Tiffany’s first public comment about the issue came the day after the city made the public aware of what had happened.
Tiffany, after the city responded to his initial set of questions, on Thursday called for an independent investigation citing “many inconsistencies” including the barcode issue. He also pointed to the city increasing the number of wards affected from one to 10 and the number of duplicate ballots from up to 2,000 to 2,215. 
Democrats were quick to accuse Tiffany of trying to sow distrust in elections. 
“I can’t tell if this is just profound lack of knowledge or the intentional farming of outrage,” Ann Jacobs, the Democratic chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, posted on X. “Both, by the way, are bad.”
Democratic U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore also responded to Tiffany’s post about the barcode calling it “misinformation” and telling him to “knock it off.”
Witzel-Behl, the city clerk, told Tiffany in her response letter that “elections are conducted by humans and occasionally human error occurs.”
“When errors occur, we own up to them, correct them as soon as possible, and are transparent about them – precisely as we have done here,” she said.",False

NEW YORK (AP) — A small asteroid discovered on Wednesday harmlessly burned up in Earth’s atmosphere the same day, NASA said. 
The asteroid — about 3 feet (1 meter) across — was spotted by astronomers in Arizona and broke apart over the coast of the Philippines hours after the discovery. 
This space rock, dubbed 2024 RW1, is only the ninth to have been spotted before its impact. Asteroids around this size hurtle toward Earth about every two weeks without posing any danger. 
The asteroid was discovered through the Catalina Sky Survey, which is run by the University of Arizona and funded by NASA.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Panthers have benched 2023 No. 1 overall pick Bryce Young after the second-year quarterback’s rough start to the season.
Andy Dalton will take over as the starter for Carolina’s next game on Sunday at Las Vegas.
Panthers head coach Dave Canales said he made the decision after watching game film from Sunday’s 26-3 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. 
He informed both QBs of the decision on Monday after consulting with general manager Dan Morgan and vice president of football operations Brandt Tilis.
“After watching the film and taking in all of the information I feel like Andy gives us the best chance to win,” Canales said.
Canales wouldn’t say if Dalton will remain the starter beyond this week saying “right now the focus is on this week.”
Canales also wouldn’t say exactly what led to the decision to bench Young.
“I don’t want to get into the specifics as those are private conversations,” Canales said.
Canales had worked with Geno Smith in Seattle and Baker Mayfield in Tampa Bay, helping turn their careers around. He was hired in part to get the most out of Young, who struggled last season as a rookie with nearly as many interceptions (10 ) as touchdown passes (11).
But Young’s struggles as a rookie have carried over to this year.
He’s completed just 31 of 56 passes for 244 yards with three interceptions as the Panthers have started 0-2 this season for the second straight year and have been outscored 73-13 by the New Orleans Saints and Chargers. Young has run for one touchdown, the only one of the season for Carolina.


When asked if Young still has the support of the locker room, Canales said “that’s a loaded question. Right now our focus is to make sure that we fix the film from yesterday and get ready for the Raiders.”

Young is 2-16 as a starter overall since the Panthers traded up eight spots in the 2023 NFL draft to get him.
The Panthers made a significant investment in that deal with Chicago, sending wide receiver D.J. Moore and four draft picks to the Bears — one of which turned out to be the No. 1 overall pick in this year’s draft after the Panthers finished a league-worst 2-15 last season. The Bears used that pick to take quarterback Caleb Williams.
Young becomes the first quarterback selected No. 1 overall in the common draft era starting in 1967 to be benched for non-injury reasons in his second season.
He hasn’t looked much like a No. 1 overall pick since his arrival, continually looking flustered in the pocket and often making poor decisions and throwing into double coverage. His first throw this season was an interception against the Saints in the opener and things only seem to have gotten worse.
Young was booed repeatedly by the home crowd on Sunday after the offense stalled time and time again.
Carolina was 1 of 12 on third down conversions and the Panthers were outgained 349-159.
When asked about his confidence after the game, Young said, “I draw my confidence from the Lord. I’m very blessed. I’m grateful for this challenge. Not an ideal start, but God does everything for a reason. I have faith in that.”
Young said he needed to do a better job with his decision-making.
“You always want to make a play. You want to do something,” Young said. “Obviously, part of the position is being the game manager. Some bad instances of that on film today. I definitely take accountability for that.”
Dalton is 83-78-2 as a starting quarterback in the NFL, including one last season with the Panthers. He has thrown 246 touchdown passes and 144 interceptions since coming into the league in 2011 with Cincinnati.
Dalton said Monday he was surprised by the move, but is excited about the opportunity to start again in the NFL.
“When I came here, I wasn’t sure if I was going to get another opportunity, and so I’m really looking forward to it,” said Dalton, who missed a portion of training camp with a quad injury. “I’m excited about what’s ahead. And, you know, it’s a tough situation. I’ve been on both sides of it, and it’s hard. I mean, it’s hard on everybody, but for me, I mean, I’m looking forward to it.”
Panthers tight end Tommy Tremble said he still feels Young is a great quarterback and said the blame shouldn’t fall all on the QB’s shoulders.
“We haven’t done the best (as teammates) to help him show his ability,” Tremble said. “I’ve seen the flashes and what he does on a daily basis in practice. I think just together as a group I feel bad that we couldn’t show that on Sundays.”

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — The clock struck 0:00 and Shedeur Sanders rolled to his left and let the football fly.
LaJohntay Wester caught the 43-yard Hail Mary pass in the end zone, unleashing bedlam in Boulder on a rainy, storm-the-field kind of night that coach Deion Sanders and the rest of the Colorado football program will soak in for a long time.
The Sanders-Wester connection sent Saturday’s game into overtime, then Travis Hunter embellished his Heisman resume by forcing a Baylor fumble at the goal line to help the Buffs somehow defeat the Bears 38-31 in their wild return to the Big 12.
Even that didn’t end things. Thousands of revved-up and rain-drenched fans stormed the field after the ball rolled out of the end zone. Officials needed to review the play to see if Baylor running back Dominic Richardson had crossed the goal line before the ball popped out.
With the PA announcer urging fans off the gridiron, the refs finally made it official. It was a fumble. And CU was the winner.
“Great, great, great, great, great win,” Deion Sanders said. “These young men were resilient. They never gave up, never surrendered.”
Micah Welch’s short plunge in overtime gave the Buffaloes their first lead since the opening quarter. Then, Baylor got the ball and marched to CU’s 2. Soon after Hunter’s play, the fans rushed the field with the goal post on the far end lowered before officials confirmed the call. 


“I knew they were coming at me,” Hunter said of the last play. “They didn’t think I could tackle, so I had to show them.”
The desperation play for the Buffaloes (3-1, 1-0 Big 12) comes three days shy of the 30th anniversary of the “Miracle at Michigan,” when they beat the Wolverines on Kordell Stewart’s 64-yard Hail Mary to Michael Westbrook. Saturday night’s Fox telecast showed the 1994 play just seconds before Sanders connected with Wester.
Asked where this game ranked, Deion Sanders simply responded: “I don’t rank games. I just love the Ws. By any means necessary. I love ‘em.”
Baylor turned in plenty of big plays, including Jamaal Bell going untouched for a 100-yard kickoff return in the second quarter and, shortly after that, Sawyer Robertson breaking free for a 45-yard TD on fourth-and-1 to put Baylor up by 14.
After the Buffaloes tied it in the third quarter, Hal Presley made a one-handed grab for a 24-yard touchdown with 5:43 remaining to give Baylor (2-2, 0-1) back the lead. The Bears had a chance to secure the win but Isaiah Hankins’ 45-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right. 
It set the stage for one of the more memorable wins in Buffs history — and one of the more crushing losses for the Bears. 
“Heart-wrenching loss,” Baylor coach Dave Aranda said. “Haven’t really been a part of something like that, especially down to the last play of overtime. ... Very hard to take. The team is very is gutted right now, and so frustrated. We’re probably going to be hurting all the way back to Waco.”
Constantly on the move, Sanders threw for 341 yards and two scores. He also ran for a score and was sacked eight times. Hunter finished with seven catches for 130 yards, while also recording three tackles on defense. His play on both sides of the ball has put him in the Heisman conversation.
This should only bolster his case.
“T told me ‘I’m gonna go get a pick,’” Shedeur Sanders said of his conversation with Hunter before the Buffs went on defense in overtime. “I said ‘Make sure you do.’ He went out and made a play that was amazing. That’s stuff T does.”
Omarion Miller made the most of his first catch of the season, snagging a deep pass from Sanders and bouncing away from a tackle — while keeping his knee off the turf. Miller’s 58-yard TD was upheld after review and brought Colorado within 24-17 at halftime.
In the sea of fans, Deion Sanders couldn’t find Aranda on the field after the game. So he went over by the Baylor locker room but didn’t run into Aranda. 
He apologized for missing the handshake.
Speaking of the fan base’s renewed love for CU football, he said: “I don’t like what transpired at the end of the game but I love what transpired at the end of the game.”
Baylor: Altering the late-game defense. Just before Wester’s Hail Mary catch, Will Sheppard got past the Baylor secondary and nearly caught a pass that could’ve resulted in the tying score.
Colorado: The special teams struggled. Not only did Bell turn in a 100-yard kickoff return, the Bears also had a 54-yard punt return. “Special teams was horrible,” Deion Sanders said.
Baylor: Host BYU on Saturday.
Colorado: At Central Florida on Saturday.

NEW YORK (AP) — The court at the nation’s first high school with a curriculum designed around a career in basketball will be named for New York Knicks All-Star Julius Randle.
The announcement was made Wednesday at a groundbreaking ceremony for the new, 69,000-square-foot building in the Bronx that will house the Earl Monroe New Renaissance Basketball School.
Founded in 2021, the tuition-free charter school offers instruction in areas such as sports media, law, medicine and facilities management. Its first class will graduate in 2025.
Randle has been a supporter of the school through his “30 for 3” campaign, where he donates $500 for each 3-pointer he makes. He made 76 last season for $38,000.
That contribution could have been much higher, but Randle sustained a season-ending dislocated shoulder during a Jan. 27 victory over Miami, just days before he was selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the third time in his five seasons in New York.
Randle had surgery in April. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said Wednesday he thinks Randle is healthy as the team prepares to report to training camp on Monday.
Thibodeau took part in the ceremony along with Knicks Hall of Famers Monroe and Walt Frazier, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and others. After Randle spoke, he was told that the school’s basketball teams would play on the Julius Randle All-Star Court.
Randle’s contributions have helped raise more than $1.3 million for the school, which was created by filmmaker Dan Klores and had former NBA Commissioner David Stern, who died in 2020, as its first trustee.
Thibodeau praised Randle for remaining available to the students.
“When you see that commitment and his support and his involvement, that’s what makes it special,” Thibodeau said.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Evan Engram sustained a hamstring injury during pregame warmups Sunday and was ruled out an hour before kickoff against Cleveland.
Engram was apparently injured after the team submitted its inactive list. Without him, second-year pro Brenton Strange is expected to see more playing time.
Engram caught a career-high 114 passes for 963 yards and four touchdowns last season. He had one reception for 5 yards in the season opener at Miami.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Maya Rudolph won her sixth career Emmy on Saturday night, taking the trophy for best character voice-over for her work on “Big Mouth” at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, while Angela Bassett won her first for her narration of the National Geographic show “Queens.” 
The former and future “Saturday Night Live” star Rudolph is up for three more Emmys. Her voice-over work as the Hormone Monstress on the Netflix animated show “Big Mouth” has earned her four of her Emmys.
“I’m really proud to be a part of this show,” she said. “It humanizes being human.”
She got emotional when as she talked about the privilege that she gets to do what she loves in her life.
“It’s making me cry because I’m very menopausal,” Rudolph said. 
She won on the first of the two-night Creative Arts Emmys, which honor behind-the-scenes artistic and technical achievement in television and are a precursor to the main Emmys ceremony, hosted by Dan and Eugene Levy, that will air at 8 p.m. EST Sept. 15 on ABC.
Bassett appeared to collect her trophy for best narrator, a category that is usually star studded but where the winner, like Barack Obama last year, rarely shows. 
“Oh my god, wow, my first Emmy,” an emotional Bassett said. “I couldn’t be more thrilled and more grateful.”
Bassett was attracted to the wildlife documentary project because of the all female-led production team, a rarity in the medium, she said backstage.


“It just touched my heart,” she said. “So I said yes.”
Bassett is a two-time Oscar nominee who won an honorary Academy Award earlier this year. 
Other winners included the recently retired Pat Sajak, who won best game show host for his final season on “Wheel of Fortune.” It was his fourth time winning the award, and first time since 1998. 
“Saturday Night Live” thrived in the craft categories with six wins, including victories for its makeup and production design. 
Rudolph won two Emmys when she was a cast member on the show, and is nominated for two more for her work as host of the sketch institution last season. Those will be awarded Sunday. 
She will be returning this fall to play Vice President Kamala Harris on the 50th season of “SNL” in the weeks leading up to the election. 
“I feel like I am connected somehow to an incredible time in this country and an excitement that I haven’t felt in a long time,” she said backstage on Saturday. 
She is also nominated at the main Emmys ceremony for best actress in a comedy for her Apple TV+ series “Loot.” She is a longshot for that award, where the favorites are Jean Smart for “Hacks” and Ayo Edebiri for “The Bear,” which leads all shows in the comedy category with 23 nominations. 
The Ron Howard-directed documentary “Jim Henson Idea Man” won four times and “Welcome to Wrexham” won three including best unstructured reality show. “Shark Tank” won best structured reality show. In an awards show crossover, the telecast of the Oscars won four Emmys including best live variety special.
Dick Van Dyke, who turns 99 next month, may have stolen the show when “Dick Van Dyke 98 Years Of Magic” won best pre-recorded variety special. 
Van Dyke did a little dance and announced “that hurt” afterward. As the winners were being played off stage, he said, “I’d like to take this opportunity to invite you to my memorial. I don’t have a date yet but I’m not feeling very well.” 
Van Dyke became the oldest person to get a daytime Emmy when he won in June for appearing on “Days of Our Lives.”
The season’s top overall nominee, “Shogun,” got a win of sorts Saturday when the team that puts together the post-show making of featurette took home an Emmy. The FX series itself is up for 25 Emmys. Seventeen of those will be handed out on Sunday, which focuses on scripted television. 
Plenty of big names are also up for Creative Arts Emmys on Sunday, including Oscar winners Jamie Lee Curtis and Da’Vine Joy Randolph and Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling.

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) — Pope Francis called sexual abuse “demonic” on Friday as he weighed in on the latest sex assault revelations against a legendary French priest, Abbe Pierre, who devoted his life to advocating for the homeless.
Abbé Pierre, who died in 2007, was one of France’s most beloved public figures. The founder of the international Emmaus Community for the poor, Abbé Pierre had served as part of France’s conscience since the 1950s, when he persuaded Parliament to pass a law — still on the books — forbidding landlords to evict tenants during winter.
Emmaus International this week revealed that it had substantiated 17 more claims against its late founder, adding to the seven that were made public in July when it revealed the claims amounted to “sexual assault or sexual harassment.” The scandal set off outrage among French Catholics, for whom Abbe Pierre was a hero and icon.
Francis was asked during an in-flight press conference coming home from Asia about what the Vatican knew and when about Abbe Pierre, given reports that at least some people close to him knew of his impulsive sexual behavior.
Francis said he didn’t know when exactly the Holy See had learned about his abuse, but that it was after he had died.
He called Abbe Pierre a “terrible sinner” but that such a “shameful crime” was also the “human condition.”
“He’s a man who did so much good, but he’s also a sinner. We have to speak clearly about these things, and not hide them,” he said. “Abuse is in my judgment is something demonic, because every type of abuse destroys the dignity of the person.”


According to Emmaus, the new 17 cases involve women who reported behavior similar to that reported by the first seven victims, extending the abuse allegations from 1950s and 2000s. Their claims involved “unsolicited breast touching and forced kisses,” as well as repeated sexual contact with a vulnerable person, sexual penetration with an adult woman and sexual contact with a child, according to Emmaus.
The case of Abbe Pierre is the latest involving a revered, charismatic Catholic leader who turns out to have been a sexual predator. It is similar in some ways to the scandal involving another French icon, Jean Vanier, who founded the L’Arche movement to care for people with disabilities and was later found to have engaged in misconduct with adult women.
Francis had to confront a similar case during his visit to East Timor. Timorese Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo won the Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign for independence, but the Vatican revealed in 2022 that he had been sanctioned for sexually abusing young boys. Belo was allowed by St. John Paul II to retire quietly in 2002, and the Holy See has never revealed what it knew and when about his crimes.
Francis didn’t mention Belo by name while he was in East Timor, where Belo is still revered and many Timorese refuse to believe he was an abuser. But Francis did condemn “abuse” in general terms upon arrival in Dili.
Emmaus and the Abbe Pierre Foundation announced a series of steps to distance themselves from their founder, including changes to the foundation’s name and Emmaus logos and closing a memorial dedicated to the priest.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado tried to reassure supporters Monday that her coalition still hopes to gain control of the presidency despite the departure into exile of their candidate Edmundo González Urrutia. 

Machado’s group maintains that it has evidence that González won the July 28 presidential election by a wide margin against Venezuela’s authoritarian incumbent president, Nicolás Maduro, despite his claim to have won. 

Machado told an online meeting Monday of opposition leaders, reporters and others that her group still hopes to see Maduro leave office in January, even if for voters those hopes seem increasingly tenuous since González’s decision to flee into exile to Spain over the weekend.

She said the former diplomat could fulfill the role of opposition candidate “with much greater protection and security” from abroad. She herself has gone into hiding in the weeks since the election, while Maduro’s government has arrested more than 2,000 people and cracked down on demonstrations throughout the country protesting the election results.
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024

“Nothing has changed,” she insisted from an undisclosed location in Venezuela. 

González, 75, landed Sunday at a military airport near Madrid, accompanied by his wife and Spanish officials. His departure was announced late Saturday by Venezuela’s government, which days earlier had ordered his arrest.

González had not been seen publicly since the week after the vote, when he and Machado announced not only that their campaign had obtained vote tallies from over two-thirds of the electronic voting machines used in the election but also that they had published them online to show the world that Maduro had lost the contest.



Their assertions stunned supporters and critics alike, because the National Electoral Council had declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed, giving him a third six-year term set to begin on Jan. 10. The panel, stacked with ruling party loyalists, never released detailed vote tallies to support Maduro’s claim to victory.

González had never run for office before the presidential election. The leadership of the Unitary Platform opposition coalition chose him as candidate after the government banned Machado from running for office and did not allow her hand-picked successor to register for the contest.

Machado became his key surrogate, and they campaigned together.

González said in a statement Monday that he is not motived by “personal ambition.” He wrote that he remains committed to “the realization of the popular will,” but he did not explain how he intends to continue to work toward that goal.

“My commitment is not based on personal ambition, this decision is a gesture that reaches out to everyone, and I hope that it will be reciprocated as such,” González said.



 Machado told reporters that González is “Venezuela’s president-elect” regardless of his location and will remain so “until the day he is sworn in as president.” She did not offer any details of the strategy that could lead to that result.

Experts from the United Nations and the Carter Center, which at the invitation of Maduro’s government observed the election, determined the results announced by electoral authorities lacked credibility. 

In a statement critical of the election, the U.N. experts stopped short of validating the opposition’s claim to victory, but they said the faction’s voting records published online appear to exhibit all of the original security features.",False

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Damar Hamlin wouldn’t — just couldn’t — let go of the ball as he was mobbed by teammates when the Bills safety finally reached Buffalo’s sideline.
It wasn’t lost on him that his first career interception came during a Monday night outing some 21 months after he went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati on a Monday night in January 2022.
“We all know my last game and how that game went,” Hamlin said following a 47-10 win over Jacksonville. “So to be able to come all the way back from that, and have a special moment, it’s all God.”
Hamlin was in perfect position to pick off Trevor Lawrence’s overthrown pass intended for Brian Thomas Jr. in the second quarter. Catching the ball at Buffalo’s 41, he worked his way across the field for a 19-yard return.
Upon celebrating the pick, Hamlin gripped the ball tightly in making his way to Buffalo’s bench.
“They were a big part of me being able to make this type of comeback. They pushed me. They gave me love. They gave me grace. They gave me everything I needed on the journey,” Hamlin said, referring to his teammates. “And they were even happier than I was to get my first interception. But that just shows the community and the bond that we have here in Buffalo.”
Hamlin’s lengthy recovery and bid to resume playing began in April 2023, when he was cleared to practice with doctors assuring him the chances of a recurrence being slim. He was gradually eased back in dealing with his first practice, his first practice in pads, his first preseason game, before making the Bills roster in a backup role.


With last year behind him, the 26-year-old shed whatever trepidations he had and secured a starting spot in a retooled secondary that has Hamlin playing alongside Taylor Rapp.

“What a night for Damar,” coach Sean McDermott said. “The journey that he’s been on, and how he’s persevered.”
The interception set up Josh Allen’s 27-yard touchdown pass to Khalil Shakir to put Buffalo up 27-3 with 2:04 remaining in the half.
“There are no words for it, man,” said Hamlin, a sixth-round 2021 draft pick out of Pittsburgh, where he also grew up. I’m still processing that as I go, but I was able to take it one day at a time.”

IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Kyle Konrardy made a 54-yard field goal with six seconds left to give Iowa State a 20-19 victory over No. 21 Iowa on Saturday, only the Cyclones’ third victory in the last 11 games against the Hawkeyes.
Konrardy, who had missed a 41-yard field-goal attempt in the second quarter, got his chance when the Cyclones (2-0) drove 42 yards on three pass completions from quarterback Rocco Becht after getting the ball at their own 22 with 34 seconds remaining.
“You’ve got to focus, not on the mistakes, but focus on what’s next,” Konrardy said. “Part of it was just not even think about the mistake, but focus on what I could do now.”
The key, Konrardy said, was “not think.”
“That’s it,” he said. “Just go out there and not think and just do what you do.”
Asked if he was able to do that, Konrardy smiled and said, “Yes sir.”
“It’s just like practice,” Becht said. “He hits those all of the time in practice. He has no doubt.”
Iowa (1-1) got a 35-yard return from Max White on the ensuing kickoff and had time for one play, but Cade McNamara’s pass was intercepted by Darien Porter.
The Hawkeyes led 19-7 with 4:47 left in the third quarter after Kaleb Johnson’s 4-yard touchdown run. McNamara’s two-point conversion pass was incomplete, a play that proved to be important at the end.
“I felt like we were teetering on the edge the whole time,” Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said.


But the Cyclones rallied, with Becht throwing a 75-yard touchdown pass to Jaylin Noel late in the third quarter and Konrardy adding a 46-yard field goal early in the fourth.
“The real win is when you see young men respond to adversity,” Campbell said. “Life is going to be hard. There’s going to be tough moments. But you have to respond to adversity.”
Johnson, who rushed for 187 yards, opened the scoring for Iowa with a 27-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. The Hawkeyes led 13-0 at halftime, but they squandered chances to get more points in the first half. They had first-and-goal at the Iowa State 1 early in the second quarter, and another first-and-goal situation at the 3 in the quarter, but only came away with two field goals from Drew Stevens.
“I really felt that was the game,” Campbell said. “When we were able to make those stands down there, I thought, man, we can get the momentum going our way in the second half.”
The Cyclones outgained the Hawkeyes 361-303.
“Today, the bigger issue is not at least getting one touchdown on those field-goal opportunities, when we had the ball down near their goal line,” Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. “Obviously, that’s an area we’re going to have to improve on.”
 Becht, who had a 3-yard touchdown pass to Jayden Higgins early in the third quarter to start Iowa State’s scoring, threw for 272 yards. Noel had five catches for 133 yards.
“We expanded a little bit more,” Becht said about the play-calling. “We wanted to be more aggressive in the second half.”
Iowa had 204 rushing yards. McNamara was 13 of 28 for 99 yards.
The Hawkeyes had a chance to take control of the game early, but couldn’t get more points out of those drives deep into Cyclone territory. That left the game in the hands of Iowa’s defense, which kept Iowa State contained until that final drive.
It took a while before Iowa State’s defense finally had an answer for Iowa in the second half. The Cyclones held Iowa to just 15 yards on four possessions after cutting the lead to 19-17, but couldn’t get anything going against Iowa’s defense until the closing drive.

Key points
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point, a dramatic shift after more than two years of high rates that helped tame inflation but also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers.
The rate cut, the Fed’s first in more than four years, reflects its new focus on bolstering the job market, which has shown clear signs of slowing. Coming just weeks before the presidential election, the Fed’s move also has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as Americans prepare to vote. 
The central bank’s action lowered its key rate to roughly 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months as it struggled to curb the worst inflation streak in four decades. Inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to a three-year low of 2.5% in August, not far above the Fed’s 2% target.
The Fed’s policymakers also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate by an additional half-point in their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026.
In a statement and in a news conference with Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed came closer than it has before to declaring victory over inflation.
“We know it is time to recalibrate our (interest rate) policy to something that’s more appropriate given the progress on inflation,” Powell said. “We’re not saying, ‘mission accomplished’ ... but I have to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.”




“The U.S. economy is in a good place,” he added, “and our decision today is designed to keep it there.”
Though the central bank now believes inflation is largely defeated, many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas, rent and other necessities. Former President Donald Trump blames the Biden-Harris administration for sparking an inflationary surge. Vice President Kamala Harris, in turn, has charged that Trump’s promise to slap tariffs on all imports would raise prices for consumers even further.
Rate cuts by the Fed should, over time, lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, boosting Americans’ finances and supporting more spending and growth. Homeowners will be able to refinance mortgages at lower rates, saving on monthly payments, and even shift credit card debt to lower-cost personal loans or home equity lines. Businesses may also borrow and invest more. Average mortgage rates have already dropped to an 18-month low of 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, spurring a jump in demand for refinancings. 
“It’s a step in the right direction,” Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said of Wednesday’s Fed move. 
The additional rate cuts it indicated it will make, she said, will “prevent risks from building and the unemployment rate from rising. They are trying to keep the economy in good shape.”
In an updated set of projections, the policymakers collectively envision a faster drop in inflation than they did three months ago but also higher unemployment. They foresee their preferred inflation gauge falling to 2.3% by year’s end, from its current 2.5%, and to 2.1% by the end of 2025. And they now expect the unemployment rate to rise further this year, to 4.4%, from 4.2% now, and to remain there by the end of 2025. That’s above their previous forecasts of 4% for the end of this year and 4.2% for 2025.
Powell was pressed at his news conference about whether the Fed’s decision to cut its key rate by an unusually large half-point is an acknowledgement that it waited too long to begin reducing borrowing rates.
“We don’t think we’re behind,” he replied. “We think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind. We’re not seeing rising (unemployment) claims, not seeing rising layoffs, not hearing from companies that that’s something that’s going to happen.”
He added: “There is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it’s strong and not when you begin to see the layoffs. We don’t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2%.”
The Fed’s next policy meeting is Nov. 6-7 — immediately after the presidential election. By cutting rates this week, soon before the election, the Fed is risking attacks from Trump, who has argued that lowering rates now amounts to political interference. Yet Politico has reported that even some key Senate Republicans who were interviewed expressed support for a Fed rate cut this week.
Powell pushed back against any suggestion that the Fed shouldn’t cut rates so close to an election.
“We’re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue,” he said. “It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that’s how the other central banks are set up, too. It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public, and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.”
Powell’s characterization of the economy as fundamentally healthy, with inflation under control and employment stable but likely to benefit from rate cuts was an unspoken rebuttal to Trump’s warnings that an economic disaster is near.
The Fed’s move Wednesday reverses the inflation-fighting effort it engineered by raising its key rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Wage growth has since slowed, removing a potential source of inflationary pressure. And oil and gas prices are falling, a sign that inflation should continue to cool in the months ahead. Consumers are also pushing back against high prices, forcing such companies as Target and McDonald’s to dangle deals and discounts. 
The Fed’s decision drew the first dissent from a member of its governing board since 2005. Michelle Bowman, a board member who has expressed concern in the past that inflation had not been fully defeated, said she would have preferred a quarter-point rate cut.
But the Fed’s policymakers as a whole appear to recognize that after years of strong job growth, employers have slowed hiring, and the unemployment rate has risen nearly a full percentage point from its half-century low in April 2023 to a still-low 4.2%. Once unemployment rises that much, it tends to keep climbing. 
At the same time, the officials and many economists have noted that the rise in unemployment this time largely reflects an influx of people seeking jobs — notably new immigrants and recent college graduates — rather than layoffs. 
The Fed’s attention now is “preserving the health of the labor market and preventing unnecessary damage to the economy from a pretty restrictive (interest rate) stance,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag questioned his players’ killer instinct after they were held to a 1-1 draw by his old club FC Twente in the revamped Europa League on Wednesday.
Sam Lammers capitalized on a mistake by Christian Eriksen in the second half at Old Trafford and raced away to fire an equalizer for the Dutch underdog.
“You saw that was the game of their life. They fought for every yard and we didn’t,” Ten Hag said. “99% is not enough, You have to give 100%. You have kill the game. You have to finish it off.” 
Eriksen had put United ahead with a stunning first-half strike but was caught in possession by Lammers, whose goal secured an unexpected point for the visitors.
Ten Hag had spoken before the game of his affection for the team he supported as a boy in the Netherlands and represented as a player. He said it was “not nice to have to hurt something you love.”
Instead it was United fans left in pain, despite Eriksen seemingly putting the home team on course for victory.
United has won just three of seven games in all competitions this season and Wednesday’s draw came after a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday.
Eriksen swept United ahead in the 35th with a first-time shot into the top corner. Connecting with a loose ball just inside the box, the playmaker didn’t break stride as he whipped his effort past past Twente goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with power and precision.


With one fist clenched, he ran to the corner to celebrate in front of the home fans.
But it was Twente’s supporters left cheering the loudest after Lammers’ goal in the 68th when beating Andre Onana at his near post.
“There’s a lot of football (still to play) when you (are) one up and the game takes more than 90 minutes,” Ten Hag said. “And you have to fight until the end and score the second goal.”
Like the Champions League, the second-tier Europa League has a new format and 36 teams instead of 32. It features a league system in which each team plays eight games against different opponents through January, replacing the old group stage.
In a clash between the Turkish and Greek champions, Galatasaray beat PAOK 3-1. Victor Osimhen, who moved from Napoli to Galatasaray earlier in September, made his presence felt. The Nigeria striker’s goalbound header was deflected by defender Abdul Rahman Baba into his own net early in the second half. Giannis Konstantelias equalized on a rebound before Osimhen set up Yunus Akgün to net the winner. Mauro Icardi added a stoppage-time goal.
Lazio cruised past Dynamo Kyiv 3-0. Boulaye Dia struck twice and Fisayo Dele-Bashiru added one. Both teams ended the game with 10 men.
Real Sociedad, struggling in La Liga, got a goal from Ander Barrenetxea at Nice but the home team salvaged a 1-1 draw thanks to Pablo Rosario’s goal late in the first half.
Another team struggling domestically, Bundesliga’s Hoffenheim took home a point from Denmark in a 1-1 draw with Danish Superliga’s leader Midtjylland. Darío Osorio put the hosts ahead late in the first half before substitute Max Moerstedt leveled it in the final minute.
In Brussels, Anderlecht struck twice in the span of five minutes in the second half on the way to a 2-1 victory over Ferencváros. Yari Verschaeren scored on the hour and Kasper Dolberg added the second from the spot.
Slavia Prague scored in each half for a 2-0 win at Bulgaria’s Ludogorets.
Norwegian club Bodø/Glimt and Dutch side AZ Alkmaar became the first teams to claim victories earlier on Wednesday.
Jens Petter Hauge’s two goals guided 10-man Bodø/Glimt from a goal down to a 3-2 win over Porto while Troy Parrott netted the winner from the penalty spot for Alkmaar to beat Sweden’s Elfsborg 3-2.
Porto, a two-time champion in Europe’s second-tier league, got an early goal from Samu. Kasper Høgh’s equalized and Hauge netted twice for a 3-1 lead. Porto reduce the deficit to one in the final minute through substitute Deniz Gül.
Alkmaar answered Timothy Ouma’s opener with two goals from Ruben van Bommel on both sides of the interval. Simon Hedlund made it 2-2 before Parrott’s late penalty.
Ahead of a late game between Dynamo Kyiv and Lazio, a group of about 60 Lazio fans were stopped by German authorities in Hamburg after attempting to avoid a police escort and were found to be carrying knives, clubs and other weapons. Fans who were held overnight were banned from attending Wednesday’s game but there were no arrests.
Dynamo plays its home Europa League games in Hamburg because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The full impact of Hurricane Helene won’t be known for weeks, but groups from both the public and private sector are mobilizing efforts to help those affected by the Category 4 storm that has killed at least 120 people and already caused billions in damage.
If you want to help, experts say:
— Cash is king. Many groups providing aid will only accept cash donations because the needs are not fully known and it does not require additional resources to get the donations to those in need. Food and clothing drives may be helpful later in the process in specific communities, but it can divert manpower to connect the right people with the right items.
— Give to charities already working in the area. Because damage from Helene is spread out over six states in an area that reaches from Florida’s Big Bend to the Appalachians in Virginia, experts say to look for groups with a history of aid in the specific city or state you want to help so that your donation reaches your intended area more quickly. If you want suggestions, Charity Navigator and GoFundMe have curated lists of organizations and people in the affected areas,
— Look for matching donations. Nonprofits recognize that individuals may not be able to give as much as they would like due to the current economy and the number of current global crises. Experts suggest giving through places that will provide a matching donation. For example, Walmart announced Monday that its foundation will not only donate $6 million to support Hurricane Helene relief efforts, but it will match all customer donations made to the American Red Cross at Walmart and Sam’s Club stores, as well as Walmart.com, until Oct. 13, up to $2.5 million.
— Consider waiting. Rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Helene will take months, if not years, and the full picture of need is not available yet, experts say. They say that following disasters donations start out strong following the event and then slow down when it is no longer top of mind, even though that’s when the need made be growing when government benefits expire.

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Quali Conley ran for 112 yards, Noah Fifita threw for 173 yards and a touchdown and No. 20 Arizona overcame a four-point halftime deficit to beat Northern Arizona 22-10 on Saturday night to match the school record with its ninth consecutive victory.
The Wildcats (2-0) extended the longest active winning streak in FBS by outscoring the Lumberjacks 16-0 in the second half after trailing 10-6 at the break. The nine straight wins matches the school record set in 1974-75 and matched in 1997-98.
“I was really happy with the response, especially coming out of halftime down 10-6,” Arizona coach Brent Brennan said. “Some good team football. I give credit to Northern Arizona, I thought their players played their butts off and their coaches did a great job.”
Conley, a transfer from San Jose State, led the way as Arizona gained 188 yards on the ground. Receiver Tetairoa McMillan, who had a school-record 304 yards and four TDs in a 61-39 season-opening win over New Mexico, was limited to two catches for 11 yards.
“They did push the coverage to him at times,” Brennan said about defending McMillan. “They did a good job, they doubled him some, they bracketed him some.”
Northern Arizona (1-1) finished with only 198 yards of total offense, 91 after halftime. Ty Pennington threw for 84 yards on 14 of 24 passing and added 39 on the ground.
Arizona forced a turnover on downs in Northern Arizona territory to open the second half and converted that into points as Jeremiah Patterson scored on a 17-yard touchdown pass from Fifita for a 13-10 lead with 12:06 left in the third.


The Wildcats’ Chubba Ma’ae tackled running back Darvon Hubbard in the end zone for a safety with 11:33 left in the fourth, upping the lead to 15-10. And after getting the ball back, Arizona made it 22-10 on a 56-yard scoring run by Kedrick Reescano with 9:32 remaining.
Arizona only led 3-0 after the first quarter after settling for a red zone field goal on its first drive and punting the next two. Northern Arizona took a 7-3 lead with 10:24 left in the half on a trick play, with receiver Isaiah Eastman throwing a 25-yard TD pass to tight end Xander Werner.
Fifita’s interception led to more points for the Lumberjacks, with Marcus Lye converting on a 38-yard field goal to make it 10-3 with 6:20 left in the first half.
The Wildcats cut Northern Arizona’s lead to 10-6 with 32 seconds left in the first half on a 48-yard field goal from Tyler Loop. 
Northern Arizona: The Lumberjacks, who shocked Arizona in Tucson in 2021, dropped to 10-55 against FBS schools. They have never beaten a ranked FBS opponent.
Arizona: A week after scoring on 10 drives and putting up the eighth-most yards in school history, the Wildcats had fewer yards in the first half (147) than on their first two drives in the Week 1 win over New Mexico.
Northern Arizona: At Utah Tech on Saturday.
Arizona: At Kansas State on Friday night in a nonconference game scheduled before the Wildcats left the Pac-12 for the Big 12.

BRISTOL, England (AP) — The rain arrived too late for England as Australia won the deciding fifth one-day international to clinch the series 3-2 on Sunday.
Australia finished on 165-2 in 20.4 overs, appearing to be comfortably on track to reaching the original winning target of 310 before rain stopped play at Bristol’s County Ground. No further play was possible and Australia won by 49 runs under the DLS method which sets revised targets for interrupted cricket matches.
Australia struggled with injuries and illness during the series, and fielded a different starting lineup in each game and a stand-in captain — Steve Smith — in the decider when Mitch Marsh withdrew because of soreness.
“It’s certainly been a tricky series,” Marsh said. “But it’s just the calmness, our ability to stay present with the XIs we put out, that impressed me.”
The teams entered the game tied at 2-2 and the match would have been abandoned as a no-result, with the series ending 2-2, if Australia had not batted for 20 overs — the minimum for a win to be declared. 
England could have stretched out the innings further had it not bowled four overs of spin but Harry Brook insisted his overriding ambition was on making inroads into the batting of Australia.
Brook saw the positives from an entertaining series.
“We’ve got a lot of positives to take away from that,” said Brook, who filled in as England captain for the injured Jos Buttler in this series.


“They’re the best team in the world and we’re playing against some of the best bowlers and batters to have ever played the game.”
Australia raced to 103-1 after only 10 overs, losing Travis Head to Brydon Carse for 31. Matthew Short’s 58 off 30 balls got Australia ahead of the run rate and, despite apparent stalling tactics from England as the 20-over mark hovered into view, Australia eased to the series win.
Steve Smith was 36 not out, with Josh Inglis undefeated on 28 when stumps was called.
Ben Duckett earlier hit 107 in 91 balls and Brook contributed a 52-ball 72 with seven sixes in England’s 309 all out in 49.2 overs after losing the toss and having to bat first.
England was on course for a huge total before Brook holed out to Adam Zampa, after hitting him for five sixes, sparking a collapse from 202-2 in the 25th over. Liam Livingstone, who launched a brutal onslaught against Australia in England’s 186-run win in the fourth ODI at Lord’s, was this time caught behind off Zampa for a three-ball duck.
Duckett was one of four wickets to fall to Head, the fifth spinner Australia used, on a wearing pitch. Head took 4-28 in 6.2 overs, and Aaron Hardie, Zampa and Glenn Maxwell took two wickets each.
Australia, the World Cup champion in the 50-over format, had a 14-game winning streak ended when England won the third game of this series to keep it alive.

Publication date:2024-09-15 07:00:00

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence trudged through the hallway, walked into the locker room and slapped a laundry bin. He briefly stopped at his stall and then made a beeline for veteran center Mitch Morse.
They had a lot to discuss. It may have been the first step toward Lawrence fixing the team’s woeful offense.
Lawrence and the Jaguars were baffled for the second time in as many weeks. Lawrence completed 14 of 30 passes for 220 yards in an 18-13 loss to the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. He was sacked four times, including once for a late safety, and vented his frustration following the team’s seventh loss in its last eight games.
“We suck right now, so I’m pretty shocked,” said Lawrence, who has dropped his last seven NFL starts and gone a career-long 294 days since his last victory. “We’ve got to figure it out. … Everybody has got to take accountability, look in the mirror and fix it. I’ve got to play better. I’m the leader of this offense. It’s on me.”
The Jaguars (0-2) finished with 323 yards, but 210 of those came on their final four drives. Before that, Lawrence and the Jaguars had third-down woes, communication issues that caused them to burn two timeouts and even a bickering exchange between Lawrence and coach Doug Pederson on the sideline.
“We’re on the same page,” Lawrence insisted.
No one who’s watched the Jaguars the first two games would agree.


They got off to a strong start at Miami last week and were about to pull ahead 24-7 late in the third quarter when Travis Etienne fumbled near the goal line. Jacksonville has mostly stumbled since.
Between the second half against the Dolphins and the first half Sunday, the Jaguars managed 186 yards, three points and two third-down conversions in 10 tries.

“We’ve got to take charge,” Lawrence said. “We’re standing around waiting on somebody to make a play. … We’ve got to find a rhythm as an offense. Too many good players to perform like that, really the last two weeks.”
While Lawrence and Morse were discussing issues in the locker room, Pederson and owner Shad Khan were behind closed doors down the hall. Khan made it clear before the season that “winning now” is his expectation.
Jacksonville’s revamped defense allowed 20 and 18 points in the losses. The offense, meanwhile, has been downright pedestrian while Pederson and offensive coordinator Press Taylor continue to hide which one of them is really calling plays.
“I’m at a loss because we’ve been together for a while now,” Pederson said of his Year 3 team. “We shouldn’t be playing the way we’re playing. We shouldn’t be coaching the way we’re coaching. I take accountability there. It starts with me. Then it goes to the assistant coaches and players. I just know that we’re a better football team than what we played today.”
Lawrence has 26 completions in two games and has been sacked seven times. Etienne has 96 yards rushing. Christian Kirk has two catches for 29 yards. Tight end Evan Engram has one reception and was ruled out an hour before kickoff Sunday after straining a hamstring in warmups.
“I don’t think you hit the panic button,” Pederson said. “There’s a long season ahead. We’ve got to figure some things out in a hurry. We’ve got to coach some things and do some things. Each person has to look at themselves in the mirror, me included.
“We’ve got to do better. It’s disappointing. It’s disappointing because there’s glimpses of greatness out there, but it’s not consistent enough.”
Jacksonville could easily be 2-0 heading to Buffalo for a Monday night game had the offense pulled its weight. The Jaguars went 1 of 4 in the red zone against Cleveland a week after fumbling away a touchdown.
“We’ve got to be honest with ourselves, and if you don’t like it and if you made a mistake and you don’t like people calling it out and talking about it, you need to find a different job because this isn’t the one,” Lawrence said. “Things matter. Little details matter. … You look back at it, and all those plays add up and they affect the game, and you end up losing.”

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly adopted a “Pact for the Future” to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Now comes the hard part: uniting the world’s divided nations to move quickly to implement the agreement’s 56 actions.
As Czech President Petr Pavel put it Monday at the summit meeting surrounding the pact: “Our work begins at home.” 
The 193-member world body approved the pact Sunday. The document is meant to link nations in tackling challenges ranging from climate change and artificial intelligence to escalating conflicts and increasing inequality and poverty — and improve the lives of the world’s more than 8 billion people.
The 42-page pact was adopted at Sunday’s opening of a two-day “Summit of the Future,” which continued Monday as leaders of many countries gave their views on the challenges facing the world. 
And with those remarks, the leaders previewed some themes to expect at the assembly’s big annual meeting, which gets into full gear Tuesday. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for technology regulation that’s global but “ensures that national sovereignty and integrity are upheld.” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated his country’s frequent complaints about nations dividing into geopolitical blocs, and about countries singlehandedly imposing sanctions.
Leaders from countries ranging from Angola to Ecuador to Slovakia mentioned a roster of other challenges: inequality, youth unemployment, the spread of disinformation, and more.


Right up to Sunday’s vote, it was unclear whether the pact would be adopted. In fact, there was so much suspense that U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres had three prepared speeches, one for approval, one for rejection, and one if things weren’t clear, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minster Sergey Vershinin proposed an amendment that would have significantly watered down the agreement. “No one is happy with this pact,” he said.
It turned out he was wrong. Some 143 countries, including Africa’s 54 nations, voted not to take action on Russia’s amendment. Only six countries supported Russia -- Iran, Belarus, North Korea, Nicaragua, Sudan and Syria. Fifteen countries abstained.
Assembly President Philémon Yang then put the pact to a vote and banged his gavel, signifying the consensus of all U.N. member nations that was required for approval — to vigorous applause.
Russia has made significant inroads in Africa, in countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Central African Republic. The rejection of Russia’s amendments by African countries and Mexico, a major Latin American power, was seen as a blow to Moscow by some diplomats and observers. 
Vershinin complained at the summit Monday that the pact contains some “unacceptable elements.” His country wants “to disassociate ourselves from the consensus” on it, he said.
He spoke about an hour before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who referred to Russia and supporters of its proposed amendment as “accomplices” in opposing efforts to make the U.N. more effective. 
Guterres, clearly relieved by the pact’s approval, then issued a challenge to the leaders: Implement the pact. Prioritize dialogue and negotiations. End “wars tearing our world apart” from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan. Reform the powerful U.N. Security Council. Accelerate changes to the international financial system. Ramp up a transition from fossil fuels. Listen to young people and include them in decision-making.
For all the endorsements of the agreement, some speakers noted shortcomings. 
The Marshall Islands’ president, Hilda Heine, said it’s “hard not to be frustrated over apparent political limitations” in the pact. 
“There is an incredible and persistent gap between ambitious solutions and international finance at hand,” she said.
Speaking for the U.N.’s main bloc of developing countries — the Group of 77, which now has 134 members, including China — Ugandan Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja regretted that the pact doesn’t recognize actions that developed countries should take to close the widening gaps between them and developing countries.
In a rare move at a high-level U.N. meeting where leaders often exceed the announced time limit, speeches were muted after five minutes. 
The Pact for the Future says world leaders are gathering “at a time of profound global transformation,” and it warns of “rising catastrophic and existential risks” that could tip people everywhere “into a future of persistent crisis and breakdown.”
Guterres singled out a number of key provisions in the pact and its accompanying annexes, a Global Digital Compact and Declaration on Future Generations.
The pact commits world leaders to reform the 15-member Security Council, to make it more reflective of today’s world and “redress the historical injustice against Africa,” which has no permanent seat, and to address the under-representation of the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America.
It also “represents the first agreed multilateral support for nuclear disarmament in more than a decade,” Guterres said, and it commits “to steps to prevent an arms race in outer space and to govern the use of lethal autonomous weapons.”
The Global Digital Compact “includes the first truly universal agreement on the international governance of artificial intelligence,” the U.N. chief said.
As for human rights, Guterres said, “in the face of a surge in misogyny and a rollback of women’s reproductive rights,” the document commits governments to removing legal, social and economic barriers facing women and girls.

The club issued the statement after Mir’s arrest was reported by Spanish media. The club said “it is aware of said arrest” and it would collaborate with authorities.
Spanish media reports Mir was arrested by the Civil Guard in Valencia after an accusation by his supposed victim, a woman.
Mir, aged 27, joined Valencia this season on loan from fellow Spanish club Sevilla.

NEW YORK (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday vowed to carry out “full force” strikes against Hezbollah until it ceases firing rockets across the border, dimming hopes for a cease-fire proposal put forth by U.S. and European officials.
Israel carried out a new strike in the Lebanese capital, which killed a senior Hezbollah commander, and the militant group launched dozens of rockets into Israel. Tens of thousands of Israeli and Lebanese people living near their countries’ border have been displaced by the fighting.
Netanyahu spoke as he arrived in New York to attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, where U.S. and European officials were putting heavy pressure on both sides of the conflict to accept a proposed 21-day halt in the fighting to give time for diplomacy and avert all-out war.
Nearly 700 people have been killed in Lebanon this week as Israel dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting the military capacity of Hezbollah — the Iranian-backed Shiite group that is the strongest armed force in Lebanon. Israeli leaders say they are determined to stop the group’s cross-border attacks, which began after the Hamas militant group’s Oct. 7 attack that ignited the war in Gaza.
Israel’s “policy is clear,” Netanyahu said. “We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force. And we will not stop until we reach all our goals, chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.”


Later, the prime minister’s office said in a statement that Israel and U.S. officials met Thursday to discuss the cease-fire proposal and would continue talks in coming days.
One of Israel’s latest airstrikes killed a Hezbollah drone commander, Mohammed Hussein Surour, in the suburbs of Beirut. Israel’s military announced the death, which Hezbollah later confirmed.
The Health Ministry said two people were killed and 15 wounded in the strike. Associated Press photos of the scene showed a gutted apartment in a residential building in Dahiyeh, the mainly Shiite suburb where Hezbollah has a strong presence.
Until recently, Israel had rarely targeted sites in Beirut during the low-level conflict with Hezbollah that began in October. But it has struck Beirut’s southern suburbs several times this week. Several strikes in Beirut targeted senior Hezbollah commanders. One strike in eastern Lebanon on Thursday killed 20 people, most of them Syrian migrants, according to Lebanese health officials.
Israel hit 75 sites early Thursday across southern and eastern Lebanon and launched a new wave of strikes in the evening, the military said. Throughout the day, Hezbollah fired some 175 projectiles into Israel, the Israeli military said. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, sparking some wildfires, though one rocket hit a street in a town near the northern city of Safed.
Israel has talked of a possible ground invasion into Lebanon to drive Hezbollah away from the border. It has moved thousands of troops to the north in preparation. Some 100,000 Lebanese have fled their homes in the past week, streaming into Beirut and points further north.
Israeli military vehicles transported tanks and armored vehicles toward the country’s northern border with Lebanon a day after commanders issued a call-up of reservists. Several tanks arrived in Kiryat Shmona, a hard-hit town just several miles from the border. 
Lebanon’s foreign minister called for an immediate cease-fire “on all fronts,” warning that continued violence at his nation’s border will “transform into a black hole that will engulf international and regional peace and security.”
Abdallah Bouhabib, speaking before the U.N. General Assembly, decried Israel’s “systematic destruction of Lebanese border villages.”
“The crisis in Lebanon threatens the entire Middle East,” Bouhabib said. “We wish today to reiterate our call for a cease-fire on all fronts.”
He said Lebanon welcomes efforts by the United States and France to move urgently toward a cease-fire before things spin out of control.
Hezbollah has not yet responded to the proposal. 
Israel’s military on Friday also said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen that set off air raid sirens across the country’s center. Sirens rang out across Israel’s populous central area, including the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv. Another missile from Yemen landed in central Israel about two weeks ago.
The escalation has raised fears of a repeat – or worse – of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah that wreaked destruction across southern Lebanon and other parts of the country and saw heavy Hezbollah rocket fire on Israeli cities.
“Another full-scale war could be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said after talks with his British and Australian counterparts in London.
One of Netanyahu’s far-right governing partners threatened to suspend cooperation with his government if it signs onto a temporary cease-fire with Hezbollah – and to quit completely if a permanent deal is reached. It was the latest sign of displeasure from Netanyahu’s allies toward international cease-fire efforts.
“If a temporary cease-fire becomes permanent, we will resign from the government,” said National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, head of the Jewish Power party.
If Ben-Gvir leaves the coalition, Netanyahu would lose his parliamentary majority. That could topple his government, though opposition leaders have said they would offer support for a cease-fire deal.
Hezbollah has insisted it would halt its strikes only if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, where Israel has battled Hamas for nearly a year. That appears out of reach.
One day after Hamas’ Oct 7 attack, Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel, bringing Israeli counterfire and a cycle of reprisals since. Hezbollah says its barrages are a show of support for Palestinians and that it is targeting Israeli military facilities, though rockets have also hit civilian areas. 
Before this week, the cross-border exchanges had killed about 600 people in Lebanon, mostly militants but including more than 100 civilians, and about four dozen people in Israel, roughly half of them soldiers and the rest civilians. The fighting also forced tens of thousands to flee homes on both sides of the border.
Israel says its escalated strikes across Lebanon the past week are targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Since Monday, strikes have killed more than 690 people in Lebanon, around a quarter of them women and children, according to local health authorities. 
The campaign opened with what is widely believed to be an Israeli attack on Sept. 18 and 19 detonating thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, killing at least 39 people and maiming thousands more, including civilians. 
Hezbollah in turn has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel. Several people in Israel have been wounded. On Wednesday, the group fired on Tel Aviv for the first time with a longer-range missile that was intercepted.
Early Thursday, an Israeli airstrike hit a building housing Syrian workers and their families near the ancient city of Baalbek in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 19 Syrians and a Lebanese were killed, one of the deadliest single strikes in Israel’s intensified air campaign.
Hussein Salloum, a local official in Younine, said most of the dead were women and children. The state news agency had initially reported that 23 people were dead.
Lebanon, with a population of around 6 million, hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered — the world’s highest refugee population per capita.

ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Algerians voted Saturday in an election to decide whether army-backed President Abdelmadjid Tebboune gets another term in office — five years after pro-democracy protests prompted the military to oust the previous president after two decades in power. 
There is little suspense about the result with Tebboune expected to win easily. The question is more about how many voters cast ballots.

Tebboune said after voting that he hoped “whoever wins will continue on the path towards a point of no return in the construction of democracy.”
Polls closed late Saturday and vote counting was underway as Algerians awaited an announcement of the results. The country’s election authority at 12:10 a.m. said that vote counting to so far suggested voter turnout was 48% in Algeria and 19.6% for precincts abroad — outpacing the country’s 2019 presidential election, where 39.9% of voters turned out to vote.
It’s unclear whether Tebboune will consider such a figure a triumph. In the lead-up to Saturday, his backers and rivals all urged Algerians to come out and vote after boycotts and high abstention rates in previous elections marred the government’s ability to claim popular support. 
Algeria is Africa’s largest country by area and, with almost 45 million people, it’s the continent’s second most populous after South Africa to hold presidential elections in 2024 — a year in which more than 50 elections are being held worldwide, encompassing more than half the world’s population. 
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024
The campaign — rescheduled earlier this year to take place during North Africa’s hot summer — was characterized by apathy from the population, which continues to be plagued by a high cost of living and drought that brought water shortages to some parts of the country.


“Uncle Tebboune,” as his campaign called the 78-year-old, was elected in December 2019 after nearly a year of weekly “Hirak” demonstrations demanding the resignation of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Their demands were met when Bouteflika resigned and was replaced by an interim government of his former allies, which called for elections later in the year.
Protesters opposed holding elections so soon, fearing the candidates running that year were close to the old regime and would derail dreams of a civilian-led, non-military state. Tebboune, a former prime minister seen as close to the military, won. But his victory was stained by boycotts and election day tumult.
Throughout his tenure, Tebboune has used oil and gas revenue to boost some social benefits — including unemployment insurance as well as public wages and pensions — to calm discontent. To cement his legitimacy, Tebboune hopes more of the country’s 24 million eligible voters participate in Saturday’s election than in his first election when only 39.9% voted.
Many Algerians remain unconvinced that elections will usher in change.

Activists and international organizations, including Amnesty International, have railed against how authorities continue prosecuting those involved in opposition parties, media organizations and civil society groups.
Some have denounced this election as a rubber stamp exercise that can only entrench the status quo.
“Algerians don’t give a damn about this bogus election,” said former Hirak leader Hakim Addad, who was banned from participating in politics three years ago. “The political crisis will persist as long as the regime remains in place. The Hirak has spoken.”
Twenty-six candidates submitted preliminary paperwork to run in the election, although only two were ultimately approved to challenge Tebboune.

Both avoided directly criticizing Tebboune on the campaign trail and, like the incumbent, emphasized election participation.
Abdelali Hassani Cherif, a 57-year-old head of the Islamist party Movement of Society for Peace, made populist appeals to Algerian youth, running on the slogan “Opportunity!” Youcef Aouchiche, a 41-year-old former journalist running with the Socialist Forces Front, or FFS, campaigned on a “vision for tomorrow.”
Both challengers and their parties risked losing backing from supporters who thought they were selling out by giving the impression the election was democratic and contested.
Walking near a vote center in downtown Algiers, longtime FFS supporter Mhand Kasdi said his party had betrayed its ideals by putting forth a candidate for the first time since 1999.
“It is giving its backing to a rigged election,” the 55-year-old gas station manager said, adding that Aouchiche and Hassani “are going to help make the regime’s candidate look good.”
Voting in his hometown Saturday, Aouchiche called on Algerians to vote for him “to give young people the confidence to put an end to the despair that drives them to take the boats of death in an attempt to reach the other side of the Mediterranean,” referring to those who migrate to Europe.
Andrew Farrand, the Middle East and North Africa director at the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage, said both challengers were looking more at the 2025 legislative elections than this 2024 presidential contest. Because Algerian law funds political parties based on the number of seats they win in legislative elections, they hope campaigning now positions them for a strong 2025 performance.
“It’s a long game: How can I mobilize my base? How can I build up a campaign machine? And how can I get into the good graces of the authorities so that I can be in a position to increase my seats?” he said. “We’ve seen that in their choice not to overtly criticize president … paired with a very strong message to Algerians to come out and vote.”",False

SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Kanon Woodill hit a 35-yard field goal with 31 seconds to play, Cade Haberman blocked a 62-yard try as time expired and Northern Illinois stunned No. 5 Notre Dame 16-14 on Saturday.
Haberman blocked the 62-yard attempt by Notre Dame’s Mitch Jeter, allowing the jubilant Huskies to claim their first nonconference victory against a ranked opponent since a 19-16 upset of No. 21 Alabama in 2003. It was also the Huskies’ first victory over a top 10 opponent.
Northern Illinois head coach Thomas Hammock was emotional after the dramatic victory.
“We didn’t need luck,” Hammock said. “That was our theme. I didn’t think we needed luck. We just need to play our best. It wasn’t the cleanest for us, but we played hard for four quarters and stayed together. They worked together, they believed, and they made enough plays to win a game.
“This is a program-changing type win, no different than when we beat Alabama a while ago.”
Hammond said his Huskies measured up to Notre Dame.
“I think we were bigger than what they thought,” Hammock said. “We’re not a normal MAC team, in my opinion. We’re big on the offensive and defensive lines and we’re physical. I didn’t look at it as a mismatch in that capacity.”
Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman said the loss was disappointing, especially on the heels of an impressive road win over then-No. 20 Texas A&M.
“You know, it’s our job as coaches to make sure these guys are ready to go. You go from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows in a tale of two weeks, but we’ve got to own this thing,” Freeman said. “As coaches and players, we’ve got to own it, and we’ve got to fix it.”


Notre Dame (1-1) looked like it was in position to get some separation from Northern Illinois (2-0) as it clung to a 14-13 lead in the fourth quarter. The Fighting Irish gained possession after a punt with 7:49 left and drove from their 25 to the Northern Illinois 49.
Fighting Irish quarterback Riley Leonard launched a pass deep up the middle intended for Kris Mitchell, but Amariyun Knighten made the interception and returned it 33 yards to the 50-yard line with 5:55 to play. 
“It was a completely bad read,” Leonard said of the interception. “That single high safety was attached to the inside post. I thought he wouldn’t attach again. Bad eyes, bad feet, bad ball. That resulted in a pick. Can’t happen. Completely my fault.”
The Huskies worked the clock and drove to the Notre Dame 19, setting the stage for Woodill’s field goal. A key play on the drive was converting a fourth-and-two with a three-yard run by quarterback Ethan Hampton to the Notre Dame 28.
The first-down conversion from Hampton, who was 10 of 19 for 198 yards and a touchdown, set up the winning field goal from Woodill, his third made kick of the day.
“It’s amazing,” Hampton said of the victory. “It’s something I’ll remember forever. I grew up a Huskie fan. Playing here has been a dream for me.”
Notre Dame struck first as Leonard side-stepped the defense for an 11-yard touchdown run with 8:28 left in the first quarter.
It only took five plays for Northern Illinois to answer as Antario Brown broke loose between two defensive backs for an 83-yard touchdown reception on a pass from Hampton.
A pair of field goals by Woodill from 42 and 21 yards gave the Huskies a 13-7 halftime lead. Notre Dame had the chance to make it 13-10 before half, but Haberman blocked a 48-yard try from Jeter.
Woodill missed a 53-yard field goal attempt on the first possession of the second half, and Notre Dame took advantage.
Jeremiyah Love broke loose for a 34-yard touchdown run, hurdling a defender on the way to the end zone. Mitch Jeter’s extra point gave Notre Dame a 14-13 lead with 8:34 left in the third quarter. 
Leonard finished 20 of 32 for 163 yards and two interceptions.
Notre Dame has plenty of work to do on the offensive side as a young Fighting Irish offensive line struggled to establish command of the line.
A veteran Northern Illinois squad has now firmly established itself as a contender in the Mid-American Conference.
Notre Dame will take a plunge in the rankings but likely stay in the Top 25.
Northern Illinois could receive a significant number of votes.
Notre Dame: Travels to West Lafayette to take on in-state rival Purdue on Saturday.
Northern Illinois: Gets a week off and then hosts Buffalo on Sept. 21.

PHOENIX (AP) — Matt Chapman hit an inside-the-park homer, Casey Schmitt and Michael Conforto both added solo shots and the San Francisco Giants continued to be a problem for teams with postseason aspirations, beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-3 on Monday night.
The Diamondbacks (87-70) lost more ground in the National League playoff race as they try to claim one of three wild cards. They’re in sole possession of the final wild card, 1 1/2 games ahead of the Atlanta Braves (85-71). The San Diego Padres (90-66) and New York Mets (87-69) are in the first two spots.
The Mets and Braves play each other in a crucial three-game series that begins on Tuesday in Atlanta.
“I don’t think there’s any pressing,” D-backs center fielder Jake McCarthy said. “We’ve had our foot pedal on the gas pedal the whole season, so just chalk it up to baseball. We’re going to bounce back tomorrow.”
San Francisco is out of the playoff race, but has played extremely well over the past week against teams that are still in contention. The Giants have a 6-1 record against the Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals and Diamondbacks.
It was another frustrating loss for Arizona, which coughed up an 8-0 lead on Sunday and fell to the Milwaukee Brewers 10-9. 
“Today, we got beat,” D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said. “Their pitcher was making quality pitches, we weren’t able to generate the offense we normally have and we got beat.”


Chapman’s inside-the-park homer in the third to put the Giants up 3-1. The third baseman laced a liner to one of the deepest parts of the park in left center, and a leaping McCarthy couldn’t quite make the grab at the wall. Left fielder Pavin Smith had to retrieve the carom in center field.
Chapman was hustling the whole way and easily beat the relay throw home from Geraldo Perdomo. Denard Span was the last San Francisco player to hit an inside-the-park homer in 2017.
“He seems to be up for anything these days,” Giants manager Bob Melvin said of Chapman. “It’s just showing everybody how we expect to play down the road.”
Schmitt added a solo homer in the fourth to make it 4-2. Conforto launched another long ball in the fifth for a 5-2 lead. Chapman added a run-scoring triple in the seventh, hammering another ball off the outfield wall to finish with three RBIs.
D-backs lefty Eduardo Rodriguez (3-4) gave up five runs on seven hits over 4 2/3 innings. He struck out eight and walked three.
“When you’re missing over the plate, you pay for it, no matter who you’re playing,” Rodriguez said.
Christian Walker cut the Giants’ lead to 3-2 in the fourth with an RBI double. Joc Pederson also had an RBI double.
San Francisco right-hander Hayden Birdsong (5-5) gave up two runs over five innings. Ryan Walker pitched a scoreless ninth for his 10th save.
Diamondbacks: C Gabriel Moreno (oblique) appeared to avoid serious injury despite leaving Sunday’s game with discomfort. He could return to the lineup as soon as Tuesday. ... 2B Ketel Marte (ankle) was out of the starting lineup for a day of rest, Lovullo said. He entered as a pinch hitter in the eighth inning.
The D-backs send RHP Brandon Pfaadt (10-9, 4.66) to the mound against Giants RHP Logan Webb (12-10, 3.58).

MENLO PARK, California (AP) — Meta unveiled updates to the company’s virtual reality headset and Ray Ban smart glasses on Wednesday as it tries to demonstrate its artificial intelligence prowess and the next generation of computing platforms beyond smartphones and computers.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg also showed off Orion, a prototype he called “the most advanced glasses the world has ever seen.”
“The technical challenges to make them are insane,” Zuckerberg told a crowd of developers and journalists at Meta’s Menlo Park, California, headquarters. The holographic augmented reality glasses, for one, needed to be glasses — not a bulky headset. There are no wires and they have to weigh less than 100 grams (3.5 ounces), among other things. And the beyond interacting with your voice, typing or hand gestures, Orion has a “wrist-based neural interface” — it lets you send a signal from your brain to the device, using a wristband that translates nerve signals into digital commands.
There is no release date for Orion — Zuckerberg called it a “glimpse of the future.” 
Seemingly in his element speaking to a cheering crowd, Zuckerberg said Meta is working to “bring the future to everyone” with its headsets, glasses and AI system. As part of an update to its Llama model, people will now be able to interact with Meta AI by speaking, with voices from celebrities such as John Cena, Judi Dench and Awkwafina. 
“We are trying to build a future that is more open, more accessible, more natural, and more about human connection,” Zuckerberg said. ”This is the continuation of the values and ideas that we have brought to the apps and technology that we have built over Meta’s first 20 years.”


An AI update aimed at influencers allows them to craft AI versions of themselves — for interacting with fans. On the keynote stage, an AI version of creator Don Allen Stevenson III appeared on the screen and answered a few questions just as the actual creator would. When Zuckerberg asked the AI creator about cattle ranching, it responded “my expertise lies in technology and design, not agriculture.” An earlier version of this tool was text only. 
Other AI updates include live translation, which Zuckerberg demonstrated on stage. While wearing the smart glasses, Zuckerberg spoke in English to Mexican mixed martial artist Brandon Moreno replying in Spanish — the conversation was translated in real time. People can also dub their videos in another language so that it looks like they are speaking natively — even going so far as changing their lips movements to match. 
Meta AI now has 500 million users, the company said. Jeremy Goldman of the research firm Emarketer called the number “jaw-dropping.” 
“Meta has transformed from just a social media company into an AI powerhouse. Zuckerberg’s move to celebrity voices is not just for fun — it’s a direct challenge to OpenAI, with an emphasis on real-world utility,” Goldman said. 
Meta, which introduced the Quest 3 last year, also showed off a cheaper version of the VR goggles — the 3S — that will cost $299. The regular Quest 3 costs $499. The S3 will start shipping on Oct. 15. 
“Meta is aggressively undercutting Apple’s Vision Pro to dominate the middle-tier AR/VR market,” Goldman said. Those VR goggles, which came out earlier this year after much anticipation, cost $3,500. 
While VR goggles have grabbed more headlines, the augmented reality Ray Bans turned out to be a sleeper hit for Meta. The company hasn’t disclosed sales numbers, but Zuckerberg said during Meta’s July earnings call that the glasses “continue to be a bigger hit sooner than we expected — thanks in part to AI.” Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that Meta seems to have gotten past the supply issues that plagued the Ray Bans a few months ago due to high demand. 
“They are kind of the perfect form factor for AI,” Zuckerberg said. The glasses, he added, let an AI assistant “see what you see, hear what you hear” and help you go about your day. 
For instance, you can ask the glasses to remind you where you parked or to pick up groceries, look at a pile of fruit and come up with a smoothie recipe, or help you pick out a party outfit. 
Meta — which renamed itself from Facebook in 2021, still makes nearly all of its money from advertising. In its most recent quarter, 98% of its more than $39 billion in revenue came from ads. At the same time, the company is investing heavily in AI and what Zuckerberg sees as the next generation of computing platforms such as VR headsets and AR glasses. 
“VR headsets, despite Meta’s assertion, will not go mainstream,” said Forrester research director Mike Proulx. “They’re too cumbersome, and people can only tolerate them in short bursts.”
Glasses, on the other hand “put computing power directly into a common and familiar form factor. As the smart tech behind these glasses matures, they have the potential to disrupt everyday consumers’ interactions with brands.”
Proulx said the Orion prototype “sets the stage for a future where a revolutionary 3D computing platform is within reach and can actually be useful to the everyday consumer.”",False

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Malik Willis acknowledges he wasn’t ready the last time he had to start an NFL game. The Green Bay Packers quarterback knew he’d be more prepared the next time an opportunity arose.
With plenty of help from his new teammates, Willis went out and proved it Sunday by helping the Packers beat the Indianapolis Colts 16-10 on Sunday. 
Acquired by Green Bay on Aug. 27 in trade from Tennessee, Willis threw his first career touchdown pass to help the Packers withstand the absence of the injured Jordan Love.
“I don’t think you guys can appreciate or even comprehend the task that Malik Willis (faced),” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. “This guy got here three weeks ago.”
Love didn’t play after injuring his left medial collateral ligament during the final series of a 34-29 season-opening loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sept. 6 in Brazil. It was the first game Love missed since taking over as Green Bay’s starting quarterback last year.
The Packers (1-1) relied on an all-around effort to win without Love. Josh Jacobs ran for 151 yards on 32 carries to lead Green Bay’s 261-yard rushing attack. The defense hounded Anthony Richardson into three interceptions.
But the Packers might not have won without Willis’ steadiness.
Willis had made three previous career starts – all in 2022 – and hadn’t thrown for as many as 100 yards in any of them. Tennessee dealt Willis for a seventh-round pick after he couldn’t beat out Mason Rudolph for the right to back up Titans starter Will Levis.


“I’m just grateful for God giving me another opportunity somewhere different, a clean slate, just giving me the opportunity to be around guys who’ve helped me get going in this past three weeks as far as just learning as much as I can,” Willis said.

Willis played efficiently and went 12 of 14 for 122 yards, including a 14-yard touchdown pass to Dontayvion Wicks. Brayden Narveson went 3 of 4 on field-goal attempts to account for Green Bay’s other points.
Indianapolis’ Jonathan Taylor rushed for 103 yards on 12 carries, but didn’t touch the ball in the fourth quarter. Richardson was 17 of 34 for 204 yards with one touchdown to go along with his three interceptions. Richardson also ran for 37 yards on four carries.
“We started out slow as a group, especially as an offense,” Richardson said. “We definitely can’t do that. We know we’re better than that.”
The Packers didn’t need Willis to throw the ball much early because they were running wild against the Colts’ porous defense, enabling them to take a 10-0 advantage in the first quarter. That lead would reach 13-0 early in the third.
Green Bay ended up running the ball on 53 of its 67 snaps. It was the Packers’ most running plays since they had 54 in a 10-10 tie with Minnesota in 1978.
The Packers gained 164 yards rushing in the first quarter alone, the highest first-quarter total for any NFL team since the Denver Broncos had 167 in the opening period of a 41-23 loss to the New England Patriots on Dec. 18, 2011. By halftime, the Packers had 237 yards rushing on 34 carries.
“We knew we had to come in and run the ball today,” Jacobs said. “We knew we had to set that tone.”
The Packers continued to run the ball on a hot day that challenged their own offensive linemen. The temperature at kickoff was 85 degrees, tied for the second-warmest home game in franchise history (since 1959) behind only an 89-degree game vs. Cincinnati on Sept. 24, 2017.
That heat bothered Packers center Josh Myers enough that it led to one unusual moment.
“I asked Malik why he didn’t throw the ball on that third down,” LaFleur said, “and he told me that Josh threw up on the ball.” 
Indianapolis (0-2) was coming off a 29-27 loss to the Houston Texans in which they had allowed 213 yards rushing, the highest total any team had given up in the season’s opening week.
“We’ve got to get it fixed,” Colts coach Shane Steichen said. “It starts with myself, I’m the head coach, and we’ve got to get in that meeting room on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and get it fixed. And, that’s the bottom line.”
Green Bay blew a chance to break the game open early in the second quarter when Jacobs fumbled on first-and-goal from the 4. Zaire Franklin forced the fumble that Laiatu Latu recovered in the end zone.
The Colts’ run defense stiffened in the second half, but they couldn’t come all the way back because their offense failed to capitalize on opportunities. The Colts failed to score on three separate trips into Packers territory.
Indianapolis cut the Packers’ lead to 16-10 on Richardson’s 4-yard touchdown pass to Alec Pierce with 1:47 left, but Green Bay’s Evan Williams recovered the ensuing onside kick. 
The Colts got the ball back at their own 5-yard line with 43 seconds left, but Williams intercepted a Hail Mary attempt from the Indianapolis 41 to end the game.
Colts: DT DeForest Buckner was helped off the field in the third quarter. ... Latu left with a hip injury in the second half. ... The Colts were playing without S Julian Blackmon (shoulder) and WR Josh Downs (ankle).
Packers: G Jordan Morgan didn’t play the second half due to a shoulder injury. ... RB MarShawn Lloyd hurt his ankle.
Colts: Host the Chicago Bears next Sunday.
Packers: Visit the Tennessee Titans next Sunday.

Publication date:2024-09-26 17:56:46

Nearly 700 people have been killed in Lebanon this week, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, as Israel dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting Hezbollah’s military capacities.
Over the past week, Israel has carried out several strikes in Beirut targeting senior Hezbollah commanders. Earlier in the day, a strike in eastern Lebanon killed 20 people, most of them Syrian migrants, according to Lebanese health officials. Also Thursday, the health ministry said two people were killed and 15 were wounded after an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building in a southern suburb of Beirut. The Israel Defense Force said the strike killed a Hezbollah drone commander, Mohammed Hussein Surour.
Lebanon’s disaster risk management unit said Thursday in a report that 60 people were killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon and 81 injured over 24 hours, bringing the total killed since Monday in Lebanon to 696. More than 1,540 people have been killed in Lebanon in the ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel since last October, the report said.
After the Beirut explosion, dozens of rockets were fired toward the northern Israeli city of Safed, with one hitting a street in a nearby town. In total, 175 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Thursday, the military said. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, some sparking wildfires.
The strikes came after Israel’s military chief said Wednesday that the country was preparing for a possible ground operation in Lebanon as Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel is striking Hezbollah “with full force” and won’t stop until its goals are achieved.


Late Wednesday, the United States, France and other allies jointly called for an “immediate” 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations as fears grow that the violent escalation in recent days — following 11 months of cross-border exchange of fire — could grow into an all-out war. 
The International Organization for Migration estimated Thursday that more than 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. That figure includes the more than 100,000 who were displaced before this week’s escalation. 
Here’s the latest:
Lebanon’s foreign minister called Thursday for an immediate cease-fire “on all fronts,” warning that continued violence at his nation’s border will “transform into a black hole that will engulf international and regional peace and security.”
Abdallah Bouhabib, speaking before the U.N. General Assembly, decried Israel’s “systematic destruction of Lebanese border villages.”
“The crisis in Lebanon threatens the entire Middle East,” Bouhabib said. “We wish today to reiterate our call for a cease-fire on all fronts.”
He said Lebanon welcomes efforts by the United States and France to move urgently toward a cease-fire before things spin out of control.
TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s military said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen that set off air raid sirens across the country’s center. Air raid sirens rang out across Israel’s populous central area, including the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv.
Another missile from Yemen landed in central Israel about two weeks ago.
BEIRUT — Hezbollah confirmed the death of Mohammed Hussein Surour, one of its drone unit commanders, in a statement. 
The Israeli military had earlier said it killed Surour in a strike in Beirut. 
The strike hit an apartment building in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Until recently, Israel had rarely targeted sites in Beirut during the low-level conflict with Hezbollah that has been ongoing since October. However, in the past week, Israel has struck Beirut’s southern suburbs several times.
MONTREAL — French President Emmanuel Macron says it would be a mistake for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reject a 21-day halt in fighting between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah to give time for negotiations. Macron says rejecting the proposal by France, the United States and allies will only cause further violence and France is “opposed to Lebanon becoming a new Gaza.” 
Macron spoke as he visited Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who also said there needs to be an immediate cease-fire. 
Netanyahu said earlier Thursday that Israel is striking Hezbollah “with full force” and won’t stop until its goals are achieved. 
Both France and Canada have close ties to the people of Lebanon.
WASHINGTON — White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. had “every reason to believe” that the Israeli government was willing to consider a cease-fire across its border with Lebanon before President Joe Biden and other world leaders called for a 21-day pause in the fighting late Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters, Kirby declined to detail what changed between that point and Thursday morning when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to reject the cease-fire proposal and pledged further efforts to weaken Hezbollah’s military capacity.
“I think you ought to ask that question to Prime Minister Netanyahu,” he said.
Still, Kirby said senior U.S. negotiators were still working with the Israelis and other partners to try to bring about a temporary cease-fire.
“It’s not clear to us that from a practical perspective that there isn’t cause for us to continue to have these conversations with the Israelis,” Kirby said.
Kirby declined to say why the U.S. believed Wednesday that a “breakthrough” was near and whether Biden believes he was misled by Netanyahu.
Kirby said there were legitimate reasons for Israel to want to take out Hezbollah targets, mentioning a Wednesday ballistic missile launch aimed at Tel Aviv. “He and his cabinet and the Israeli people have every right to want to thwart that threat,” Kirby said.
“We still believe an all-out war is not the best way to get people back in their homes,” Kirby added. “If that’s the goal, an all-out war, we don’t believe is the right way to do that.”
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting Thursday with Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
UNITED NATIONS — Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told reporters at the United Nations on Thursday that Israel “is dragging the whole region into the abyss of a regional war, as we see happening in Lebanon.” 
He added: “This has to stop, it has to stop immediately ... (Israel) is continuing with its war on Lebanon. In this (UNGA) week, many, many leaders and foreign ministers were here, and the question on everybody’s mind is, ‘Then what? How are we going to get this to stop?’”
KIRYAT SHMONA, Israel — Israeli military vehicles were seen transporting tanks and armored vehicles toward the country’s northern border with Lebanon on Thursday, a day after commanders issued a call-up of reservists.
Several tanks arrived in Kiryat Shmona, a hard-hit town just several kilometers (miles) from the border. Earlier, Israeli air defenses intercepted a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon.
Israel’s military chief has said the army should prepare for a possible ground operation in Lebanon, and Israel has begun massing forces along the border in recent days.
WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Israel was “aware” of the joint statement by members of the Group of Seven industrial nations, the European Union and Middle Eastern countries that calls for a 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon. Jean-Pierre said there continue to be diplomatic conversations in New York City about how to stop the conflict.
Asked if the conflict amounted to a war, Jean-Pierre said, “I’m not going to get into semantics from here.”
BEIRUT — The International Organization for Migration estimated Thursday that more than 200,000 people have been displaced by the conflict in Lebanon, including more than 100,000 who were displaced before this week’s escalation. 
Lebanon’s General Security agency said more than 31,000 people crossed the border from Lebanon into Syria in two days.
BEIRUT— Sixty people were killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon and 81 injured over the past 24 hours, the country’s disaster risk management unit said in a statement Thursday, bringing the total killed since Monday in Lebanon to 696.
A total of 1,540 people have been killed in Lebanon in the ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel since last October, the report said.
Tens of thousands of Lebanese have fled areas targeted by heavy Israeli bombardment over the past four days. A total of 77,100 had been registered at shelters for the displaced in that period, the report said. The actual number displaced could be “many times higher,” it said, as many people who went to stay with relatives or to their own second homes or rented apartments or hotels were not officially registered.
Lebanon’s General Security agency recorded 31,730 people crossing the border from Lebanon into Syria over the past two days alone, the report said. Of those, 15,600 were Syrian and 16,130 Lebanese.
JERUSALEM — Israel’s rescue services say a 45 year-old man was moderately injured by shrapnel in the last of a series of rocket attacks on northern Israel on Thursday. 
According to the Israeli army, some 25 rockets were launched from Lebanon in the last barrage, setting of sirens in a cluster of towns and communities east of Haifa. 
A total of 175 projectiles were fired so far today from Lebanon on northern Israel, according to the army, most of which were intercepted or fell in open areas.
TEL AVIV — Some 45 rockets were fired from Lebanon on the northern city of Safed and surrounding communities, according to the Israeli army, shortly after Israel killed a Hezbollah commander in a strike on Beirut.
Israeli police said heavy damage was caused by falling fragments, but there were no reports of injuries. It was the second heavy barrage on the area Thursday.
A total of 150 projectiles were fired so far Thursday from Lebanon on northern Israel, according to the army, most of which were intercepted or fell in open areas.
LONDON — Britain’s defense secretary has echoed the call for a pause in Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah. 
“I urge President Netanyahu and the Lebanese Hezbollah leaders to pay heed to the combined voices at the United Nations to do just that,” John Healey said after a meeting with his U.S. and Australian counterparts in London.
Healey said his country has sent 700 troops to Cyprus to assist in a potential emergency evacuation of civilians in Lebanon should a full war break out. 
U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pressed both Israel and Lebanon to choose the path of cease-fire and urged each side to accept a temporary pause to avoid further escalation.
“Israel and Lebanon can choose a different path,” he said. “Despite a sharp escalation in recent days, a diplomatic solution is still viable ... All parties should seize this opportunity.”
And he issued a warning to Iran and other U.S. adversaries, saying: “No one should try to exploit this crisis or expand this conflict.”
NEW YORK — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is striking Hezbollah “with full force” and won’t stop until its goals are achieved.
Netanyahu spoke as he landed in New York to attend the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting and as U.S. and European officials were pressing for a 21-day halt in fighting between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah to give time for negotiations.
Netanyahu said Israel’s “policy is clear. We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force. And we will not stop until we reach all our goals, chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.”
He added that he approved the “targeted killing operation” of the head of Hezbollah’s drone unit in south Beirut Thursday.
Israel has dramatically escalated strikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is targeting Hezbollah. Israeli leaders have said they are determined to stop more than 11-months of cross-border fire by the militant group into Israel, which has forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israelis from communities in the north.
TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israel Defense Force says an airstrike on Beirut has killed a Hezbollah drone commander.
Israel’s military said Thursday that its fighter jets attacked Beirut on Thursday and killed Mohammed Hussein Surour, who it described as a “commander of Hezbollah’s aerial unit.”
It said Surour “promoted, directed and commanded many aerial terrorist attacks, including drone attacks, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles aimed at Israel.”
Hezbollah has not commented on the claim. 
BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry says two people were killed and 15 were wounded after an airstrike hit an apartment building in a southern suburb of Beirut.
The health ministry said those wounded included a woman who was in critical condition. 
Al-Manar TV, the TV station of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, reported earlier Thursday that an Israeli airstrike caused an explosion on an apartment building in south Beirut, but did not give further details. 
The Israeli military said it carried out a “targeted strike” south of Beirut. It said more details will be released later.
The strike came two days after a similar attack killed a senior Hezbollah military commander with the group’s missile unit.
NEW YORK — Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the world is united in calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah and will be seeking approval from Israeli officials after the release of a proposal for a temporary 21-day halt in fighting.
“It is now the G7 countries, the European Union, the leading Arab countries, everyone speaking with one clear voice about the need to get that cease-fire in the north,” Blinken said in an interview with MSNBC on Thursday before he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s top strategy advisor, Ron Dermer, in New York.
Netanyahu himself is en route to New York where he will speak on Friday at the UN General Assembly. His office said the cease-fire call is only a proposal and that Israel would continue to defend its land and people from attacks by Hezbollah from Lebanese territory.
“I can’t speak for him,” Blinken said of Netanyahu. “I can just say that the world is speaking clearly for virtually all of the key countries in Europe and in the region on the need for the ceasefire.”
“What we’re saying, what the world is saying, is very clear, and we’ll be looking to work with the Israelis and all the parties throughout the rest of the day,” he added. 
BEIRUT — Syrian pro-government media outlets say Israel’s air force has carried out airstrikes along the Lebanon-Syria border, wounding five people and destroying a bridge that links the countries.
Syria’s Sham FM radio station and Dama Post reported that the airstrike wounded five people and destroyed the bridge near the Matraba border crossing on the Lebanese side in the northeastern Hermel region. 
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported several Israeli airstrikes in Hermel.
The Israeli military said it attacked infrastructure used to transfer weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
TEL AVIV, Israel — Families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza for nearly a year are urging Israel to ensure than any possible cease-fire deal with Hezbollah includes provisions for the war in Gaza.
Gil Dickmann, whose cousin, Carmel Gat, was kidnapped and was one of six Israelis killed in Hamas tunnels in August, said the families of the hostages are feeling forgotten as attention shifts to the northern front.
“We know that these things are connected to each other, the northern part and the southern part, they’re all part of the same large situation in which we are at from October 7th on. And we’re very worried that if we don’t make the right decisions now, we will miss this amazing opportunity to get the hostages out,” Dickmann said on Thursday.
He slammed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for missing multiple opportunities to free his cousin over the past 11 months and begged him to agree to a cease-fire with both Hezbollah and Hamas that would include provisions for the hostages. 
Dickmann’s sister-in-law, Yarden Roman-Gat, was released in the week-long cease-fire deal last November, along with nearly 100 other hostages.
Hamas-led militants abducted some 250 people during their Oct. 7 attack in Israel in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza since then.
TEL AVIV, Israel — The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cease-fire called on by the United States, France and other allies is only a proposal, and that Netanyahu, who is on a flight en route to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly, has not responded to it.
The U.S. and its allies jointly called Wednesday for an immediate 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days.
Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who is the acting prime minister during Netanyahu’s trip abroad, said there will be no cease-fire in the north, vowing to continue the fighting in the north “with full force until victory” and returning the tens of thousands of Israeli citizens evacuated from their homes.
Netanyahu’s office added that the Israeli military was continuing to strike Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.
BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on a village in northeast Lebanon destroyed a building housing Syrian workers, killing 23 of them and wounding another eight people.
State-run National News Agency quoted the village’s mayor Ali Kassas as saying that the bodies of 23 Syrian citizens were pulled out from under the rubble, adding that four other Syrians and four Lebanese were wounded in the same airstrike late Wednesday in the village of Younine, just north of the ancient city of Baalbek in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley that borders Syria.
The Lebanese Red Cross said it evacuated the bodies of nine people following the airstrike. Others were taken by Hezbollah’s paramedic arm as well as the Lebanese Civil Defense, NNA said.
A country of about 6 million people, Lebanon hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered — the world’s highest refugee population per capita. 
TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military says it struck 75 sites overnight across southern and eastern Lebanon, part of a punishing air campaign in response to Hezbollah rocket fire.
The military said Thursday it was targeting Hezbollah military infrastructure, including weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers. Around half a dozen Israelis have been wounded in the latest escalation.
Israel strikes have killed more than 630 people in Lebanon since Monday, about a quarter of them women and children. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of projectiles towards Israel over the past week, including a surface-to-surface missile toward Tel Aviv that was intercepted Wednesday.
The Israeli military said around 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Thursday, all of them either intercepted or falling in open areas. There were no reports of casualties or damage.
Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza, hoping to pin down Israeli forces. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are close allies of Iran.
The fighting has driven tens of thousands of people from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel has vowed to do whatever is necessary to allow its citizens to return, and has moved thousands of troops to the northern border in preparation for what could be a ground campaign into southern Lebanon.
The United States, France and other allies jointly called for an “immediate” 21-day cease-fire in the conflict to “provide space for diplomacy” as fears grow that the violence could become an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, which would further destabilize a region already shaken by the war in Gaza.
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Britain says it’s sending $6.7 million worth of humanitarian assistance, including medical supplies, hygiene kits and fuel to Lebanon to support the civilian population there as fighting forces thousands to flee their homes.
The United Kingdom said in a statement that the United Nations agency for children, UNICEF, will distribute the supplies, which will also help aid workers better deal with urgent health and nutrition needs.
The U.K. earlier announced that 700 troops, including Border Force and Foreign Office officials, would be deployed to a British military base in Cyprus to prepare for possible evacuations of British citizens from the region as fighting could potentially escalate.
An online portal and phone line have been reopened for British nationals in Lebanon to register their presence.
Cyprus is situated approximately 210 kilometers (130 miles) west of the Lebanese capital. The east Mediterranean island nation served as a waystation for the repatriation of approximately 60,000 foreign nationals who where evacuated from Lebanon during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.
Britain’s Minister of State for Development, Women and Equalities, Anneliese Dodds, said the U.K. will continue to support Lebanese people as it urges British nationals to leave the country.
British navy ships RFA Mounts Bay and the HMS Duncan were already in the eastern Mediterranean on Thursday, while the Royal Air Force has aircraft and transport helicopters on standby to provide support if needed.
The United States, France and other allies called Wednesday for an “immediate” 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days.
The joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, says the recent fighting is “intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.”
“We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy,” the statement reads. “We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.”
The signatories include the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — Mohammad Yousuf resigned as Pakistan cricket selector on Sunday due to personal reasons.
Yousuf’s resignation came only five days after Pakistan named its squad for the first test against England, starting at Multan on Oct. 7. Yousuf was one of the four members of the selection committee that also includes former test cricketer Asad Shafiq, test head coach Jason Gillespie and test captain Shan Masood.
“I announce my resignation as a selector for the Pakistan cricket team due to personal reasons,” Yousuf wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Serving this incredible team has been a profound privilege, and I am proud to have contributed to the growth and success of Pakistan Cricket.”
Yousuf was named to the selection panel earlier this year, but Pakistan had little success, making an early exit from the T20 World Cup where it lost group matches against arch-rival India and co-host United States. Bangladesh also registered a historic 2-0 win when it swept Pakistan in the two-test series.
Later, the Pakistan Cricket Board said that Yousuf had voluntarily stepped down from his role as a member of the national selection committee to focus on other key responsibilities within the PCB.
“The PCB expresses its sincere gratitude to Mohammad Yousuf for his invaluable contributions during his tenure as a selection committee member,” the PCB said in a statement. 
“Yousuf will continue to play a pivotal role at the PCB, sharing his extensive knowledge and experience as the batting coach at the high performance centre.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris raised $27 million at a packed New York City fundraiser on Sunday, her largest fundraising haul since she took over at the top of the ticket from President Joe Biden, according to a Harris campaign aide. 
Though Harris has far more money than former President Donald Trump, the money will be needed to compete with pricey advertising by deep-pocketed outside groups that support Trump, said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private fundraising details.
The blockbuster fundraiser was held at Cipriani Wall Street in a massive Greek Revival ballroom with over a dozen columns. Much of the crowd stood shoulder to shoulder as Harris needled Trump for refusing to debate her again.
“My opponent seems to be looking for an excuse,” Harris told the crowd. “I feel very strongly that we owe it to the American people, to the voters, to meet once more before Election Day.”
She reiterated that later, telling reporters after landing outside Washington, “We have more to discuss.”
Trump has rejected more debates, saying Saturday that “it’s just too late.” 
“Voting is already started,” he said at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina. Voters cast the first in-person ballots last week in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia, the states with the first early in-person voting opportunities. About a dozen more states will follow by mid-October.


Harris also said she would deliver a speech Wednesday outlining her economic vision, saying there is “more we can do to invest in the aspirations and ambitions of the American people while addressing the challenges they face.”
She cited the high cost of home ownership and stubbornly high grocery bills as examples.

“I grew up a middle-class kid and I will never forget where I came from,” she said.
By fleshing out her economic agenda in more detail, Harris can address an issue that’s front of mind for voters after prices soared during Biden’s presidency and distance herself from the president’s economic track record. Trump has criticized her for being slow to release detailed policy proposals of her own since she rose to the top of the ticket. 
Harris has said she’d push for middle-class tax cuts and tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations, and she adopted Trump’s proposal to end taxes on tipped wages, though she’d limit her plan to low- and middle-income taxpayers. She’s also criticized Trump’s plan to impose large tariffs on most imported goods, which she says would severely raise the cost of goods. 
Neither Harris nor Trump has a decisive edge with the public on the economy, according to the latest poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey suggests Harris is gaining ground on an issue that was once a clear strength for Trump. 
About 4 in 10 registered voters say Republican Trump would do a better job handling the economy, while a similar number say that about the Democratic vice president, according to the poll. About 1 in 10 voters don’t trust either candidate, and a similar share has equal faith in them.
The new poll found that the economy is one of the most important issues for about 8 in 10 voters as they consider which candidate to support, dwarfing other top issues like health care and crime.
Harris has backed away from the liberal positions she took during her ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign, including proposals to ban fracking, establish a single-payer health care system and decriminalize illegal border crossings.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Kalel Mullings rushed for 111 yards and two touchdowns in his first start at running back as No. 12 Michigan held on to the Little Brown Jug with a 27-24 win in the rain against Minnesota on Saturday.
“Coach told me I was starting today, but it didn’t change much for me,” said Mullings, who leads the Wolverines with 540 yards and six touchdowns in five games. “I always prepare like I’m going to (be) on the field for every play.”
Michigan led 24-3 going into the fourth quarter, but Minnesota scored three touchdowns to pull within 27-24 with 1:37 left.
The Gophers recovered the onside kick but were flagged for offsides. Mullings grabbed the second kick, allowing the Wolverines to run out the clock.
“We practiced that,” he said. “They lined up the same way, so I figured he was going to try the same kick, so I went after it before it went 10 yards.”
The Wolverines (4-1, 2-0 Big Ten) extended their school-record conference winning streak to 27 games. They haven’t lost a Big Ten game since Michigan State beat them in 2021.
Minnesota (2-3, 0-2) hoped to win the Little Brown Jug for the first time in a decade and only the third time in the 21st century.
“We are way past the point where moral victories matter to this program,” Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck said. “Everyone on our sideline thought we were going to win that game.” 
Mullings made up for another weak performance from the passing game. Alex Orji completed 10 of 18 passes for 86 yards. He did throw one touchdown pass, but his interception helped Minnesota’s fourth-quarter comeback.


“I had Donovan (Edwards) open on the other side of the field,” he said. “I have to stay true to my training and get him the ball.”
Mullings finished Michigan’s first drive with an untouched 27-yard touchdown run, but both offenses bogged down in the wet conditions. 
The Wolverines’ defense, though, forced a fumble early in the second quarter, giving them the ball at the Gophers 16. Mullings carried on the next three plays, bulling his way into the end zone from the 1 for a 14-0 lead.
Kechaun Bennett blocked a Minnesota punt later in the quarter. Orji hit Tyler Morris on the next play for an 11-yard touchdown to make it 21-0.
Minnesota got on the board on the last play of the half. Brosmer hit Nick Kallerup for 44 yards to the Michigan 1 and the field goal unit got onto the field in time for Dragan Kesich to kick a 20-yarder.
Dominic Zvada’s 53-yard field goal restored Michigan’s 21-point lead midway through the third quarter, but Orji’s interception on the next drive led to a 3-yard touchdown run by Darius Taylor.
After the Wolverines went three-and-out, freshman Koi Perich returned a punt 60 yards to the Michigan 17, and Taylor got his second touchdown to make it 24-17 with 11:05 to play.
“When you give a Big Ten team field position, that’s what is going to happen,” Michigan coach Sherrone Moore said. “Every Big Ten team is a tough opponent. We don’t look at them any differently.”
Michigan ran 6:32 off the clock to set up Zvada’s second field goal and the 27-17 lead with 4:33 to go, but Brosmer hit Daniel Jackson for a 12-yard score to make it a three-point game.
“Our quarterback played his butt off, Darius Taylor played his butt off, our defense played their butts off,” Fleck said. “There were some plays that hurt us on special teams.”
Zvada’s 53-yard field goal was his fourth 50-plus kick this season, setting a school record.
“When we got him in here and he started banging through 60-yarders, it didn’t take long to realize we had something here,” Moore said. 
It isn’t unusual for a governor to attend a Big Ten game, but things get slightly different when he’s running for vice president. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had a heavy Secret Service contingent when he visited the field during warmups, and the postgame news conferences were delayed for 30 minutes to expedite his departure.
Minnesota: hosts No. 13 USC next Saturday.
Michigan: visits Washington next Saturday for its first road game.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Michael Siani hit a tiebreaking two-run single in the 12th inning, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-4 on Tuesday night.
Siani came to the plate after a wild pitch by Elvis Peguero (7-4) put runners on second and third. He lined an opposite-field single into left field to give the Cardinals a 6-4 lead.
Siani then stole second and advanced to third on catcher William Contreras’ throwing error, setting up a sacrifice fly by Alec Burleson.
Ryan Helsley (7-4) pitched two innings for the win, striking out four. The All-Star closer was going for his 43rd save before Willy Adames hit a two-out RBI double in the 11th for Milwaukee.
Siani nearly made an outstanding diving catch on Adames’ liner to center, but the ball squirted out of his glove as his right arm got twisted in the outfield grass. The Cardinals challenged the call and the ruling was upheld.
The replay official “definitively determined” that Siani “failed to maintain firm and secure possession of the ball throughout the catch,” Major League Baseball said in a statement.
Siani was playing in his second game since missing nearly a month with a right oblique strain.
“I tried my best to flush the play in the outfield and make something happen with the bat,” he said.
Paul Goldschmidt homered for St. Louis, which won for the third time in four games to move back over .500 at 70-69. Goldschmidt, who finished with three hits and three RBIs, has a 10-game hitting streak.


“I just love the way they are going about it right now,” St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said. “You’re going to lose some, you’re going to win some, but just the mentality and overall effort and focus. Tough win, I liked it.” 
Jackson Chourio and Joey Ortiz connected for the NL Central-leading Brewers (81-58), who had won six of seven. Aaron Civale struck out seven while pitching five innings of three-run ball.
Adames went 1 for 5 with three strikeouts, ending his streak of five straight games with a home run. The shortstop, who reached 100 RBIs with his clutch swing in the 11th, has a career-long 12-game hitting streak. 
“You credit the St. Louis pitching, if you want, because I think they did a really nice job,” Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said. “It wasn’t our normal output in my mind.” 
Nolan Arenado hit a sacrifice fly and Goldschmidt doubled home Brendan Donovan, giving St. Louis a 2-0 lead in the first.
But Ortiz hit a leadoff drive in the third for his 10th homer. After Brice Turang grounded out, Chourio tied it at 2 with his 19th on the season. 
Steven Matz pitched 4 2/3 innings for the Cardinals in his first big league game since April 30. He was charged with three runs and three hits. The left-hander had been sidelined by a lower back strain.
Marmol and third base coach Daniel Descalso were ejected in the fourth by home plate umpire Lance Barrett for arguing balls and strikes. Pedro Pagés was batting for the Cardinals when they were thrown out.
All-Star William Contreras went 0 for 4. He is hitless with five walks in his last 14 at-bats.
Brewers: LHP Hoby Milner was reinstated from the injured list. RHP Bryse Wilson (right oblique strain) was placed on the 15-day IL. LHP Bryan Hudson was optioned to Triple-A Nashville, and Peguero was recalled from the minors.
The three-game series concludes with Cardinals RHP Sonny Gray (12-9, 3.96 ERA) facing Brewers RHP Colin Rea (12-4, 3.70 ERA) on Wednesday night.

NEW YORK (AP) — Linkin Park is back with a new lineup and debuting their first new music since the 2017 death of lead singer Chester Bennington.

On Thursday, the band kicked off a livestream showcasing new singer Emily Armstrong and drummer Colin Brittain, who will join returning members Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson, Phoenix and Joe Hahn in Linkin Park’s new lineup. Shinoda and Armstrong share vocal duties.
The new lineup launched into a new single, “The Emptiness Machine,” at the top of the stream. Armstrong’s performance style comfortably continues the band’s legacy: Her full-throated vocals recall Bennington without attempting parody, immediately evidenced on the second song of the set: “Somewhere I Belong.”
“This is a very special day for us,” Shinoda said as he led introductions, mentioning that guitarist Alex Feder was filling in Delson for the night. “In the role of Chester Bennington this afternoon is each of you,” Shinoda addressed the crowd.
The new Linkin Park also announced a new album, “From Zero.” It releases Nov. 15.
The rock-rap band is one of the most commercially successful acts of the 2000s, aided by Bennington’s vocals. At 41, he died by suicide shortly after the release of the group’s last album, “One More Light.” In the years since, Linkin Park has dropped a number of re-releases, including 20th anniversary editions of “Hybrid Theory,” “Meteora” and, this year, the career-spanning greatest hits collection, “Papercuts.”

“Before Linkin Park, our first band name was Xero. This album title refers to both this humble beginning and the journey we’re currently undertaking,” Shinoda said in a statement announcing the upcoming release.


Armstrong comes from alt-rock band Dead Sara and Brittain is a songwriter and producer who has worked with Papa Roach, One OK Rock and All Time Low, among others. He replaces original drummer Rob Bourdon, who “has decided to step away,” a band representative told The Associated Press.
“The more we worked with Emily and Colin, the more we enjoyed their world-class talents, their company, and the things we created,” Shinoda said. “We feel really empowered with this new lineup and the vibrant and energized new music we’ve made together. We’re weaving together the sonic touchpoints we’ve been known for and still exploring new ones.”

PROVO, Utah (AP) — BYU’s defense forced three turnovers, Jake Retzlaff threw for 149 yards and two touchdowns and Parker Kingston had a highlight reel 90-yard punt return touchdown in a 38-9 victory over No. 13 Kansas State on Saturday night.
Sione Moa added a career-high 76 yards and a touchdown on the ground. The Cougars (4-0, 1-0 Big 12) snapped a five-game losing streak to Big 12 opponents in emphatic fashion.
“A lot of people were surprised by this. They didn’t really think we could do this,” Moa said. “This is not a surprise to us. We know the work we put in to get to this point.”
Avery Johnson piled up 204 yards of total offense for the Wildcats but also threw a pair of interceptions. DJ Giddens rushed for 93 yards on 19 carries as Kansas State (3-1, 0-1) dropped to 0-4 all-time in Provo despite totaling 224 rushing yards. The Wildcats did not score a touchdown in a game for the first time since 2020.
“We just shot ourselves in the foot too many times and we got to score touchdowns,” Johnson said. “You got to take care of the football on the road if you want to win games.”
BYU scored a pair of touchdowns 39 seconds apart before halftime after forcing turnovers on back-to-back Kansas State drives.
Jack Kelly stripped the ball from Giddens on a third-down run and Tommy Prassas took the fumble 30 yards to the house, giving the Cougars their first lead, 10-6. Tyler Batty intercepted Johnson two plays later at the Wildcats 29. His takeaway set up a 23-yard touchdown catch by Chase Roberts that gave BYU a 17-6 lead going into halftime.


“You got to make them earn it all and eventually we were able to crack the code a little bit and get some turnovers and create some momentum and then you saw the result,” BYU coach Kalani Sitake said.
Johnson tossed his second interception to Harrison Taggart on Kansas State’s opening drive of the second half. Taggart’s pick and a subsequent 24-yard sprint by Moa set up a 3-yard TD catch by Darius Lassiter and extended BYU’s lead to 24-6.
After the defense forced a three-and-out, Kingston nearly fumbled the ensuing punt but managed to scoop up the ball, cut over to the opposite sideline and race 90 yards for a touchdown. His score put BYU up 31-6 less than five minutes into the third quarter.
“It was stunning to see that,” Kansas State coach Chris Klieman said. “We got embarrassed and that hasn’t happened here since the Covid year.”
A 22-yard touchdown run by Moa early in the fourth capped the night for the Cougars.
Kansas State: The Wildcats gashed BYU with long runs on their first two drives, totaling 117 rushing yards and averaging 6.9 yards per carry, but only came away with a pair of field goals before the wheels fell off on offense.
BYU: Forcing turnovers on three straight Kansas State drives helped the Cougars turn a close game into a blowout early in the second half. BYU scored 31 unanswered points in a 6 1/2-minute span bridging the second and third quarters.
BYU has not allowed a touchdown in both games it has played against fellow Power Four schools thus far. The Cougars held SMU to five field goals in an 18-15 win over the Mustangs in week two and then limited Kansas State to three field goals on three trips to the red zone on Saturday.
“We already know what we’re capable of,” linebacker Isaiah Glasker said. “It’s really just showing other people what we can do.”
Moa was buried on the running back depth chart to start the season but injuries to LJ Martin and Hinckley Ropati led to the freshman making his first career start. He had just 17 yards on six carries before finishing with 76 yards as BYU’s lead back.
“I was pretty surprised I got a lot of these reps,” Moa said.
A lopsided loss to BYU could send Kansas State tumbling out of the AP Top 25 on Sunday. BYU could also work its way into the rankings.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Even when Justin Fields’ initial plan goes awry, the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback finds a way to prove he should remain ahead of Russell Wilson on the depth chart.
Fields did it again in Sunday’s 27-24 loss at Indianapolis.
Despite being sacked four times, losing one fumble and blaming himself for a botched snap in the final two minutes that led to a game-sealing turnover on downs, Fields ran for two scores and threw for another in the second half to cut a 17-0 deficit to three points with 3:40 left.
It wasn’t enough to recover from a slow start in Pittsburgh’s first loss of the season.
“It’s something we can control,” Fields said. “It’s coming out on game day and executing. Nothing more than that. It’s not complicated. At the end of the day, we feel like we beat ourselves. We knew we were shooting ourselves in the foot.”
Many observers believe Fields has done enough to be named Pittsburgh’s starter over Wilson, who is recovering from a calf injury and was the emergency third quarterback on Sunday.
Fields has completed 70.6% of his throws for 830 yards with three TD passes and one interception with a passer rating of 98.0.
Still, coach Mike Tomlin has been reticent about making an announcement. Even this week, he said he would only make a decision when it became necessary. For now, it’s not.
Alhough Tomlin liked the resilience Fields showed Sunday — completing 22 of 34 passes for 312 yards, including five for 20 yards or more, while leading the Steelers with 55 yards rushing on 10 carries — he wasn’t giving Fields points for effort.


“I’m appreciative of his fight, but I’m not going to congratulate him for it. That’s the nature of the business that we’re in,” Tomlin said. “I appreciate his fight, but he, and me, were a little bit sloppy at times, too sloppy to be able to secure a victory.”

On third-and-10 from Indy’s 33—yard line in the third quarter, Fields tried to avoid the oncoming pass rush by scrambling backward before twisting to make a throw and fumbling. Indy recovered at the Steelers 39 to snuff out the scoring chance.
Then there was the botched snap that cost the Steelers 12 crucial yards on their final possession. Pittsburgh never recovered from a second-and-22 and wound up turning the ball over on downs. Afterward, Fields said he should not have had his head turned when he lifted his leg to indicate it was time to snap the ball.
All he can do now is keep playing well and hope Tomlin rewards him for it.

CONWAY, N.H. (AP) — College football players aspire to play in bowls games. Professional players dream of playing in the Super Bowl. 
A bunch of amateurs in New Hampshire just want to get muddy.
On Sunday, a three-day sloppy, muddy mess wrapped up for the Mud Bowl, which is celebrating its 50th year of football featuring players trudging though knee-deep muck while trying to reach the end zone.
For these athletes, playing in mud brings out their inner child.

“You’re playing football in the mud, so you’ve got to have a smile on your face,” said Jason Veno, the 50-year-old quarterback of the North Country Mud Crocs, who described mud as an equalizer. “It’s just a different game in the mud. It doesn’t matter how good you are on grass. That doesn’t matter in the mud.”
The annual event takes place at Hog Coliseum, located in the heart of North Conway. It kicked off Friday night with revelry and music, followed by a Tournament of Mud Parade on Saturday. All told, a dozen teams with men and women competed in the tournament in hopes of emerging as the soiled victor.

Ryan Martin said he’s been playing mud ball for almost 20 years and said it’s a good excuse to meet up with old friends he’s grown up with.
“You get to a point where you’re just like, I’m not going pro on anything I might as well feel like I’m still competing day in and day out,” he said.

He also acknowledged that the sport has some lingering effects — mostly with mud infiltrating every nook and cranny of his body.


“It gets in the eyes. You get cracks in your feet. And you get mud in your toenails for weeks,” he said. “You get it in your ears too. You’ll be cleaning out your ears for a long while …you’ll be blowing your nose and you’ll get some dirt and you’re like, oh, I didn’t know I still had that there.”

Mahala Smith is also sold on the camaraderie of the event.
She said she fell in love with football early in life and has been playing the sport since first grade and ultimately joined a women’s team for tackle football in 2018 and played that for a few years before she was invited to play in the mud.
She said the weekend was a treat.
“It’s like a little mini vacation and everyone’s all friendly,” she said. “People hang out at the hotels and restaurants, people camp, we all have fires and stuff, just like a nice group event.”

Even though it’s fun, the teams are serious about winning. And the two-hand touch football can get chippy on the field of play, but it’s all fun once the games are over. Many of the players were star high school or college athletes, and there have been a smattering of retired pros over the years, Veno said. 
The theme was “50 Years, The Best of Five Decades.” Over the years, the event has raised more than $1 million for charity, officials said.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Nick Herbig grew up as the youngest of three brothers on the island of Kauai. 
That meant he needed to prove himself if he wanted to hang with the big kids. 
Over and over and over.
“I was always the underdog,” the Pittsburgh Steelers outside linebacker said Wednesday. “I was always expected to be last. Always the smallest. Always the slowest, the shortest, whatever it may be. So I always had a chip on my shoulder.” 
Fast forward a decade or so, and not much has changed. That drive has never left Herbig. Not after a breakout season at Wisconsin in 2022 when he led the Big Ten in sacks. 
Certainly not in Pittsburgh, where Herbig rapidly won over the coaching staff and his teammates with a relentlessness mined from somewhere deep within.
“He’s hardworking and humble, and I really think that tees up performance for him,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. 
“But he also has ridiculous belief in self. And that’s attractive to coaches. That’s attractive to older players. He’s not a guy that’s ever scared.”
Mostly because Herbig figures he never really had a choice. Not with older brothers Jake and Nate — a veteran offensive lineman who joined the Steelers shortly before Pittsburgh selected Nick in the fourth round of the 2023 draft — making him prove it every day growing up on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.
Asked how he managed to get the best of Nate — who at 6-foot-4 and 334 pounds has nearly two inches and 100 pounds on his little brother — and Nick just laughed.


“A lot of hit and run,” he said. “I’m not a scared man, I’m a smart man. So I get my licks in when I can and dip out.”

Which isn’t that far removed from the way Herbig plays. There is a fury that accompanies Herbig at seemingly every snap. He knows he’s a little undersized for the NFL. He knows his job requirements task him with taking on offensive tackles whose shadow he would fit in comfortably. 
Yet he has made being a disruptive force in the backfield commonplace during his burgeoning career. Herbig had three sacks as a rookie in 2023 when he played just 17% of the defensive snaps while receiving a daily close-up on what it takes to excel from All-Pro T.J. Watt and longtime running mate Alex Highsmith.
It hasn’t taken long for Herbig to absorb the lessons Watt and Highsmith dole out with regularity. When Highsmith left Sunday’s 20-10 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers with a groin injury that will force him to miss time, Herbig came on in the third quarter and dropped Los Angeles quarterback Justin Herbert to stall a Chargers drive before it even really began. 
Herbig did it again in the fourth, this time taking down Taylor Heinicke with a speed rush that looked — if you narrowed your eyes a bit — like something straight out of Watt’s toolbox.
It’s not a coincidence. Herbig spent a portion of the summer training alongside Watt in Wisconsin, an experience that Watt described as Herbig being “stuck to my hip, I couldn’t get away from him.”
Herbig does something that makes his No. 51 jump out to Tomlin so often that Tomlin was caught by a microphone during the preseason saying he might need to start calling the 22-year-old “Mr. Herbig,” though don’t expect Watt to give Herbig the same satisfaction.
“Absolutely not, never will,” the three-time NFL sack champion said with a smile.
Still, Watt admits he sees signs of Herbig making the leap from sometimes frantic rookie who gets by on energy alone to a somewhat more refined pass rusher.
“He’s been a sponge to everything and it’s been so cool to see him continue to grow and ask the right questions,” Watt said. “And he’s not afraid to ask questions and then go out and try new moves and fail and get better.”
Steelers left tackle Dan Moore Jr. has seen that development firsthand. There were times last season when Moore and Herbig would be lined up against each other during practice and Moore could tell by Herbig’s stance what was coming. Not so much in 2024.
“I think he’s just doing a better job of setting things up this year, making things look the same,” Moore said.
Herbig will likely have to expand his repertoire as his resume grows. He will likely make his first NFL start on Sunday when the Steelers (3-0) visit Indianapolis (1-2). 
He’s fully prepared for the Colts to test him and see if he’s big enough and strong enough to set the edge on running plays, a part of Herbig’s game that remains very much in development. 
He also understands that for all the attention he might get for finding his way to the quarterback, there is another level he needs to get to. 
Yes, Watt is putting together a Hall of Fame career because of the sacks he racks up. Yet Watt is hardly a pass-rush specialist. The lesson in that isn’t lost on Herbig.
“I think if you want to be an elite player and play at an elite level, you got to play all three downs,” Herbig said.
He’s off to a good start. But he’s hardly arrived. And Herbig knows that better than anyone. There is much work to be done and more doubters to silence.
“I’m not supposed to be here,” he said. “I’m just from Kauai, like 60,000 people in the middle of the ocean. So, you know, I’ve got to have (an) edge to get here.”

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Armorion Smith pressed his palms together over the bridge of his nose, closed his eyes and leaned against the kitchen sink.
The 21-year-old Michigan State defensive back needed a moment in the four-bedroom, two-bathroom home he shares with five younger siblings. He has a lot on his plate, more than most college students and certainly more than most student-athletes.
His mother, Gala Gilliam, died of breast cancer a month ago and without a father in the family’s life, Smith has become the head of the household while studying criminal justice and playing major college football. He became the legal guardian for four siblings on Sept. 11.

“My cards were given to me,” Smith said softly with a steely gaze, standing on a small porch behind the home as the sun set on a recent evening. “I didn’t choose my deck of cards.”
His 19-year-old sister, Aleion, is in charge while he is gone for about 12 hours most days to be a student and athlete. Appreciating her selfless sacrifice, Smith said he hopes to help her find a way to start taking classes next semester while juggling her role with the family.
Smith looks and sounds determined to help his siblings be happy, healthy and safe. His teammates watch in awe.
“I couldn’t even begin to imagine if I was in his situation,” linebacker Jordan Hall said. “He’s in a tough spot, but he is one of the strongest guys I have ever known.”


Smith grew up in in Detroit, recalling how he was homeless at times and hopped from house to house to find places to sleep. He was a three-star prospect at River Rouge High School and attended the University of Cincinnati for two years.
After Smith’s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2022 during his sophomore season with the Bearcats, he transferred last year to be closer to home. The life lessons from his mom continued.
When Smith, holding his 2-year-old sister, arrived at a recent fundraiser, each of his other siblings introduced themselves to people there to support the family and shook their hands while making eye contact.
“That’s from my mom,” he said.
She was trying to prepare him for what was to come before she died Aug. 19. She was 41.

“She used to tell me everything: ‘Get hard’ and all of that,” he recalled. “And I see why she was under a lot of stress.”
Smith keeps notes on his phone to help manage busy days that start before dawn, when he is up to make sure his two sisters and three brothers are awake before he leaves for school. Smith gets a lift from a teammate or a ride-hailing service to make the 4-mile trip to campus for therapy on his surgically repaired shoulders and meetings with the football team before going to classes and practice.
His eldest sister gets their 16- and 15-year-old brothers, Armond and Avaugn, and 11-year-old sister, Arial, ready for school. There are two varieties of Cap’n Crunch atop the refrigerator in a kitchen that didn’t have a table or chairs during a recent visit.
The school-age brothers rely on a ride-hailing company to get them to school and back while their oldest sister cares for their toddler sister, Amaira.
“Me and my sister got to work together to keep this all afloat,” he said. “While I’m in college sports, she’s got to be able to take care of everything that I can’t do, like pick up where I left off, while I’m taking care of business.”
He and the siblings he is now responsible for at least have a home thanks in part to a GoFundMe campaign.
While Smith’s story is unusual in college sports — the NCAA does not track the number of athletes whose day-to-day activities include caring for a dependent — a 2020 study from the National Center for Education Statistics found 19.5% of undergraduate college students had a dependent and 5.5% of them were responsible for non-child dependents. Other research shows student-caregivers are disproportionately from historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups.
Ray Ray McElrathbey was a 19-year-old freshman at Clemson in 2006 when he took over custody of his 10-year-old brother because of his mother’s drug problems and his father’s gambling addiction. Initially, they lived solely off McElrathbey’s scholarship and later the NCAA approved a plan where donations were administered by a local bank and distributed to Ray and Fahmarr. His story was the subject of “Safety,” a Disney movie.
When McElrathbey was a child and saw “Angels in the Outfield,” it inspired him because he felt there were other children out there like him. These days, he does speaking engagements and shares his message of hope with young people.
“Just kind to speak to those kids in a similar situation like I was growing up and have them have something to inspire them is the greatest gift,” he said.

Tufts University professor Emma Armstrong-Carter, who has done research on children caregivers, said these young people show amazing strength and don’t want to be pitied.
“Isn’t it incredible that these young people are able to overcome so many challenges and support their families in ways that are necessary and meaningful?” Armstrong-Carter said. “There’s a need for more institutional support to help them thrive.”
Smith and his family are able to afford renting a house in the state capital, paying for utilities, bills, food and ride-hailing services thanks to waves of financial support. The GoFundMe effort has raised more than $60,000, and he makes some money through name, image and likeness deals. Michigan State has helped through a student assistance fund. Two fundraisers were hosted at a McDonald’s in Lansing and an IHOP in Livonia set up by former Michigan State football players Jason Strayhorn and Sedrick Irvin and promoted on their “This is Sparta MSU” podcast.
Road trips are part of the calendar and the Spartans don’t play two home games in a row until the end of the season in November, though two bye weekends will give Smith more time at home. 
One of his mother’s close friends, Yolanda Wilson, whose son, Nick Marsh, is a standout freshman receiver and former high school teammate, has been a source of support.
“I’m going to be there no matter what,” she said. “That’s a promise I made to their mother. And they have everybody here backing them up. So, it’s going to be a hard transition as it is, but we’re going to be that tight-knit community and have their back.”
The love is not lost on Smith.
“Me and my family are very happy, very appreciative and grateful,” he said. “There’s a lot of love Spartan Nation has shown us these past few months. It’s been a rough time, but to be able to take some of the stress off of my shoulders and show me a lot of love is a blessing and has warmed my heart.”

When Smith gave The Associated Press access to his home one recent evening, three siblings were upstairs in their bedrooms while a teenage brother was napping on a sectional couch in a living room without a TV or table. His toddler sister giggled between drinks from a sippy cup.
“It just puts a smile on my face to see them happy,” he said while watching video clips from practice on his phone.
Smith’s sadness comes and goes, but he knows his mother would want him to carry on.
“I can feel her living through me,” he said. “Almost like I hear her voice telling me how proud she is of me.”
This story has been corrected to show that Smith’s 11-year old sibling is his sister, not brother.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — After Jalen Hurts and the Eagles fell behind by 24 points and didn’t cross midfield until the second quarter following a dismal start Sunday, coach Nick Sirianni said Philadelphia has to “make some changes.” 
The Eagles were held without an offensive yard for more than a quarter of their 33-16 loss to Tampa Bay in the first matchup between the teams since the Buccaneers’ one-sided playoff win last season.
“We got to make some changes as far as what is going fundamentally,” Sirianni said. 
Tampa Bay ended Philadelphia’s season for the second time in three years last January. Hurts is 1-4 against Tampa Bay, the lone victory coming in Week 3 of last season.
“I just have to play better,” Hurts said, “Production. Taking care of the ball. Just the efficiency.”
Tom Brady beat Hurts in the regular season and playoffs in 2021, and a 32-9 playoff loss to Baker Mayfield capped a stunning 2023 collapse that saw Philadelphia lose six of seven games after a 10-1 start.
The Eagles were coming off a 15-12 win at New Orleans. The Bucs, on the other hand, had a frustrating 26-7 home loss to Denver.
Most of the first half saw the Eagles completely misfire on offense, miss tackles, and block a Bucs’ defender into their punt returner that resulted in a muff which Tampa Bay recovered.
Philadelphia trailed 24-0 midway through the second quarter and had been outgained 254-0 over the stretch.


“No excuses for that,” Sirianni said. “We didn’t coach well enough. We didn’t play well enough.”
Tampa Bay ran 22 plays in Eagles territory before the Philadelphia offense crossed the 50-yard line in the second quarter.

Hurts threw a touchdown pass to Parris Campbell late in the second and added a one-yard TD run on the opening possession of the third to make it 24-14.
Down 30-16 late in the third, Hurts moved the Eagles to the Bucs 19 before linebacker Lavonte David sacked him, and forced a key fumble.
Hurts finished 18 of 30 for 150 yards and no interceptions. He was sacked six times
Saquon Barkley rushed for 94 yards on 10 carries. He had a 59-day dash on the Eagles’ first play in the second half. 
The Eagles’ receiver corps remained short-handed with A.J. Brown’s missing his third consecutive game with a hamstring injury. DeVonta Smith suffered a concussion a week ago against New Orleans and was also out. Britain Covey was placed on injured reserve this week with a shoulder injury.
Pro Bowl tackle Lane Johnson sat out with a concussion.
“We got to get everybody healthy,” Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert said. “We got to get people out there. But we’ve got to make sure all locked in and focused on the details. We’ve got to focus on little things.”

PARIS (AP) — The Paralympic Games ended Sunday with two world records and a spectacular light show during a closing ceremony dominated by French electronic music
Jean-Michel Jarre got the party underway at the Stade de France, coaxing dance moves from athletes, volunteers and spectators on a day when Morocco’s Fatima Ezzahra El Idrissi smashed the world record in the women’s marathon for runners with visual impairments and Nigeria’s Folashade Oluwafemiayo of Nigeria broke her own world record in women’s para powerlifting.
El Idrissi ran the 42-kilometer (26.2 mile) course in 2 hours, 48 minutes, 36 seconds, beating the previous record from Japan’s Misato Michishita in Hofu City in December 2020 by nearly six minutes.
“I wasn’t running for a time, only for a medal,” the 29-year-old Moroccan said. 
Compatriot Meryem En-Nourhi was just over nine minutes behind, followed by Michishita, almost 15 minutes behind the winner.
Elena Congost thought she’d won bronze, but the Spanish runner was later disqualified for releasing the tether to her guide, Mia Carol Bruguera, before the finish. 
Michishita only found out she was upgraded to bronze while on her way to doping control.
Tunisia’s Wajdi Boukhili won the men’s T12 marathon in 2 hours, 22 minutes, 5 seconds.
Swiss wheelchair racers Catherine Debrunner and Marcel Hug won the women’s and men’s marathons for the T53/54 catagories.


Tatyana McFadden, the most decorated American wheelchair racer, was seventh in the women’s race, just over 12 minutes behind Debrunner. The 35-year-old leaves Paris with a silver medal from the 100 and bronze from the 4x100 universal relay.
British wheelchair racer David Weir announced his Paralympic retirement at age 45 after finishing fifth in the men’s race. 
Weir won six Paralympic golds, including four at the London Games in 2012, when he won the marathon, but failed to medal in three Games since. 
Weir said he will still compete in individual races, including the Berlin Marathon on Sept. 29.
After the marathons, spectators paid tribute to Ugandan Olympic runner Rebecca Cheptegei, who died Thursday after she was set on fire in what police said was an attack by her partner.
Cheptegei ran the marathon at the Paris Olympics last month, and an image of her celebrating was shown on a large screen near the finish line Sunday as the crowd was asked to observe a minute’s applause in her memory. The announcer referred to Cheptegei as a “victim of femicide.”
The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said Friday that the city wants to honor Cheptegei by naming a sports venue after her.
The Netherlands’ women’s team defended its gold medal in wheelchair basketball with a 63-49 win over the United States in the final.
Bo Kramer contributed 23 points and Mariska Beijer 22 as the Dutch made their experience count before an appreciative crowd at a packed Bercy Arena.
Trailing 48-37 going into the fourth quarter, the American players clasped hands as they listened to coach Christina Schwab’s team-talk. Ixhelt Gonzalez lifted their hopes with 2 points on a break, but Kramer responded with two frees and then a 3-point shot to underline Dutch control. 
“For us as a team, I don’t really feel like we peaked,” said Rose Hollermann, who scored 17 for the U.S. “I think we have a lot left in our tank. I never felt like we got into that flow state as a team, so I’m really proud that it finished with the silver medal.”
The 28-year-old Hollermann was already looking forward.
“There’s a lot more left for us, and I think that’s a great feeling for us as a team, that we can take that and go back and get back to work,” she said.
Canada lost to China 65-43 earlier in the bronze-medal match.
“I’d like to go back two hours. I’d like to restart that game,” Canada coach Michele Sung said.
Defending champion Oluwafemiayo twice bettered her own world record in women’s para powerlifting by bench-pressing 167 kilograms above her chest for another gold in the final for women over 86kg.
The 39-year-old Oluwafemiayo beat her previous best mark from Tbilisi in Georgia in June by one kilo by lifting 166 in round three. Oluwafemiayo then delighted spectators at La Chapelle Arena by adding another kilo to the record in a powerlift.
Iran’s Ahmad Aminzadeh won the men’s final for athletes over 107kg with a lift of 263. It was the last gold medal from 549 awarded at the Games.
China claimed almost twice as many gold medals – 94 to Britain’s 49 – as any other country during the Paralympics in Paris.
Altogether, China finished with 220 medals (94 gold, 76 silver, 50 bronze), compared to 124 for next-best Britain, followed by 105 for the U.S. Britain’s total included 44 silver and 31 bronze, while the U.S. finished with 36 gold, 42 silver and 27 bronze medals.
Brazilian athletes won 89 medals, but Dutch athletes won more gold – 27 compared to Brazil’s 25. 
Host nation France finished eighth in the medal table with 19 gold medals among its total of 75. 
This story has been corrected to show that China won the bronze-medal match in women’s wheelchair basketball, not Canada.

Murder charges filed against the father of a 14-year-old boy accused of a Georgia school shooting follow the successful prosecution of two parents in Michigan who were held responsible for a similar tragedy at a school north of Detroit.
Is it a sign of a crackdown on parents accused of gross negligence when it comes to kids and guns? Could public outrage lead to more prosecutions or changes in law in other states, too? 
“It’s a matter of looking at the relationship between what the child says and does and what the parent knows about what the child says and does,” said David Shapiro, a former prosecutor who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.
Colin Gray, 54, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and second-degree murder related to the deaths of two students and two teachers at Apalachee High School in Winder, outside Atlanta. Nine more people were wounded.
Gray’s son, Colt Gray, is charged with murder. Investigators said he used a “semi-automatic AR-15 style rifle” in the attack.
The charges against Colin Gray “are directly connected with the actions of his son and allowing him to possess a weapon,” said Chris Hosey, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
James and Jennifer Crumbley were convicted of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year for the deaths of four students at Oxford High School in 2021. It was the first time that parents were held criminally responsible for a U.S. mass school shooting. They’re serving 10-year prison terms while appeals are pending.


The Crumbleys didn’t know what son Ethan Crumbley was planning. But prosecutor Karen McDonald said their son’s actions were foreseeable. They were summoned to discuss the 15-year-old’s macabre drawings of a gun and blood on a math assignment and a message, “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me. My life is useless.” 
The Crumbleys declined to take him home but said they would seek counseling. On that same day, Ethan Crumbley removed a gun from his backpack and began shooting, using a weapon that James Crumbley had purchased as a gift just a few days earlier. No one — parents or school staff — had checked the backpack.
The parents’ “actions and inactions were inexorably intertwined” with what their son ultimately did at Oxford, the Michigan Court of Appeals said in 2023 when the groundbreaking case was allowed to move forward.
Prosecutor Brad Smith declined to publicly disclose details that led him to charge Colin Gray in the Apalachee shooting. But in arrest warrants, authorities said he had provided a gun to his son “with knowledge that he was threat to himself and others.” 
Smith acknowledged the Michigan case during a news conference Friday and said his case was a first for Georgia.
“I’m not trying to send a message,” he said. “I’m just trying to use the tools in my arsenal to prosecute people for the crimes they commit.”
Colin Gray was interviewed last year when authorities were investigating his son about a menacing post on social media. The father said the teen “knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them,” according to a transcript. Nothing more was pursued.
McDonald, the prosecutor in Michigan, said the Georgia shooting and the father’s arrest was a “real punch in the stomach.”
“I can’t believe the facts that stood out as so egregious in our case seem to be so similar,” she told The Associated Press. 
McDonald said states have laws that carry consequences for gross negligence in various situations. She said it’s encouraging that police in Georgia immediately investigated how the gun was obtained.
“I have never felt it was a moment that would open the floodgates to charges against parents or sending a message to people,” McDonald said of the Crumbley case. “Most people don’t need that message. It’s heartbreaking to watch it play out.”
She said it takes only seconds to put a lock on a gun, which she demonstrated for a jury.
Shapiro, the former New Jersey prosecutor, said all states likely have laws that can be used to hold parents responsible, though much depends on the facts and a prosecutor’s views.
“You don’t want to be able to allow parents to overlook those kinds of signs there is something seriously wrong or a serious risk,” he said.
Michigan has a new law this year that requires adults to keep guns locked up when minors are present. In Newaygo County, a grandfather pleaded no contest in August in the death of a 5-year-old grandson. Another boy had picked up and fired a loaded shotgun. 
“If people simply locked up their firearms, we would not be putting parents behind bars for this reason,” said Kris Brown, the president of Brady, a gun violence prevention group. “And we would not be digging as many graves.”

Motorsports icon Michael Andretti told The Associated Press on Sunday he’s at a point in his life where he no longer wants to run the day-to-day of his global operation and that’s why he turned over leadership to his business partner.
No, Dan Towriss did not steal Andretti Global out from under one of the most successful racers in American history.
Towriss, owner of Gainbridge and holding company Group 1001, has slowly grown from a sponsor of one of Andretti’s IndyCar teams to one of the biggest spenders in motorsports. But at least two years ago, Towriss bought an ownership stake in Andretti Global and became part of the entire organization.
And no, Andretti said with firm denial, he was not pushed out of IndyCar by series owner Roger Penske. “Absolutely not. I would not give Roger that much credit,” Andretti told AP.
Andretti and Penske were at odds the entire season when Andretti opened the year by calling on Penske to sell IndyCar if Penske wasn’t willing to spend the capital to properly market the series.
The real reason for him stepping away, Andretti told AP, is that he turns 62 next week and has spent his entire life in racing. His father, Mario, is a Formula 1 world champion, Indianapolis 500 winner and four-time IndyCar champion.
Michael Andretti has twin 10-year-old children, two weeks ago became “Nonno” for the first time when son Marco welcomed a daughter, and has multiple business entities to fill his time. 


For reasons Andretti, who is a bit of introvert, couldn’t even explain, it was simply time for him to take a step back. He will still have some sort of role — he doesn’t know what or how many races he’ll even go to — but the name Andretti Global will remain intact. 
“We’ve been working on this for a few months now. For me where I am in my life and what I want to do, the timing was right for me to take a little different role with the team,” Andretti told AP. “A role where I don’t have to be on it every day and I can still stay involved because I’ll be involved as an advisor as well as an ambassador. We were able to come to a deal between myself and Dan and I think we are both happy with what we came up with.”
Andretti Global fields cars in IndyCar for Colton Herta, who won the series finale and finished second in the final standings, Marcus Ericsson and Kyle Kirkwood. It fields teams across seven total series and on Monday will give female driver Jamie Chadwick a test in an Indy car. Andretti Global also supports the two teen young sons of the late Dan Wheldon.
Both Andretti and Towriss declined to discuss their efforts to join F1, which has been an ongoing battle in which the owners of F1 and the majority of the teams have been vehemently against expansion. Part of the issues seemed to be personal in that the leaders of F1 simply don’t like the Andretti’s.
With Towriss now in charge and Andretti more window dressing, it is not clear if that changes F1’s opinion of Andretti Global’s hopes to join the series. Neither would even say if they are still pursuing F1.
Towriss told AP that in his role leading a global financial firm, he doesn’t envision himself running the day-to-day operations of Andretti Global and that the current leadership team is likely to stay in place. Andretti still holds an ownership stake in the organization, Towriss said, and no drivers have contracts that are voidable if Andretti Global restructures leadership.
The two spoke to AP on Sunday before they’ve even had a chance to speak to the Andretti Global employees in an attempt to get ahead of salacious rumors and unfounded reports that Andretti was pushed out of the team he’s run since 2002 by Towriss.
The duo had planned to announce the restructuring in the coming months but were beat to it by a Friday report in Sportico, a publication owned by Roger Penske’s son, Jay. The dots began to be connected, Andretti and Towriss figure, once IndyCar team owners agreed to a new charter agreement and it was Towriss who signed on behalf of Andretti Global.
The two denied the Sportico characterization that Andretti relinquished “his ownership stake” in Andretti Global.
“We didn’t say that he doesn’t own our team. There’s all kinds of speculation,” Towriss said. “We certainly have restructured the ownership. Michael still has a financial interest. This got leaked in a way that put us on our back foot in terms of responding to things. People are going to always look to try to fill a vacuum with stories that sound great and are super interesting. This one is not super interesting. Michael said this was a time to take on a different role from the daily grind.”
Andretti’s 42 career victories rank fifth on IndyCar’s all-time win list, but he’d long ranked third behind A.J. Foyt and his Mario Andretti until active drivers Scott Dixon and Will Power passed him on the list. Andretti drivers have won the Indianapolis 500 five times — Mario Andretti is the only family member to achieve the accomplishment — and has not won the IndyCar title since 2012.
The team this past season scaled from four cars to three, lost sponsor DHL to rival Chip Ganassi Racing, and Herta’s two victories were the only two wins of the season for Andretti in IndyCar. It took Herta’s season-ending victory to surge him to second in the final standings.
Despite the results and the longtime slump, Towriss remained adamant that Andretti Global can still compete with Team Penske, Ganassi and Arrow McLaren. Ganassi just won his third championship in four years, while Penske has won back-to-back Indianapolis 500s.
“Colton came in second in points, Kyle had a great year, it was a transition year for Marcus, but I’m really confident in how he’s going to do next year,” Towriss said. “In terms of the number of championships won, they have been Penske and Ganassi drivers, and that’s a target to shoot for. But I would bristle at any notion that Andretti Global is a ”B Team” in IndyCar.” 
Andretti said he’ll for sure be at the Indianapolis 500 this year, where son Marco has a contract to run for the team. Beyond that? He doesn’t know.
“I’m 62 years old and you know, you only have so many years left to do things,” Andretti said. “I’ve got a lot of great things happen for me in my life, and now is the time to enjoy some of them.”

EUGENE, Ore. (AP) — Oregon is clearly still trying to find an identity. 
For the second straight week the Ducks struggled, but ultimately prevailed. Atticus Sappington kicked a 25-yard field goal as time expired to give No. 7 Oregon a 37-34 victory over resilient Boise State on Saturday night.
Dillon Gabriel threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns for the Ducks (2-0), who trailed the Broncos (1-1) with 10 minutes left.
Last week, Oregon beat Idaho 24-14, another game that was closer than expected. 
“As a team that’s finding our identity together, I think you see a bunch of guys being more and more connected as the weeks go on, through practice, through games,” Gabriel said. “And then you go through adversity and you find a way to win.” 
Ashton Jeanty ran for 192 yards and three touchdowns for Boise State, which went into the game as 18 1/2-point underdogs but nearly pulled off the upset. 
The Broncos (1-1) went back ahead 34-27 early in the fourth quarter on Jeanty’s 8-yard scoring run, but Noah Whittington had a 99-yard kickoff return that ended with Jayden Limar’s recovery in the end zone to tie it 16 seconds later. 
Despite the struggles, Oregon extended its nonconference home winning streak to 34 games, best nationally among active teams. 
“I have a sense of relief because of the result,” Oregon coach Dan Lanning said. “But, try to focus on the process, and there’s a lot of things I think we can go and attack and fix. And there’s certainly some things to fix, right? There’s certainly some things to improve.”


Boise State took the early lead with Jonah Dalmas’ first-quarter field goal. Oregon’s offense sputtered at the start, but Gabriel hit Evan Stewart with a 67-yard pass and then scored on a keeper. 
Jeanty ran for a 3-yard TD early in the second quarter before Dillon hit Stewart with a 34-yard scoring pass to give Oregon a 14-10 edge. 
The Broncos went ahead on Maddux Madsen’s 17-yard TD pass to Cameron Camper. They added a 20-yard field goal to lead 20-14 at halftime. 
The Ducks were ranked No. 3 in the AP Top 25 heading into the season, but dropped to No. 7 after an underwhelming 24-14 victory over Idaho in the opener. 
Issues on the Ducks’ offensive line appeared to continue against Boise State. Gabriel was sacked four times in the first half alone, including on Oregon’s first series. The line was shuffled several times during the game. 
Boise State safety Alexander Teubner was ejected for targeting early in the third quarter. On the same drive, Gabriel passed to Traeshon Holden, who sprinted downfield untouched for a 59-yard TD. Oregon missed the extra point, knotting the score at 20. 
Tez Johnson had an 85-yard punt return to give the Ducks a 27-20 lead, but Jeanty tied it up again with a 70-yard touchdown dash early in the fourth quarter after Boise State recovered an Oregon fumble. 
Last season Jeanty scored 19 touchdowns (14 via receptions and five on the run) and averaged 159.7 all-purpose yards per game, second in the nation. He ran for 267 yards and six touchdowns, both school records, in Boise State’s season-opening victory over Georgia Southern. 
Jeanty’s 8-yard run put Boise State briefly in front with 10:15 to play before Limar’s TD recovery tied it. 
“I’m proud of our team,” Boise State coach Spencer Danielson said. “We didn’t finish the way we need to, we need to find a way to win that game. We’re going to look at it, learn and grow from it, and we’re going to be a better football team because of what we went through tonight.”
The Broncos had won the three previous meetings with Oregon with the last of those games coming in 2017. 
Boise State: Boise State was picked in the preseason to finish atop the Mountain West Conference, and the team certainly held its own against the Ducks. ... Offensive lineman Roger Carreon injured his left leg in the first quarter and was carted off the field. ... The Broncos have never defeated a Big Ten team. 
Oregon: The Ducks went into the game as 18 1/2-point favorites according to BetMGM sportsbook. ... James Jordan ran for 102 yards on 17 carries ... Stewart had five catches for 112 yards and a TD. ... Former Duck Payton Pritchard, who won an NBA title with the Boston Celtics, was among those at the game. 
Boise State: Hosts Portland State on Saturday, Sept. 21. 
Oregon: At Oregon State on Saturday.

NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Oklahoma coach Brent Venables has named true freshman Michael Hawkins Jr. the Sooners’ new starting quarterback over Jackson Arnold for Saturday’s game at Auburn.
Venables made the announcement on his weekly radio show on Monday night.
Arnold turned the ball over three times in the first half of a 25-15 loss to Tennessee on Saturday night. The former five-star recruit completed 7 of 16 passes for 54 yards with an interception, and had five carries for minus-21 yards with two lost fumbles before being replaced. His mistakes were the key reason Tennessee led 19-3 at halftime.
Hawkins sparked the Sooners in the second half, leading Venables to declare the position open. He completed 11 of 18 passes for 132 yards and a touchdown, and ran for 22 yards as Oklahoma outscored the Volunteers 12-6 in the second half. 
After the loss, Oklahoma (3-1, 0-1 Southeastern Conference) fell from No. 15 to No. 21 in the AP Top 25.

LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — This was supposed to be the breakthrough year at Kansas, when a program Lance Leipold built from nationwide laughingstock to respectability took another step into the upper echelon of the Big 12 and, just maybe, the College Football Playoff.
All of which could still happen. But it would take a dramatic turn of events.
After starting the season in the AP Top 25, the Jayhawks have lost back-to-back games to fall out altogether. The latest was Saturday night, a 23-20 loss to UNLV in which Kansas dragged itself down with nine penalties, a defensive collapse that led to a touchdown to end the first half, and more ill-advised throws from veteran quarterback Jalon Daniels.
The one-time Heisman Trophy candidate had four turnovers the previous week in a 23-17 loss at Illinois. Daniels threw two more picks against the Runnin’ Rebels, giving him six this season, and he has just 442 yards and three TDs passing.
“He’s playing hard, but he’s not playing like the Jalon that we know,” Leipold admitted, before adding: “I’m going to put this on me. I’m not going to put it on the kids right now. We’ve got to figure out a better way to stay in rhythm and do it.”
The Jayhawks’ defense has kept them in both of their losses, holding UNLV to just 267 yards on Saturday night. That included 92 yards in the second half, and 39 on the ground, when Kansas should have been building upon its 17-13 halftime lead.


Instead, the Jayhawks managed only a field goal in the fourth quarter. And when they did get the ball back following UNLV’s go-ahead touchdown with 2 minutes to go, they were unable to produce another field goal that would have forced overtime.
Just how bad has the offense been under new coordinator Jeff Grimes? Kansas is last in the Big 12 in yards passing, averaging a meager 164.3 per game, and better than only Colorado, Iowa State and Houston in scoring at 28.3 points per game.
“We have to be able to finish,” Daniels said. “Our defense was out there on the field making plays left and right, and our offense has to be out there helping those guys out. We have to go in there and find a way to be better.”
Right away — because the sense of urgency is real with Big 12 play starting at West Virginia on Saturday.
Kansas is coming off back-to-back bowl games, and its nine wins were its most since 2007, when Mark Mangino was still on the sideline and the Jayhawks won the Orange Bowl. The school is in the midst of a massive rebuild of its on-campus football stadium, along with renovations that touch just about every other aspect of the program. And that energy has trickled down to a once-weary fanbase that packed Children’s Mercy Park for the Jayhawks’ two nonconference home games.
And with Oklahoma and Texas departing the Big 12 for the SEC this season, there were plenty of folks around Kansas — like a lot of other schools in the league — who viewed a sudden power vacuum atop the conference. Someone would wrestle control of the Big 12, and its spot in the College Football Playoff, and why couldn’t it be the Jayhawks?
That opportunity still exists, because their two losses have been out-of-conference games. The playoff system presently in place means those defeats are far less damaging than they might have been in past years.
Kansas will play its remaining home games at Arrowhead Stadium, the home of the Chiefs, and whether its 80,000 seats will be filled or empty for the Big 12 schedule will reflect whether the Jayhawks have been able to get back on track.
“We’ve got to reset all over again,” Daniels said. “At the end of the day, we still have the standard we go by every single day. We believe that abiding by that standard day-in and day-out, no matter what happens, will allow us to get the outcome we want.”

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Jake Bauers drove in the go-ahead run with a pinch-hit infield single that capped a four-run eighth inning as the Milwaukee Brewers overcame an eight-run deficit and avoided a series sweep, rallying for a 10-9 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday.
The Brewers trailed 8-0 in the third before chipping away and tying that game at 9 by scoring three runs with two outs in the eighth inning. Jackson Chourio walked, took second on Blake Perkins’ single, and scored on Garrett Mitchell’s RBI single to make it 9-7. Justin Martinez (5-6) relieved and Rhys Hoskins tied it with a two-run single to left.
Willy Adames doubled and Hoskins advanced to third base before Bauers hit a run-scoring, slow-rolling grounder for a single to the left side. 
Milwaukee’s comeback from the eight-run deficit matched the franchise’s second-largest. The Seattle Pilots overcame an 11-3 deficit to beat Washington 16-13 on May 10, 1969, and the Brewers gave up eight first-inning runs to Cleveland in a 12-9 win on May 20, 1986. The Brewers’ only larger comeback was when they trailed Cincinnati by nine runs in the fourth inning on April 28, 2004, and won 10-9.
Jared Koenig (9-4) earned the win and the Brewers’ Devin Williams worked a scoreless ninth for his 13th save in 14 chances. It was the fourth time in franchise history the Brewers have rallied to win from a deficit of eight or more runs.
“The Brewers don’t shut down with two outs,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. “They get even more stubborn with two outs. They did it to us for several days at Chase (Field) and it continued today.”


Milwaukee rallied within 8-4 with a run in the third, two in the fourth and an unearned run in the sixth. Milwaukee made it 8-6 in the seventh on RBI doubles by Hoskins and Adames.
“If you slice it up any possible way, you can’t give up seven runs in three innings,” Lovullo said. “You’re going to lose a lot of baseball that way, if that’s what coming out of your bullpen. That is not our bullpen. They’re going to pick it up.”
Arizona (87-69) remained behind San Diego in the race for the NL wild card. The New York Mets, also in the wild-card race, play Sunday night against Philadelphia. Milwaukee (89-67), which clinched the NL Central title Wednesday, remained the only team in the major leagues this season without a losing streak of four or more games.
“Let me tell you what we learned,” Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. “We’re not good enough, after all we’ve been through, and all the injuries and adversity that we’ve faced this year — we’ve all been through it and it’s old — we’re not good enough to take our foot off the gas.”
Randal Grichuk’s pinch-hit RBI single in the eighth off Jared Koenig (9-4) put Arizona up 9-6. Mitchell answered with an RBI single in the bottom half.
“It’s nice to see that we didn’t roll over,” Hoskin said. “Totally could have. That’s a good team over there, that’s what they done to us these last three nights.”
Josh Bell and Eugenio Suárez homered in a seven-run third inning off Milwaukee starter Frankie Montas (7-12), who lasted just 2 2/3 innings. Geraldo Perdomo tripled into the corner in right field with one out and raced home on an errant throw by second baseman Brice Turang.
Arizona loaded the bases on a single, walk and catcher’s interference. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. followed with an RBI ground-out and Jake McCarthy delivered a two-run single to right, giving Arizona a 5-0 lead.
Bell followed with his 19th homer, a 436-foot shot to center, and Suarez added his 29th homer to put the Diamondbacks in front 8-0.
Montas was tagged for eight runs, seven earned, on six hits, with two walks and four strikeouts.
Ketel Marte put the Diamondbacks up 1-0 with one out in the first with his career-high 35th home run.
Diamondbacks: RHP Ryne Nelson, on the injured list retroactive to Sept. 11 due to right shoulder inflammation threw a bullpen session, although manager Torey Lovullo did not have an update. “I would have heard it if it wasn’t good,” Lovullo said Sunday. Nelson was 6-1 with a 3.59 ERA over his last 15 games, including 14 starts. … C Gabriel Moreno was removed in the fourth inning with left adductor tightness.
Diamondbacks: Left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez (3-3, 5:09 ERA) starts for Arizona on Monday in the opener of a three-game series against. San Francisco, opposed by right-hander Hayden Birdsong (4-5, 4.74). 
Brewers: After an off day on Monday, open a three-game series on Tuesday at Pittsburgh.

NEW YORK (AP) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams vowed to stay in office Thursday after federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment accusing him of letting Turkish officials and businesspeople buy his influence with illegal campaign contributions and lavish overseas trips.
Adams, a Democrat, faces conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery charges in a five-count indictment outlining a decade-long trail of corruption that began when he served as an elected official in Brooklyn and continued through his mayoral administration.
AP AUDIO: AP correspondent Julie Walker reports New York City’s mayor under indictment says he’s not stepping down and is a political target.
Among other things, prosecutors say Adams received free and steeply discounted flight upgrades valued at more than $100,000, free stays in opulent hotel suites and expensive meals, as well as campaign contributions from straw donors, some of which helped him qualify for more than $10 million in matching public campaign funds.
“I want to be clear, these upgrades and freebies were not part of some frequent flyer or benefits program available to the general public,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said at a news conference. “This was a multiyear scheme to buy favor from a single New York City official on the rise.” 
In exchange for the bribes, Adams took actions that appeared to benefit Turkey’s leaders, including expediting the fire safety inspection at a consulate building and not releasing a statement on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, according to the indictment.


Adams had a duty to disclose gifts he received, but year after year “kept the public in the dark,” the U.S. attorney said. 
Speaking outside Gracie Mansion, Adams denied wrongdoing and said he doesn’t plan to resign. Flanked by prominent Black clergy members, Adams, who is the city’s second Black mayor, lashed out at federal prosecutors and suggested he had been unfairly targeted.
“I ask New Yorkers to wait to hear our defense before making any judgments,” he said. “From here, my attorneys will take care of the case so I can take care of the city.”
Adams’ arraignment was scheduled for noon on Friday before Magistrate Judge Katharine Parker.
The indictment brought a stunning crescendo to the drumbeat of federal investigations that has engulfed the mayor and his top aides in recent weeks, prompting resignations from his police commissioner, schools chancellor and top legal adviser.
While Adams faced calls to resign from Republicans and several of his likely opponents in next June’s mayoral primary, top Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries stopped short of asking him to step down and instead said the legal process should play out.
Gov. Kathy Hochul has the power to remove Adams from office. In a statement Thursday, she said she’s considering the options. “I expect the Mayor to take the next few days to review the situation and find an appropriate path forward to ensure the people of New York City are being well-served by their leaders.”
If Adams were to resign, he would be immediately replaced by Jumaane Williams, a progressive Democrat who serves as the city’s public advocate. Williams would then schedule a special election. In a statement Thursday, Williams said Adams’ time to show he can effectively govern and regain the city’s trust “is rapidly running out.”
Adams spent 22 years in New York City’s police department before going into politics, first as a state senator and then as Brooklyn borough president, a largely ceremonial position but one that gave him a springboard to run for mayor in 2021.
FBI agents initially seized Adams’ electronic devices nearly a year ago as part of an investigation focused on campaign contributions during his mayoral run as well as Adams’ interactions with the Turkish government and the Turkish American business community. Since then, he has been asked repeatedly at news conferences about his frequent global trips over the years and who paid for them.
Adams said there was nothing nefarious about his trips and that he never did anything improper in exchange for campaign money.
But prosecutors allege that Adams sought and accepted illegal contributions funneled to his campaign through an unnamed official in the Turkish diplomatic establishment. The official arranged for Adams and his companions to receive free or discounted travel on Turkey’s national airline to destinations including France, China, Sri Lanka, India, Hungary, and Turkey, the indictment contends.
Additionally, Adams sought contributions from foreign officials — who are banned by law from donating to U.S. political candidates — then “compounded his gains” by gaming the city’s matching funds program, which provides a generous match for small-dollar donations, prosecutors allege. In total, his campaign received more than $10 million in matching public funds, which are only supposed to be available to candidates who play by the rules, according to the indictment.
In September 2021, a Turkish official told Adams it was time to repay him for the contributions and benefits by pressuring the fire department to facilitate the opening of the consulate without a fire inspection, in time for a visit by Turkey’s president, according to prosecutors. That request would have been a few months before Adams took office, but after it was clear he would become mayor.
Even after a fire department official warned that major defects at the consulate building had left it “unsafe to occupy,” Adams pushed safety officials to allow it to open. Days later, Adams relayed news of the approval to the Turkish official, who called Adams a “true friend of Turkey,” the indictment states. Adams responded: “You are my brother. I am hear (sic) to help,” according to the indictment.
Several months later, the Turkish official messaged an Adams staffer with another request: that the mayor “not make any statement about the Armenian Genocide” ahead of an April remembrance day, according to the indictment. The staffer confirmed that Adams wouldn’t mention it, which he didn’t. The Turkish government denies that the 1915 killing of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians qualifies as a genocide. 
At times, Adams created and instructed others to create fake paper trails in order to falsely suggest he had paid for travel benefits that were actually free, prosecutors allege. He also deleted messages with others involved in his misconduct, at one point assuring a co-conspirator that he “always” deleted her text messages, according to the indictment.
His lawyer, Alex Spiro, argued that the conduct described in the charges either didn’t involve the mayor or wasn’t illegal, noting that free flights are commonly afforded to politicians. He said Adams had responded to a “courtesy” request from a Turkish official seeking to expedite a fire inspection at a new consulate. “New Yorkers do this all the time,” Spiro added.
The charges were made public hours after FBI agents entered the mayor’s official residence, Gracie Mansion, and seized his phone early Thursday.
The U.S. attorney, Williams, said the corruption investigation would continue. 
Federal prosecutors are believed to be leading multiple, separate inquiries involving Adams and his senior aides, relatives of those aides, campaign fundraising and possible influence peddling of the police and fire departments.
In the last two weeks alone, the police commissioner and schools chancellor have resigned. Neither has been charged with a crime or publicly accused of wrongdoing. In early September, federal investigators seized devices from the police commissioner, schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and other trusted Adams confidants.
This story was updated to correct that prosecutors say Adams’ campaign received more than $10 million, not more than $10,000, in matching public funds.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan erupted with joy Monday as the samurai series “Shogun” won a record 18 Emmys for its first season.
It took home prizes including Outstanding Drama Series, as star and co-producer Hiroyuki Sanada became the first Japanese actor to win the Emmy for best lead actor in a dramatic series. Co-star Anna Sawai won best actress in a dramatic series, also a first for Japan.
“You did it. You did it. Congratulations,” Takashi Yamazaki, director of ” Godzilla Minus One,” wrote on social media. 
People followed the awards live as the wins made national headlines. Entertainment media Oricon proudly reported that a work whose spoken lines were mostly in the Japanese language “made Emmy history.”
“The grand scale of Hollywood combined with the high quality of the production, including costuming, props and mannerisms; the collaboration between the Japanese professional team, headed by producer Sanada, and the local production team; as well as the acting that delivered a strong sense of reality, all came together,” the report said.
Actor Kento Kaku, who starred in the 2024 series “Like a Dragon: Yakuza,” said he was feeling inspired to pursue Hollywood dreams.
“After seeing how cool that was, who’s not going to want to take up the challenge,” he wrote on X.
Actress Tomoko Mariya said she broke into tears the moment Sanada’s win was announced.
“What hardships you must have endured, choosing to leave your entire career behind in Japan and going to America alone. But it has borne fruit,” she wrote, referring to Sanada’s move to Los Angeles 20 years ago. 


The accolades for “Shogun” reflect not only the growing diversity in American entertainment, but also the legacy of Japan’s “jidaigeki” samurai films, which have influenced directors worldwide.
The first Asian actor to win the Emmy for Best Lead Actor in a Dramatic Series was Lee Jung-jae, for the hit 2022 Korean series “Squid Game.”
Sanada is one of a handful of Japanese actors to land major Hollywood roles, including “The Last Samurai,” released in 2003, and “The 47 Ronin,” starring Keanu Reeves in 2013.
The role Sanada plays in “Shogun” was first portrayed by Toshiro Mifune in the 1980s.
Sanada, who also starred in Yoji Yamada ’s 2002 “Twilight Samurai,” alluded to those who went before him in his acceptance speech. 
“I thank all those who supported and kept the legacy of jidaigeki alive,” he said in his speech in Japanese, clutching his trophy. 
“The passion and dreams we inherited traveled across the seas and crossed borders.”

OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Kentucky dragged another highly ranked opponent into the muck, and this time coach Mark Stoops and the Wildcats closed the deal.
Kentucky upset No. 6 Mississippi 20-17 on Saturday, when Rebels kicker Caden Davis hooked a 48-yard field-goal attempt way wide with 48 seconds left in the fourth quarter to give the Wildcats their highest-ranked win of Stoops’ 12-year career.
“It was our kind of game. A dirty, ugly, hard-fought game,” Stoops said. “We went out and did what we had to do. We played our way. I know it’s only one game, but it was a very important game for us. Obviously, I could not be more proud of this team.”
The Rebels (4-1, 0-1 Southeastern Conference) had a seven-game winning streak snapped and were shocked as a 15 1/2-point favorite according to BetMGM Sportsbook in their SEC opener.
“Beyond disappointing. It’s a disappointing day,” Mississippi coach Lane Kiffin said. “The game comes down at the end with us having a chance to win in every phase and we didn’t do it. Got to give credit to Stoops.”
The Wildcats (3-2, 1-2) took a three-point lead with 2:25 left in the fourth quarter, with a little fumble luck. Backup quarterback Gavin Wimsatt was heading toward the goal line with a keeper when an Ole Miss defender knocked the ball free — right to tight end Josh Kattus, who fell into the end zone.
Two weeks after Stoops faced criticism for not being aggressive enough late in the game on fourth down in a 13-12 loss against then-No. 1 Georgia, the Wildcats’ go-ahead drive was kept alive with a 63-yard completion from Brock Vandagriff to Barion Brown on fourth-and-7 at the Kentucky 20.


Vandagriff passed for 243 yards and a touchdown, helping Kentucky play keep-away from the Rebels’ high-powered offense. The Wildcats held the ball for nearly 40 minutes.
Jaxson Dart converted a fourth-and-11 with a 42-yard pass to Caden Prieskorn on the Rebels’ final drive, but two plays later Dart took a sack that sent Ole Miss the wrong way as it tried to get in field-goal range.
Davis’ potential tying kick came on a fourth-and-7.
Dart finished with with 261 yards passing, but after Ole Miss averaged 55 points against overmatched nonconference opponents, the Rebels found the end zone only once after an opening drive touchdown.
Tre Harris led the Rebels with 11 receptions for 176 yards, including a 48-yard touchdown that gave them a 17-13 lead.
Dane Key had eight catches for 105 yards and a touchdown that gave Kentucky a 10-7 halftime lead.
“All I can tell you is Stoops is in the air in the locker room,” Key said. “That’s a pretty good thing.”
Kentucky: The combination of winning the turnover battle (1-0), effectiveness in the red zone (3 for 3) and converting on fourth down (3 for 3) proved to be the difference. The defense has given up only 36 points in the last three games.
Kentucky hadn’t beaten such a highly ranked team on the road since 1977, when the Wildcats won at No. 4 Penn State.
“On the critical downs, we made the critical plays,” Stoops said. “We were not sloppy, we got a turnover and we’ve gotten better every week.”
Mississippi: A season of high expectations, spurred by a star-studded transfer portal class, already has hit a bump. Ole Miss will need a strong October bounceback against a schedule that includes three road games and home dates with No. 21 Oklahoma and No. 2 Georgia.
The Kentucky defense limited Ole Miss to season lows in nearly every statistical categories, allowing 353 total yards. The Wildcats had seven tackles for loss, four sacks and held the Rebels to 1 of 10 on third down.
“Our coaches have preached consistency and we really had a lot of confidence coming into this game,” said Octavious Oxendine, who had two sacks.
How far will the Rebels drop after losing an SEC home opener? The highest-ranked team with one loss is No. 12 Michigan. The AP Top 25 has nine other teams with one loss, so Ole Miss figures to land around there.
Kentucky is idle.
Ole Miss visits South Carolina on Saturday.

Discount retailer Big Lots has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as it contends with a pullback in consumer spending and soft sales.
The Columbus, Ohio-based company plans to sell its assets and ongoing business operations to private equity firm Nexus Capital Management.
Big Lots, which sells furniture, home decor and other items, said in a statement on Monday that high inflation and interest rates have hurt its business as consumers have pulled back on their home and seasonal product purchases, two categories the chain depends on for a significant part of its revenue.
Sales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer’s health, have declined for nine straight quarters, according to FactSet. 
Big Lots said that its performance has been improving, but that its board determined during a strategic review that the proposed sale to Nexus was the right move for the business. The company had postponed the release of its second-quarter results to later this week. 
The company will continue to sell goods at its stores and on its website during the court-supervised sale process. The chain added that it does plan to close some stores, but didn’t specify how many or what locations would be impacted. At the end of 2023, Big Lots operated nearly 1,400 stores in 48 states. 
“The actions we are taking today will enable us to move forward with new owners who believe in our business and provide financial stability, while we optimize our operational footprint, accelerate improvement in our performance, and deliver on our promise to be the leader in extreme value,” Big Lots President and CEO Bruce Thorn said in a statement. 


Nexus Capital will serve as a “stalking horse” bidder in a court-supervised auction, with the proposed sale subject to higher offers or other bids that could be considered better. If Nexus winds up as the winning bidder, the deal is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter. 
Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in an emailed statement that Big Lots seems to have lost some customers at a time when consumers are comparing prices more. 
“Big Lots operates in a very crowded and competitive market where other value players do a far better job of delivering on low prices and compelling bargains. It needs to step up its game if it is to succeed post-bankruptcy,” he said. 
Big Lots Inc. has secured commitments for $707.5 million of financing, including $35 million in new financing from some of its current lenders. Once approved by the court, the financing, along with cash from its ongoing operations, is expected to provide sufficient liquidity to support the company while it works to complete the sale.
The chain has also received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange because the average closing price of its shares was below $1 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. The notice doesn’t mean that Big Lots’ stock will be immediately delisted as the company can appeal. In premarket trading shares slid 40% to 30 cents.",False

Publication date:2024-09-22 07:00:00

SINGAPORE (AP) — Lando Norris survived a couple of brushes with barriers as he won the Singapore Grand Prix with ease and cut into Max Verstappen’s Formula 1 standings lead Sunday.
Norris started on pole position ahead of Verstappen and steadily built a large lead for his third career win. All have come this year.
From now on, though, the title is no longer entirely in Norris’ hands. Even if he wins every remaining race, second place in each would be enough for Verstappen to retain the title.
Norris started on pole position for the sixth time in his career and, for a driver with a tendency to lose places off the grid this season, had an unusually drama-free start. It was the first time Norris has won from pole without losing a place on the first lap.
There were two brief moments of jeopardy when the McLaren driver first locked his brakes and touched the barriers, prompting concern he’d damaged the front wing, and later when a rear tire brushed another but Norris seemed largely unaffected as he cruised to the win.
“It was an amazing race. A few too many close calls,” Norris said. “It’s not that you’re necessarily over-pushing. Sometimes it can be that you’re just chilling too much. Maybe it’s a bit of both. I don’t know what it is, but it’s tricky.”
With such a big lead, staying focused was one of Norris’ challenges. Races in Singapore have a habit of turning on strategy calls, or if a crash brings out the safety car and brings the cars back together. Norris had to stay alert but there was no safety car — a first in Singapore.


Verstappen came in second for Red Bull after a race that was largely uneventful after he held off Lewis Hamilton into the first corner at the start.
Oscar Piastri, the winner for McLaren in Azerbaijan last week, moved up from fifth on the grid to finish third after passing Mercedes’ Hamilton and later George Russell for the final podium place.
Verstappen seemed relaxed Sunday, holding onto second and minimizing the damage to his lead, which was trimmed from 59 to 52 points.
“I think on a weekend where we knew that we were going to struggle, to be P2 is a good achievement. Of course we’re not happy with second,” Verstappen said. “Now we just have to try and improve more and more and that’s what we’ll try to do.”
Six rounds of the championship remain, starting with the United States Grand Prix next month, and three of those offer extra points with sprint races.
If Norris earns maximum points in every one of those nine events, including the bonus point for fastest lap, and Verstappen finishes second in each, then Norris would cut the gap by only 51 points — finishing one behind Verstappen, who hasn’t won since June.
That state of play is partly thanks to Daniel Ricciardo, whose place in F1 with Red Bull’s second team RB could be under threat. The Australian made a small but potentially vital intervention in the championship fight Sunday.
Ricciardo stopped for fresh tires late on and set the fastest lap of the race on his way to finishing 18th. That deprived Norris of the extra point for fastest lap that he seemed set to secure.
“Thank you, Daniel,” Verstappen said over the radio.
Russell was fourth, ahead of Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, while seven-time champion Hamilton had to settle for sixth after Mercedes’ strategy left him on older tires than his rivals at the end of the race.
Carlos Sainz Jr. was seventh for Ferrari after crashing in qualifying, with Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin eighth and Haas’ Nico Hulkenberg ninth.
Tenth place was all Sergio Perez could manage in a season where he has frequently struggled to match the pace of his Red Bull teammate Verstappen.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Trea Turner shouted for his booze-soaked Phillies teammates to clear a path — the clouds of smoke formed from puffs of his celebratory cigar certainly opened a hole — as he rode into the clubhouse on a platform truck also stacked with cases of beer.
Hoodie up, googles on, Turner jumped and splashed into the swill of beer and bubbly that sopped the clubhouse floor, the All-Star shortstop ready to crash the bash that had circled him.
The Phillies are used to the party, though this one came with a twist — for the first time in 13 years, they are headed to the postseason as NL East champs.
Kyle Schwarber and J.T. Realmuto went deep. Phillies fans went wild. And pitcher Aaron Nola provided a taste of just how great it would feel for the entire franchise if Philly went all the way.
The Phillies won the NL East for the first time since 2011, clinching the division title with a 6-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Monday night.
“That was our main goal in spring training, to win the division and get that first-round bye,” slugger Bryce Harper said. “Do all the things we can to kind of set us up for the postseason. The division was the first thing.”
The Phillies had rolled tarp pinned above clubhouse locker stalls before the game, a familiar protective sight for the bottle-popping ahead for a team that’s made the playoffs each of the past three seasons under manager Rob Thomson.


They went wild moments after Carlos Estévez retired Michael Busch on a flyball to end the game. Phillies players swarmed each other in excitement on the infield. The Phillie Phanatic stormed the celebration waving a 2024 flag as fans stood and filmed it all.
“We know there’s a really big picture ahead of us,” Schwarber said before the game. “Winning the division is a big thing. If we go out there and do our thing tonight, it’s going to be well deserved. It’s not an easy division to win. It’s never been an easy division to win. It definitely will be a cool thing.”
Oh, it was cool in Philly for an announced sellout crowd of 42,386, with temperatures in the 60s — a sneak peek of October weather.
That suits this squad just fine.
With a postseason berth already clinched last week, Schwarber, Harper, Turner & Co. earned the franchise’s 12th division championship — and have their sights set on the top seed in the National League playoffs. 
The Phillies (93-64) hold the No. 2 spot just behind the Los Angeles Dodgers (93-63) and would earn a first-round bye should the standings hold.
“The biggest things for me, really, are winning the division and getting the bye,” Thomson said. “If we get home field throughout, that’s a bonus. But I won’t put our players in danger to get there.”
The Phillies have two games left against the Cubs and close the season with a three-game set in Washington.
With playoff appearances now the norm for these Phillies, perhaps the inevitability of it all kept some fans home. After selling out game after game during a sensational season, there were pockets of empty seats at Citizens Bank Park, which topped 3.2 million in attendance.
Thomson once said a rival coach told him a playoff game in Philly was “four hours of hell.”
“I feel like it’s the best atmosphere in sports,” All-Star reliever Jeff Hoffman said. “It feels like it’s 50,000 vs. nine. It’s always a good feeling when you step on the field.”
Phillies fans were greeted by “CLINCHED” on the videoboard outside Citizens Bank Park, while the main entrance featured Harper and Nola as the anchor photos on a “Make More HISTORY” banner.
“Being able to come home and do it here, in front of the best fans of baseball, in front of a fanbase that showed out for us each night, it was just a lot of fun,” Harper said.
Philadelphia ended Atlanta’s run of six consecutive NL East titles and is trying to finish with the major leagues’ best record and home-field advantage throughout the postseason.
Seeking their third World Series championship following titles in 1980 and 2008, the Phillies overtook Atlanta for the division lead on May 3 and haven’t trailed since.
Philadelphia won five straight NL East titles from 2007-11, then went 10 years without making the playoffs. A wild-card entry each of the past two postseasons, the Phillies put together consecutive October runs that ended in heartbreak. 
They reached the 2022 World Series, losing to Houston in six games, and dropped a seven-game NL Championship Series to Arizona last year after leading the underdog Diamondbacks 2-0 and 3-2.
The path to this division title was a bit messy after the team raced to the best 50-game start in the majors since Seattle in 2001. The Phillies slumped in the summer, and returned home this week from a 2-5 trip against Milwaukee and the New York Mets.
Both are teams the Phillies could face in October.
It seemed fitting the 31-year-old Nola was on the mound for the clincher. Nola was a first-round draft pick by the Phillies in 2014, debuted the next year and has been with them his entire career. He’s been one of baseball’s most dependable pitchers — a valuable commodity with the modern stress on big league bullpens.
Nola helped Philadelphia secure a wild card last year, then went 3-1 with a 2.35 ERA in four playoff starts. He made five postseason starts in 2022, going 2-2 with a 4.91 ERA.
Nola only briefly tested the free-agent market last offseason before signing a $172 million, seven-year deal to stick with the Phillies.
His reward — another postseason opportunity to bring home a World Series title now 16 years in the making.
“I think that says a lot about our club. We stayed hungry after the losses in the World Series and the CS last year,” Nola said. “We hope we can keep that going.”

BERLIN (AP) — Ethiopians Milkesa Mengesha and Tigist Ketema won the men’s and women’s races in the 50th edition of the Berlin Marathon on Sunday.
The 24-year-old Mengesha finished strongly and ran a personal best time of 2 hours, 3 minutes and 17 seconds to finish ahead of Kenyans Cybrian Kotut and Stephen Kiprop in the men’s race. Haymanot Alew of Ethiopia was fourth.
Mengesha collapsed after crossing the finish line and wiped away tears as he was overcome by emotion.
The women’s result was clear long before the men’s as Ketema dropped her rivals before the half-way mark and finished in 2:16:42 – the third fastest time recorded in Berlin. Compatriots Mestawot Fikir and Bosena Mulatie followed in 2:18:48 and 2:19:00, respectively.
Conditions were perfect on a sunny crisp autumn day in the German capital.
A record number of 58,212 runners from 161 nations registered to run on the course where more world records (13) were set than any other. Another record was not expected this soon after the top stars raced at the Olympics last month.
It was the first Berlin Marathon without either Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge or Ethiopia’s Kenenisa Bekele since 2014.
Kipchoge still holds the Berlin course record of 2:01:09 from 2022 – then a world record that was only beaten by Kelvin Kiptum with a time of 2:00:35 in the Chicago Marathon in October last year. The 24-year-old Kiptum was killed in a car crash in his native Kenya in February.
Ethiopia’s Tigst Assefa set the women’s world record of 2:11:53 in the Berlin Marathon last year.

Publication date:2024-09-22 07:00:00

A’ja Wilson and Caitlin Clark had record-breaking seasons, putting up stats the WNBA had never seen before.
Wilson became the first player in league history to score more than 1,000 points in a season, and she averaged a record 26.9 points. Clark broke the league’s single-season assist mark and scored the most points ever for a rookie.
So it’s no surprise the two were honored Sunday as the unanimous choices for the AP Player and Rookie of the Year awards, respectively, by a 15-member media panel.
“It means a lot,” Wilson said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. “The preparation you put in, the approach I set myself up for this season.”
The Las Vegas Aces star was named the league’s MVP earlier Sunday, also unanimously. The WNBA will announce the rest of its awards over the course of the postseason, which begins Sunday.
Wilson finished the regular season with 1,021 points and 451 rebounds and led the league with 98 blocks. She finished third in the WNBA MVP voting last season, receiving one fourth-place vote that she said fueled her in the offseason to get better.
“It propelled me a little bit as I started my offseason workouts, but around February I was over it,” Wilson said. “I didn’t want to give that person that energy, that’s when I started to lock in.”
Clark came into the league with quite possibly more hype than any rookie ever and she delivered, leading the Indiana Fever to the playoffs for the first time since 2016. She broke the WNBA single-season record with 337 assists, including a league-record 19 in one game. She also broke the single-season rookie scoring mark as she averaged 19.2 points.


“This is a tremendous honor to be named The Associated Press Rookie of the Year,” she said. “This recognition wouldn’t be possible without an incredible group of teammates and coaches, and we are looking forward to continuing an exciting regular season in the postseason.”
Off the court she helped lift the WNBA to record ratings and attendance.
Clark headlined the all-rookie team along with Angel Reese of the Chicago Sky, who broke the rebounds-per-game record by averaging 13.1. She would have had the overall rebounding record as well had she not gotten hurt at the end of the season. Other rookies on the team were New York’s Leonie Fiebich, Los Angeles’ Rickea Jackson and Chicago’s Kamilla Cardoso.
Wilson’s teammate Tiffany Hayes earned AP Sixth Woman of the Year honors.
“She’s our difference-maker in a lot of ways, what she brings on the court and in the locker room,” Wilson said. “Tiff doesn’t have to be the vocal leader, but everyone listens when she speaks — shows the great player she is.”
Wilson and Clark headlined the AP All-WNBA first team. They were joined by Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart and Alyssa Thomas. Sabrina Ionescu, Kahleah Copper, Nneka Ogwumike, Kayla McBride and Arike Ogunbowale were on the second team.
Other AP winners included:
—Coach of the Year: Cheryl Reeve. She helped Minnesota finish second in the regular season with a team that was picked ninth in the preseason. The Lynx won the Commissioner’s Cup and finished the regular season with 13 wins in their final 15 games.
—Comeback Player of the Year: Skylar Diggins-Smith. The Seattle Storm guard missed last season after giving birth to her second child. Diggins-Smith averaged 15.1 points and 6.4 assists this season.
—Most Improved Player: Dearica Hamby. The Los Angeles Sparks forward made a huge jump this season by averaging 17.3 points — 8.4 more than last season. She also improved her rebounding by more than three a game. Hamby edged Connecticut’s DiJonai Carrington by one vote.
—Defensive Player: Collier. The Lynx star had an incredible season on both ends of the court, but she was an anchor especially for Minnesota’s stellar defense. The team had the best defense in the WNBA this season and Collier’s play was the main reason why. Wilson finished second, three votes behind Collier.
“I’m so proud of Phee’s defensive work in 2024. Her commitment to all aspects of our defense — deflections, denials, steals, blocks, rebounds — anchored one of the top defensive teams in the league and led to her best season yet as a pro,” Reeve said.
Minnesota finished atop the power poll, with New York second. Las Vegas and Connecticut were the next two teams. They were followed by Seattle, Indiana, Atlanta and Phoenix. Washington, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles finished off the poll.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Many Mexicans will feel a deep sense of loss when folksy, charismatic, nationalistic President Andrés Manuel López Obrador leaves office on Sept. 30 — and that’s no surprise.

López Obrador himself has spent an inordinate amount of time talking about his own legacy — and his place in history — over his six-year term, something he brings up at almost every one of his marathonic daily 7 a.m. media briefings.

But what legacy will the rumpled, grinning López Obrador leave? It is perhaps the main question for a man who is obsessed with history, and one thing appears clear: He has changed the way politics is done in Mexico, perhaps forever.

Unlike decades of reserved and distant presidents, López Obrador has built a deep personal connection with many Mexicans. He has stripped the office of the thousands of presidential guards, limousines and walled compounds that once characterized it, saying “you can’t have a rich government with poor people.”

“He is a politician who evokes familiarity, he reminds people of a father, an uncle, a grandfather,” said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico’s Center for Economic Research and Teaching. That’s not a coincidence, either. López Obrador constantly praises the traditional family and says it has saved the country.

“He does feel nostalgia for some of the social structures of the 1970s in Mexico and nostalgia for the family,” said Pérez Ricart.

Will his legacy be like that of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose New Deal created lasting institutions like Social Security and home mortgage programs that resulted in an enormous, stable middle class?

The Mexican leader stakes his movement on cash social-benefit programs, he likes to compare himself to Roosevelt and many Mexicans think of him with the same fondness that the more patrician FDR inspired in his day.

“I think he’s going to be remembered as a president who started big changes, who thought about the people,” said Armando López, 60, who works as a street cleaner.

Marina Fiesco, an office worker taking a break at a Mexico City park with her 11-year-old son, voiced similar feelings.

“I feel he does think about the people,” said Fiesco. “It’s not about left or right, a president has to look out for the people.”

Part of that connection is that he talks more, and fields more questions, than probably any other leader in the world.

In his six years in office, he has held about 1,400 televised morning briefings that last an average of 2 1/2 hours each. He tells jokes, talks about his favorite foods, lashes out at critical journalists, makes fun of the opposition and sometimes plays his favorite music videos. Most briefings end with him saying, “Let’s go get breakfast.”

He frequently says things that are not true. He claims Mexico doesn’t produce fentanyl — the deadly synthetic opioid that kills about 70,000 Americans every year — even though his own officials have contradicted him. When homicides spiked this year — despite his claims to have achieved an 18% reduction — he simply ignored the figures.

Many Mexicans seem willing to tolerate the untruths, in part because López Obrador, 70, has mastered a key Mexican folk saying: “He who gets angry, loses.” He brushes real contradictions and problems off with a chuckle, a stony refusal to discuss them, or his stock phrase, “I have other data.”

He’s probably the most skillful politician ever to rule Mexico and seems to enjoy some unstoppable motivating force: In all of his thousands of hours of talking, never once has he sat down, taken one sip of water or gone off to use the bathroom.

Influenced by Mexican presidents of the 20th century, López Obrador would have liked to make his mark with big infrastructure projects — he is obsessed with railroads and oil refineries — and big state-owned companies like the ones that dominated Mexico’s economy in the 1970s, his formative years.

But his building projects have been often ill-planned and will be subject to the withering trends of economic and energy transition. Unlike his heroes from the past, he hasn’t been able to nationalize any industry, and has only been able to fight a rear-guard action to defend the indebted, struggling state-owned oil and electric power companies he inherited.

Nor has he been able to make much of a mark in foreign policy, apart from a few rather pointless, unresolved disputes with Spain, the Vatican, Ecuador and Peru. In the face of U.S. pressure, he has used the 120,000-member national guard he created not to confront drug cartels, but to prevent migrants from reaching the U.S. border.

And his social programs — like the $150-per month payment to people over 65 — can fade, be defunded or eviscerated by inflation.

So could López Obrador turn out to be a figure like Argentina’s president in the 1940s and 50s, Juan Perón, who left behind an ideologically amorphous legacy that was fought over by disparate wings of his movement for decades?

“I think that what we are going to see is the ‘balkanization’ of Obrador-ism,” said Pérez Ricart, “a dispute between the left and the right to own the term, a bit like what happened with Peronism in Argentina.”

Or he could go down in history as the person who, however briefly, revived the nearly century-old Mexican tradition of a “state party,” like the old PRI, where López Obrador began his political career. The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years, before corruption, internal disputes and economic crises brought it down.

Some of López Obrador’s most devoted followers seem surprisingly willing to take the chance of another PRI.

“If after 70 years we’ve found we made a mistake, well, that’s life,” Fiesco said.

López Obrador may be part of a regionwide revival of old, populistic state-party models, both on the left and right.

For example, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele stresses that his administration — which won even greater margins of reelection than López Obrador’s Morena — is a “hegemonic party, not a state party.”

That’s almost exactly how Morena supporters describe their movement, but the instant any party starts to use the power of the government to keep itself in power, that distinction disappears.

Most people think it’s unlikely that Morena will last as long in power as the seven-decade run of the PRI.

“Times have changed, that’s not possible anymore,” said Armando López, the street cleaner. “People will support him as long as they see something (in return). They’re not going to follow him blindly.”

The Morena party was cobbled together by López Obrador out of old PRI members like himself and people from more leftist backgrounds. López Obrador is Morena’s star, its guide, its moral authority. Once he’s gone, the tensions within the party — already palpable — will likely grow stronger.

López Obrador is very aware of that, and from the start he has consciously built structures to guard his legacy, which he views as his own, not the party’s. He has handed more economic and law-enforcement power over to the armed forces than any other Mexican president, because the army obeys him unquestioningly and he trusts them.

His longest-lasting legacy may be those structural changes: the militarization of law enforcement and large swaths of the economy, the elimination of all independent regulatory and oversight agencies, the frequent attacks on the media and a judicial overhaul that critics say will weaken democratic checks and balances.

Mexico’s armed forces now run airports, trains, customs facilities — and even an airline.

“The truth is that there is one really important legacy, and that is the legacy of militarization,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor at George Mason University.

BERLIN (AP) — Honors even after Bayern Munich dominated defending champion Bayer Leverkusen in a 1-1 draw in the Bundesliga on Saturday.
The Bavarian powerhouse’s inability to find a winning goal ended its six-game winning start to the season across all competitions.
But Vincent Kompany’s team will take more from the draw than counterpart Xabi Alonso’s Leverkusen, which has lost its aura of superiority since completing last season unbeaten to end Bayern’s 11-year reign as champion.
“It was only a draw, but the manner of it was very impressive,” Bayern director of sport Max Eberl said.
Leverkusen won their last meeting 3-0 in February, while the sides drew 2-2 in Alonso’s first visit to Munich as Leverkusen coach.
“The goal was to stay compact and allow little,” Leverkusen midfielder Granit Xhaka said, referring to Bayern’s big-scoring wins to start the season. “You can do more with the ball and everyone knows that we can do more.”
Bayern dominated the opening half-hour, but Robert Andrich scored. The combative Leverkusen midfielder volleyed Xhaka’s cut back from a corner to send the ball inside the left post.
It was the first time Bayern fell behind in a game since Kompany took over as coach.
Andrich was booked the next minute for a tackle on Harry Kane, who would go on to finish the game with no shots at goal – an anomaly.
Aleksandar Pavlović deservedly equalized in the 39th with a brilliant strike from outside the penalty area.


Also in the first half, Bayern supporters in the south end of the stadium held banners criticizing their club for the players’ grey jerseys instead of the usual red and white. They accused club management of simulating local pride.
After the break, Serge Gnabry hit the post, then the crossbar in the closest Bayern went to scoring again.
Elias Saad scored twice and set up another goal as Hamburg-based cult club St. Pauli claimed its first Bundesliga win for 13 years by 3-0 in Freiburg on Saturday.
Saad opened the scoring early, set up the next goal, then sealed the win when he surged past four Freiburg players on a counterattack in the 73rd minute, shortly after the home side had a goal ruled out through VAR for offside.
St. Pauli secured promotion as the second-division champion last season, returning to the top division for the first time since its relegation in 2011. It’s still known for its supporters’ left-wing stance and the pirate skull-and-crossbones emblem that was popularized by fans who identified as punks.
Germany forward Deniz Undav scored deep in stoppage time to salvage a 2-2 draw for 10-man Stuttgart at Wolfsburg.
Tomas Cvancara scored just as late to give Borussia Mönchengladbach a 1-0 win over Union Berlin, dealing the visitor its first defeat of the season.
Heidenheim enjoyed a 2-0 win in Mainz, where both teams finished with 10 men, and Leipzig coasted to a 4-0 win over visiting Augsburg.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate has confirmed a new commander of U.S. Army forces in the Pacific after Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville dropped his objections and allowed a quick vote on the nomination.
Tuberville had blocked Lt. Gen. Ronald Clark’s nomination for months over concerns that the top military aide to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, along with other staff, did not immediately notify President Joe Biden when Austin was hospitalized with complications from cancer treatment earlier this year.
Clark, who Biden had nominated in July, was confirmed late Tuesday evening. Tuberville said Wednesday that he dropped his hold after meeting with Clark and talking to others in the Pentagon. 
Tuberville had initially demanded to see a report from the Pentagon’s inspector general that will review the matter, but that report hasn’t yet been released and Congress is leaving Washington until after the November election.
“I didn’t want to leave him hanging, so I asked him to come over and we sat down and talked for about an hour,” Tuberville said. Clark’s explanation matched that of others he had spoken to, “so I trusted him and what he was telling me,” Tuberville said. 
There was bipartisan frustration with Austin and his top aides earlier this year after it became clear that Biden was kept in the dark about the defense secretary not being in command for days during his January hospital visit. Lawmakers argued that could have meant confusion or delays in military action.


Austin was admitted to intensive care for complications from prostate cancer surgery on Jan. 1, but the White House was not told until three days later. Austin’s senior staff were notified on Jan. 2.
Tuberville said he’s still concerned about the situation and how it unfolded, but after speaking with Clark, he believes he wasn’t one of the main people responsible for the lapse.
“We do have problems there, but it wasn’t his problem,” Tuberville said.
Austin said at the time that he took full responsibility and had apologized to Biden. He insisted that there were no gaps in control of the department or the nation’s security because “at all times, either I or the deputy secretary was in a position to conduct the duties of my office.” 
An earlier Pentagon review of the matter blamed privacy restrictions and staff hesitancy for the secrecy, and called for improved procedures, which have been made. 
A hold by any senator on a nomination, or on a piece of legislation, blocks a quick vote by unanimous consent. Democrats could have brought the nomination up for a vote, circumventing the hold, but it would have taken several days of floor time to do so. A vote would not have been scheduled until after the November election. 
The objections over Clark came a year after Tuberville’s blockade of hundreds of military promotions over a Pentagon abortion policy. The Alabama senator held up the nominations for months but relented after he faced intense criticism from senators in both parties. The Senate finally approved 425 military promotions and nominations in November.
Republican colleagues said they agreed with Tuberville on the abortion policy but openly pressured him to drop the holds, voicing concern about military readiness and the toll it was taking on service members and their families who had nothing to do with the regulations.",False

SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) — Future opponents of Syracuse football might want to take seriously a message delivered from first-year coach Fran Brown.
Don’t give him any bulletin board material because it may bite you.
Kyle McCord passed for 381 yards and four touchdowns, two each to Trebor Pena and Oronde Gadsden II, and Syracuse held on to knock off newly ranked No. 23 Georgia Tech on Saturday.
Earlier in the week, Georgia Tech coach Brent Key said his team’s matchup against the Orange “wasn’t about Xs and Os” but rather being physical against Syracuse. Brown took that as a swipe at his program being soft. 
“I took it personal when he said it wasn’t about Xs and Os,” Brown said. “It was about coming up here and being physical and tough for four hours. We’re from the Northeast. What you mean by that? Like we’re not physical and tough? ... Syracuse has been physical forever. I want to make sure that will never be said about us. We’re not soft. That bothered me. 
 “I’ve coached with (Georgia coach) Kirby Smart and (former Georgia co-defensive coordinator) Will Muschamp. That’s what they do. Why would we not be a tough physical football team?,” Brown added. “I want to make sure everyone understands that. When you play us, just be quiet. Don’t give no ammo to me. You give ammo to me, I’m coming at you full tilt.”
The Yellow Jackets (2-1, 1-1 ACC), ranked in the AP Top 25 last week for the first time since 2015, cut the lead to three with 2:31 to go on a 15-yard scoring run by Jamal Haynes.


The Orange made sure Georgia Tech never got the ball back, running out the clock for their first win against a ranked opponent since October 2022 against North Carolina State.
“We knew they were a physical team and (thought) we could control that. At times today it showed that we were really not, and that came down to physicality,” Key said.
McCord was 32-of-46 passing, with career highs in attempts and completions. Gadsden had six catches for 93 yards. Pena has five touchdowns on the young season. 
Syracuse (2-0, 1-0 ACC) accumulated 515 yards in total offense.
Not known for his running ability, McCord scrambled for 16 yards on a third-and-3, the longest run of his career, and his emotions took over after that play.
“That was a big point of the game. The spike? I probably need to reel the emotions in a bit,” he said.
Haynes King was 28-of-38 for 259 yards for Georgia Tech. He passed for one score and ran for two. 
King escaped the grasp of linebacker Derek McDonald and scrambled 21 yards for his first score. He faked a pitch and scored from 26 yards out to get Georgia Tech to 21-14 with 4:39 to go in the first half.
The Orange defense held Haynes, the Yellow Jackets’ leading rusher, to just 35 yards on 11 carries. He had averaged 5.7 yards a carry entering the game.
“He (Brown) just kept playing that clip (Key clip) over and over and over and over at practice, throughout the week,” Syracuse edge rusher Fadil Diggs said. “He just wanted to get it through our head and it looked like we were the more physical team.”
Georgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets need to have their running game rolling to give the dual-threat King more help. The Orange clamped down on that.
Syracuse: Brown said his team needed to get more physical after their season-opening win against Ohio. His players must have heard him, holding the Yellow Jackets to 112 yards rushing.
Georgia Tech will likely fall from the rankings. 
Syracuse has some work to do on its special teams. Georgia Tech blocked a field goal, a punt and recovered an onside kick.
The jersey of former Syracuse defensive end Dwight Freeney, recently inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, was lifted to the rafters during halftime ceremonies. 
Georgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets return home to face VMI next Saturday.
Syracuse: The Orange have a week off before another early-season conference game Sept. 20 against Stanford.

PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) — Rutgers has hired a law firm to conduct an investigation into athlete allegations of bullying, favoritism and revenge by the coach of the gymnastics program.
President Jonathan Holloway announced earlier this week the university hired Lowenstein Sandler partner Matthew Boxer to lead the investigation into allegations against coach Umme Salim-Beasley.
The allegations coincided with the surprising retirement of Scarlet Knights Athletic Director Pat Hobbs on Aug. 16. He cited health issues in stepping down.
A former New Jersey state comptroller and federal prosecutor, Boxer investigated the Rutgers’ softball program in 2020 after members of the team said coaches subjected athletes to emotional abuse and abusive conditioning.
NJ Advance Media first reported the gymnastics allegations, talking with seven former gymnasts and one still on the team who described a “toxic” climate in the program while detailing their experiences with Salim-Beasley.
“This effort will ensure that any and all concerns raised about the program have been thoroughly reviewed, determine whether appropriate follow-up steps were taken, identify reasons for any potentially insufficient responses, and recommend areas where additional steps may be necessary,” Holloway said in a statement. “The review will further identify and address any concerns about the culture of the team that are revealed.”
Holloway said the recommendations in the report will be made public. He said the firm will be paid a $50,000 retainer and a rate of $225,000 for the first month, dropping to $195,000 for the second month. Fees will be revisited if additional time is needed to complete the review.


Holloway told the the university governing boards on Aug. 31 about ordering the external investigation. At the time he wrote that he was confident that the university had applied its policies appropriately as it pertains to the gymnastics program.
“Our learning environment depends upon the safety, health, and mental well-being of all our students, and the university strives in every aspect of our operations to foster an environment where our students can thrive,” Holloway wrote. “Rutgers Athletics shares this commitment. Whenever concerns or allegations arise about our support for students, the University investigates those concerns in accordance with our policies, the law, and, in the case of Athletics, our NCAA standards.”

Hurricane Helene killed and destroyed far and wide — from Tampa to Atlanta to Asheville, North Carolina, its high winds, heavy rains and sheer size created a perfect mix for devastation.

The storm made landfall late Thursday along a largely undeveloped expanse of pine trees and salt marshes on Florida’s Big Bend coast, but it immediately displayed its far-reaching power several hundred miles away. As of Sunday morning, at least 64 people were confirmed killed.

Tampa Bay was inundated with a massive storm surge that sent water up to people’s attics. Atlanta got more than 11 inches of rain, more than any 48-hour period in recorded history. So many trees were toppled in South Carolina that at one point more than 40 percent of the state lost electricity. In North Carolina, dams were in jeopardy of failing and entire communities are cut off by floods. Floodwaters submerged a hospital in Tennessee so quickly that more than 50 patients had to be rescued from the roof via helicopter.

How did a single storm unleash destruction so far away?

Dan Brown, a specialist at the National Hurricane Center near Miami, said Helene had all the attributes that make a storm widely destructive. 

It was large, about 350 miles (560 kilometers) wide. It was strong, with winds reaching 140 mph (225 kph) when it made landfall late Thursday, creating widespread storm surge. It carried heavy rains. And it was fast, speeding north at up to 24 mph (39 kph) offshore and 30 mph (48 kph) inland. 



He compared the geographic scale of Helene’s destruction to 1972’s Hurricane Agnes, 1989’s Hurricane Hugo and 2004’s Hurricane Ivan. 

“Systems that get very powerful, large and fast moving unfortunately do bring the potential for impact and damage well inland,” Brown said Saturday. 

Here is a look at the many deadly tentacles of Helene.

Helene’s devastation began Thursday, hours before it made landfall, as it swept through the Gulf of Mexico. Its then-120-mph (193-kph) winds created storm surge that pushed 6-to-15-feet (2-to-4.5 meters) of water into island and coastal neighborhoods all along Florida’s west coast. 

Nine people who drowned were residents who stayed behind after their Tampa Bay area neighborhoods were ordered evacuated. 

Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri expressed his frustration — issuing evacuation orders isn’t a decision that’s made lightly, he said. Many who ignored officials then called for help as some sought refuge in their attics from the rising waters. Deputies tried to help, using boats and high-profile vehicles, but they couldn’t reach many neighborhoods.

“We made our case, we told people what they needed to do and they chose otherwise,” Gualtieri said at a Friday press conference. 

Late Thursday, Helene’s eye slammed into the northwest Florida coast in the Big Bend area, the spot where the Panhandle makes its westward jut from the peninsula — Hurricanes Idalia and Debby had previously hit the area within the last 13 months. 

Susan Sauls Hartway had evacuated her seaside home — it was gone and when she returned Friday. 

“I knew it would be bad, but I had no idea it was going to be this bad,” Hartway said. “This is unbelievable.”

After making landfall, Helene sped into Georgia. Among more than 20 dead were a 27-year-old mother and her 1-month old twins died Friday when trees fell on their house in Thomson, just west of Augusta. An 89-year-old woman was killed when trees fell on her house nearby. 

Rhonda Bell and her husband were spending a sleepless night in the downstairs bedroom of their century-old home just outside Valdosta, where Helene’s center passed shortly after midnight.

The winds broke off limbs, tore away neighbors’ roof shingles and knocked down fence panels in the neighborhood with train tracks along one edge. Then a towering oak tree crashed through the roof of an upstairs bedroom. 

“I just felt the whole house shake,” Bell said. “Thank God we’re both alive to tell about it.”

Atlanta was hit with 11 inches (28 centimeters) of rain, the heaviest 48-hour downfall since the city began keeping records in 1878. Streets flooded, submerging cars. Firefighters rescued at least 20 people.





Helene’s heavy rains in the state’s western mountains caused massive flooding and mudslides in the Asheville region, cutting off most communication and making the roads impassable. 

Video posted online shows large portions of the city underwater. 

More than 1,000 miles (1,610 kilometers) away in Texas, Jessica Drye Turner begged on Facebook on Friday for someone to rescue her family members stranded on their Asheville rooftop. 

But in a follow-up message Saturday, Turner said the roof had collapsed before help arrived and her parents, both in their 70s, and her 6-year-old nephew had drowned. 

“I cannot convey in words the sorrow, heartbreak and devastation my sisters and I are going through,” she wrote.

Jeff Muenstermann and his wife, Lisa, friends of Turner’s, told The Associated Press on Saturday they had spoken to Turner after she posted the initial plea for help. At her request, they messaged members of The Village Church in Flower Mound, Texas, where they all attend, to pray for the family’s safety back in North Carolina.

“I just thought they were going to be rescued,” Jeff Muenstermann said. “I asked everybody to pray and they did. And then a couple hours later, her husband called me, completely distraught and said ... we lost them. They all drowned.”



The storm was especially deadly in South Carolina. The biggest impact appears to be falling trees. The storm also produced tornadoes in the state.

In Saluda County, two firefighters were killed when a tree fell on their truck while they were answering a call. In Greenville County, four people were killed by falling trees. Four people were also killed in Aiken County by trees falling on homes, including a 78-year-old husband and his 74-year-old wife. 



Helene’s heavy rains caused the state’s eastern rivers to overflow their banks and threatened to break dams, endangering those living nearby and forcing them to flee. 

Patients and others at a hospital near the North Carolina border had to be evacuated to the roof Friday when torrents from the overflowing Nolichucky River rushed into the building. 

Unicoi County Hospital tried to evacuate 11 patients and dozens of others, but the water was too treacherous for boats sent by the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency to navigate. 

Helicopters were flown in to help rescue them. Eventually, everyone was evacuated.",False

FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris looked for a boost with persuadable and less-motivated voters as she participated in a livestream Thursday evening with former talk show host Oprah Winfrey to focus on her plans to cut costs for the middle class, restore a national right to abortion and address gun violence.
The event, billed as “Unite for America,” and hosted by Winfrey from suburban Michigan, one of this election’s key battlegrounds, sought to tap into the same energy as long-running Winfrey’s talk show, which drove bestseller lists and allowed celebrities to share their softer side and everyday people to share stories of struggle and inspiration.
It leaned on celebrities like Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Lopez and Meryl Streep, but also the stories of ordinary voters to promote Harris’ message over the course of 90 minutes and to draw a contrast with former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee. More than 300,000 people were watching the Harris campaign livestream on YouTube alone and the event was also being streamed on other major social media platforms.
“We each have those moments in our lives when it’s time to step up,” Harris said when Winfrey asked about her overnight transformation as she went from President Joe Biden’s running mate to being the Democratic nominee in her own right after he suddenly dropped out in July. “I felt a sense of responsibility, to be honest with you, and with that comes a sense of purpose.”
Winfrey told Harris it looked as if a “veil dropped” and she “stepped into your power.”


At one point Harris reminded viewers that she owns a gun — which surprised Winfrey — saying, “If somebody’s breaking into my house they’re gettin’ shot.” She added, “I probably shouldn’t have said that.”
Harris was given the chance to talk about her plans to reduce the cost of housing and lower taxes for the middle class, as she took questions from voters in Michigan and Virginia.
Oprah recognized Hadley Duvall in the audience, a 22-year-old woman who became an abortion rights advocate after she was raped by her stepfather as a child.
“You can’t wait until it’s too late to care about reproductive healthcare, because then it’s too late,” said Duvall, who is featured in a new Harris campaign ad. “Thank you for hearing us and seeing us when the Supreme Court won’t,” Duvall added in praise of Harris.
Harris and Winfrey also welcomed the mother and sister of a young Georgia mother who died after waiting 20 hours for a hospital to treat her complications from an abortion pill. Amber Thurman’s death, first reported Monday by ProPublica, occurred just two weeks after Georgia’s strict abortion ban was enacted in 2022 following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn nationwide abortion rights. Harris has blamed her death on Trump.
“Amber was not a statistic, she was loved by a family, a strong family and we would have done whatever to get my baby, our baby, the help that she needed,” said Thurman’s mother, Shanette Williams.
Harris praised their courage in speaking out and called out a “healthcare crisis” caused by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. “They have no right to be in your womb,” added Winfrey.
Natalie Griffith, a student who was shot twice last month at Apalachee High School in Georgia, joined with her parents. Her mother described the fear she felt after learning about the gunfire at her child’s school.
What to know about the 2024 Election
“No parent should go through this,” Marilda Griffith said through tears, describing rushing out of work, then running to the school to learn if her daughter was OK. She appealed for federal action to curb gun violence.
Harris, after pointing out that she herself owns a gun, said assault-style rifles were designed to kill as many people as possible on a battlefield, and “don’t belong on the streets of a civil society.”
The event comes as Harris is working to continue to share her biography and governing philosophy with voters during her abbreviated presidential campaign, with early voting already underway in some states.
Harris has limited her interactions with the traditional media, instead prioritizing digital engagement and casual — and often more controlled — moments that her campaign hopes will reach voters who increasingly get their news from digital sources.
“I want to bring my daughters to the White House to meet this Black woman president,” comedian Chris Rock said.
The in-the-round stage has the appearance of a college campus, with faux brick pillars and a background of trees and green turf under the chairs of the several hundred guests in the audience. Dozens more supporters were featured on video screens in the hall.
“I look around at these screens, Oprah, and I look at who’s in the room, and this is America,” Harris said.
The event is meant as a unifying event of Harris supporter groups that spun off organically after a “Black Women for Harris” call drew tens of thousands of viewers — and raised $1.5 million — in the hours after Harris took over for Biden after he ended his campaign. They included “White Dudes for Harris,” “Comedians for Harris” and ‘Swifties for Harris.”
The event included a direct call to action to viewers to volunteer for Harris’ campaign and to make calls and knock on doors for the Democrat.
Winfrey ended with a call “for all decent people, for all caring people” to back Harris, saying of Trump, “We’re better than this.”

BOSTON (AP) — Dominic Fletcher’s RBI double sparked a five-run ninth inning and the Chicago White Sox avoided a three-game sweep with a 7-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Sunday.
Chicago starter Chris Flexen’s winless streak extended to 21 straight starts — the longest in team history — after he was pulled with the game tied in the seventh inning. The 30-year-old right-hander gave up two runs on six hits, striking out six and walking one.
The White Sox had lost his previous 20 starts, which is a major league record. 
“Just show up everyday and try to get better each week,” Flexen said of the personal streak. “Just stick with my routine and focus on getting ready for every start. ... Just continue to stick with the routine, work hard and not give up. Just compete — that’s all you can do.”
Chicago (33-111) had lost 14 of its last 15 games before rallying against Boston reliever Zack Kelly (6-3). Zach DeLoach added a two-run single in the ninth inning.
“Just a lot of guys competing, a lot of guys that want to win and just go out there and compete,” Fletcher said. “Even though we’ve been struggling a little bit lately, we want to go out there and compete and try to win every game.” 
The MLB-worst White Sox are nine losses away from tying the 1962 New York Mets for the most losses since 1900, and are on pace to finish 37-125. The 1899 Cleveland Spiders hold the MLB loss record at 20-134.


Wilyer Abreu and Connor Wong had solo homers for Boston, which lost for the 10th time in 16 games and trails Minnesota for the American League’s third and final wild-card spot.
“We didn’t do much today offensively,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “They put the ball in play, found some holes, obviously, the ninth inning that happened, but offensively we didn’t do much.” 
Fraser Ellard (2-2) got two outs in relief and earned the victory.
After Fletcher’s double, Jacob Amaya had an RBI single before DeLoach’s runs-scoring hit. Luis Robert Jr. added a sacrifice fly.
Boston starter Richard Fitts made his major league debut and worked 5 2/3 solid innings. The 24-year-old right-hander allowed two unearned runs, six hits with two strikeouts and a walk.
“It was a lot of fun,” said Fitts, who had about 20 family and friends present for his debut. “Today was really special just because I got to share it with my family and I’m really honored to be a Red Sox for today and hopefully for a long time.”
Fitts was pulled in the sixth with a runner on third. Korey Lee’s infield hit off Greg Weissert gave Chicago a 2-1 lead. Fitts allowed the first run in the sixth on Andrew Benintendi’s ground out after DeLoach reached second after first baseman Triston Casas misplayed his grounder for an error.
Abreu tied the game at 2 with his 15th homer, a drive estimated at 427 feet that traveled over Boston’s bullpen in the bottom half of the sixth.
Wong’s 13th homer of the season reached the last row of seats above the Green Monster in the second.
Recalled from Triple-A Worcester before the game, Fitts was acquired from the New York Yankees along with Weissert and another minor league pitcher for outfielder Alex Verdugo during the offseason.
Red Sox: Cora said RHP Tanner Houck would be pushed back for extra rest and start on Friday in the second of a four-game series at the New York Yankees. … Cora plans to use Trevor Story every day until the shortstop feels like he needs the rest. Story came off the injured list and played Saturday, following what was expected to be season-ending shoulder surgery in April.
White Sox: Open a three-game series Monday at home against Cleveland. RHP Ben Lively (11-9, 4.07 ERA) is set to start for the Guardians. The White Sox starter has not been named.
Red Sox: RHP Brayan Bello (12-7, 4.75) is scheduled to start Monday in the opener of a three-game series against Baltimore. The Orioles haven’t announced a starter.

Authorities on Monday night ended a shelter-in-place order for more than 90,000 people east of Atlanta following a weekend chemical plant fire that sent a massive plume of dark smoke into the Georgia sky and led to complaints about a strong chemical smell and haze.
The smell had spread to Atlanta by Monday, prompting firefighters to use detectors to check the air quality in various parts of the city, Mayor Andre Dickens said.
The Rockdale County Emergency Management Agency lifted the shelter-in-place order and the evacuation zone after Environmental Protection Agency readings for the area showed things were safe. It said businesses could operate as normal on Tuesday.
Northeast of Atlanta, Arynne Johnson took her Great Danes outside in Suwanee on Monday morning when she encountered a foggy air that “slapped you in the face,” she recalled.
“I used to work at a water park, and it felt like walking into a pool house,” she said.
Closer to the source of the fire, officials said chlorine, a harmful irritant, had been detected in the air from the fire at the BioLab plant in Conyers, Georgia, the Rockdale County government said in a statement Monday. The plant is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of downtown Atlanta.
People in the northern part of Rockdale County, north of Interstate 20, were ordered to evacuate on Sunday, and others were told to shelter in place.


Sheriff’s office spokesperson Christine Nesbitt didn’t know the number of people evacuated, though it covered a large portion of the community of Conyers. Media reports said the number was about 17,000.
The best practice for sheltering in place is to “turn the air conditioning off and keep windows and doors shut,” Rockdale County officials said.
Emergency management officials in Fulton County, which encompasses much of Atlanta, said people concerned about the haze or smell should follow the same advice: stay indoors, close their windows and doors and turn off the air conditioning.
Residents of at least three large metro Atlanta counties — Fulton, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties — on Monday reported seeing a haze or the strong smell of chlorine.
In Atlanta, officials believe the hazy conditions and chemical smell is related to the BioLab fire, the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management Agency said in a statement.
Employees were testing the air on Monday for chemicals including chlorine, hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide.
By early Monday afternoon, “no immediate life safety issues have been identified,” Atlanta Fire Rescue reported. Further testing was ongoing.
In Suwanee, Johnson said she got a headache, she’s been coughing and “my upper chest and throat have been tight all day.”
Georgia’s largest school system — Gwinnett County Public Schools — initially canceled all outdoor activities and events on Monday. School officials added that they’ve also taken steps to stop outside air from coming into its buildings. Monday afternoon, the school system reversed course, and said that after-school activities could be held.
The DeKalb County School District also announced that no after-school outdoor activities or athletics would take place Monday.
Closer to the fire, students in Rockdale County Public Schools were already out of the school for a fall break. In nearby Newton County, schools closed Monday, partly because of the large size of the evacuation zone.
The fire ignited when a sprinkler head malfunctioned around 5 a.m. Sunday at the BioLab plant in Conyers, Rockdale County Fire Chief Marian McDaniel told reporters. The malfunction caused water to mix with a water-reactive chemical, producing a plume of chemicals.
McDaniel said there were employees inside the plant, but no injuries were reported, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. 
The fire was brought under control around 4 p.m. Sunday, officials said.
BioLab’s website says it is the swimming pool and spa water care division of Lawrenceville, Georgia-based KIK Consumer Products. The Conyers facility opened in 1973.
In May 2004, a huge fire in a warehouse at the Conyers complex set off multiple explosions and prompted the evacuation of 300 people as a chlorine-laden cloud rolled through the area, the Associated Press reported at the time. The plume of green, gray and white smoke stretched 10 miles (16 kilometers) long. At least nine people went to hospitals with complaints of burning eyes and lungs.
In June 2015, six Rockdale County firefighters were hurt in a fire at the complex, but none of the injuries were life-threatening, the Rockdale Citizen reported at the time. Another fire the following year prompted some voluntary evacuations near the plant, the newspaper reported.
In September 2020, a chemical fire at the same plant in Conyers prompted authorities to shut down both directions of Interstate 20 during morning rush hour. Inside the plant, BioLab workers used forklifts to try and move chemicals away from decomposing chemicals to prevent the catastrophe, but their forklifts were sliding on the wet floor and fumes of chemicals were forming. Firefighters’ access to the situation was hindered by poorly stacked pallets of materials, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board later determined. Nine firefighters were evaluated at hospitals after inhaling hazardous vapors.",False

NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Just a month ago, the long-awaited Jackson Arnold era was underway at Oklahoma.
Hopes from the team and its rabid fans were high. The former five-star quarterback seemed ready to take his place among the greats at a school that has produced four Heisman winners this century at the position.
Now, Arnold is fighting for his job after turning the ball over three times in the first half against Tennessee on Saturday night. Michael Hawkins Jr. sparked the Sooners in the second half of the 25-15 loss, and now coach Brent Venables has declared the position open heading into the next game, Sept. 28 at Auburn.
Venables addressed the quarterback situation in his opening statement after the game, and then shared what he’ll be looking for during the week.
“Who’s the most consistent, who can execute the basics of our offense consistently,” he said. “It’s not real complicated. And then you’ve got to get in the game, and then you’ve got to perform, too.”
Arnold’s mistakes were the main reason Tennessee led 19-3 at the break. Twice in the second quarter, Oklahoma’s defense recovered fumbles by Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava. Both times, Arnold fumbled the ball back to Tennessee on the very next play. The second time was on a backwards pass — something Venables said wasn’t even an option on the play.
Arnold completed 7 of 16 passes for 54 yards with an interception and ran five times for minus-21 yards with two lost fumbles before getting benched.


“There’s some times that Jackson, (was) inconsistent,” Venables said. “That inconsistency led to us not being in any kind of rhythm. You’ve got to take the ones that are there and go back and look at it and see where the ownership lies, but I feel confident that (replacing Arnold) was the right move under the circumstances.”
Hawkins, a true freshman, had some good moments and helped the Sooners outscore the Volunteers 12-6 in the second half. He completed 11 of 18 passes for 132 yards and a touchdown, and ran for 22 yards. His mobility helped the Sooners overcome an overwhelmed offensive line.
It wasn’t all smooth for Hawkins — he fumbled the shotgun snap on his first play late in the second quarter, but he fell on the ball. It took him a few drives in the third quarter to settle in.
“The biggest thing for me is just trying to stay relaxed,” he said. “I have our guys around me building me up, and just knowing they’re behind me, so when I get in, we can just move the ball and capitalize on big plays.”
Arnold was inconsistent before Saturday’s game. He got his first start in the Alamo Bowl loss to Arizona last season, and he passed for 361 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw three interceptions. This season, he hadn’t passed for more than 200 yards in any of his three previous starts. He couldn’t get the offense moving in a 16-12 win over Houston. He threw an interception against Tulane that was returned for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, but Oklahoma held on to win. 
As Arnold struggled, the talented Hawkins stayed ready. He was named a four-star prospect by ESPN, On3, and Rivals, enrolled in January and immediately made an impression. When asked in August why Hawkins beat out transfer Casey Thompson for the backup job, Venables said it was as much about mental makeup as talent.
Venables was impressed with the way Hawkins handled being thrown into the Sooners’ first SEC game.
“He’s confident,” Venables said. “He’s loose in the right ways. The moment’s not going to overwhelm him, even though again he’s a young guy.”
Venables said there’s still plenty of work ahead for Hawkins.
“Mike gets pretty excited — you saw him,” Venables said. “He’s three or four steps ahead of the play a few times. That’s going to happen too. Certainly got to slow things down and let things develop, there’s that piece of it. But he’s a great competitor, got a tremendous amount of talent, and he cares.”
Venables said there’s a lot for he and offensive coordinator Seth Littrell to evaluate. He wants to give the situation the proper attention rather than acting on impulse.
“You give some grace, and yet, there’s a body of work that you evaluate,” Venables said. “You maintain a perspective. You know that there’s a pace at which everybody grows and matures to some degree. When I talk about having some grace, young guys are going to make some mistakes.”

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers practiced Monday but remains questionable to play with an abdomen strain when the No. 1 Longhorns face Mississippi State in their Southeastern Conference opener, coach Steve Sarkisian said.
Ewers sat out last weekend’s 51-3 win over Louisiana-Monroe, and Arch Manning threw two touchdowns and two interceptions in earning his first career victory as a starter.
And if Ewers can’t play Saturday against Mississippi State (1-3, 0-1), it will be Manning leading the Longhorns (4-0) into the program’s first game in the SEC.
Ewers was injured in the first half of Texas’ win over UTSA. He at first laid on the field, then walked slowly to the sideline medical tent before leaving the field. He was on the sideline with the Longhorns on Saturday but was not in uniform.
The injury came on a long pass and was not caused by contact, Sarkisian has said.
“He (Ewers) has got to do enough to show me he can play. Can he execute the game plan?” Sarkisian said. “I want to make sure he’s healthy enough to play at a high level.”
Ewers “keeps getting incrementally better,” Sarkisian said.
Sarkisian said he trusts Ewers to be honest with him about any pain he feels when deciding whether to play this week or continue to rest.
“The beauty of it for Quinn and I is our time together (and) him having to come back from injuries previously,” Sarkisian said.


Ewers has missed two games each of the previous two seasons with sternum and shoulder injuries. After playing Mississippi State, Texas will have a week off before facing rival Oklahoma in the annual matchup in Dallas.
Ewers may be anxious to get back on the field. He opted to return to Texas this season instead of entering the NFL draft last spring, and has garnered early-season attention as a Heisman Trophy contender after Texas dominated Michigan in Week 2.
“Him being honest with me, is in his best interest, in our best interest,” Sarkisian said. “I’ll do everything in my power to put him in the best position to be successful if he plays. And if he doesn’t, what does that look like moving forward?”
Manning, a second-year freshman, has shown he is more than capable of leading Texas if Ewers remains out another week.
He dazzled with five touchdown passes and a 67-yard touchdown run against UTSA. His game against Louisiana-Monroe was an uneven follow-up with two interceptions and some missed throws in a night with a 52% completion rate. Several other passes were thrown into tight coverage.
After the game, Manning rated his first career start as a “C-plus.”
Sarkisian has noted that when Ewers is healthy enough to return, he remains the starter.
“Arch believes in his ability and he’s going to take his (deep) shots. And we’ve reaped the benefits of it,” Sarkisian said. “But he’ll learn some of those explosive plays are checkdowns.”

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Ashton Jeanty ran for 259 yards and four touchdowns, Matt Lauter had four catches for 96 yards and two scores and No. 25 Boise State surged past Washington State 45-24 on Saturday night.
Playing its first game as a ranked team since 2020, Boise State (3-1) pulled away in the fourth quarter against its future Pac-12 Conference rival. Washington State (4-1) had no answer for Jeanty — and no ground game of its own.
Jeanty, who entered the game leading the nation in rushing yards per game with 195.3, wasted little time. On Boise State’s fifth play from scrimmage, he broke four tackles around the line of scrimmage before outracing the rest of the defense on a 64-yard TD run. He finished with 26 carries and had a 7-yard reception.
“He was relentless,” Boise State coach Spencer Danielson said. “Talk about a guy who puts his team on his back, loves this team, and will find a way to score because that’s what the team needs — that’s Ashton. When your best players are your hardest workers, you’ve always got a shot.”
Jeanty, who now has 845 yards on 82 carries with 13 touchdowns this season, had his fourth 200-yard game, tying the school record.
“We just got beat in all three phases, and pretty decisively,” Washington State coach Jake Dickert said. “Jeanty was incredible. Ten yards a carry. Obviously you’ve got to hold him to less than that if you want to win the football game.”


The Cougars responded with a quick strike of theirs own when quarterback John Mateer needed only three plays to go 65 yards, firing a 14-yard TD pass to Cooper Mathers.
Jeanty added a 14-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter to give the Broncos a 17-10 halftime lead.
Despite stifling Boise State’s offense early in the second half, Dickert gambled on a fourth-and-inches from his own 27 late in the third quarter. But Boise State’s defense stiffened, denying Mateer the half-yard he needed.
“When it’s inches to go, when it’s fourth-and-1 for the past two and a half years, we’ve gone for it every time,” Dickert said. “That’s what we’re going to do. That’s how we play.”
Three plays later, Maddux Madsen hit Lauter on a 22-yard scoring strike to push Boise State’s lead to 24-10 with 1:22 left in the third quarter.
Then, after another Washington State touchdown halved the deficit, Jeanty ripped off another electrifying run, this time racing 59 yards by breaking three tackles and eluding another on the goal line to dive in for the score.
Mateer threw for 327 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Wayshawn Parker led Washington State in rushing with 35 yards.
Madsen threw for 184 yards and two touchdowns for Boise State.
The Boise State defense recorded seven sacks resulting in 67 lost yards.
Boise State: The Broncos appear to be in the driver’s seat for a playoff bid among the Group of 5 conferences—and on a collision course with Mountain West conference foe UNLV. The two teams clash on Oct. 25 and could meet again for the conference title with a playoff bid on the line.
Washington State: The Cougars will use their off week to work on shoring up a porous defense that has given up 52 and 45 points, respectively, in their last two outings.
Boise State: Hosts Utah State on Saturday.
Washington State: At Fresno State on Oct 12.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agree that Russia should be included in a future peace conference aimed at ending Russia’s war against Ukraine. He called for stepped up efforts to solve the conflict. 
A previous peace conference June 15-16 in Switzerland ended with 78 countries expressing support for Ukraine’s “territorial integrity” but otherwise left the path forward unclear. Russia did not participate. 
“I believe that now is the moment when we must discuss how we get out of this war situation faster than the current impression is,” Scholz said in an interview with Germany’s ZDF public television aired Sunday. 
“There will certainly be a further peace conference, and the president and I agree that it must be one with Russia present,” Scholz said. 
Scholz is facing more political discontent at home over his government’s support including money and weapons for Ukraine after populist parties that oppose arming Ukraine did well in state elections Sept. 1 at the expense of parties in his three-party governing coalition. Some members of his Social Democratic Party have also called for more emphasis on diplomacy toward Russia. 
Zelenskyy has presented a 10-point peace formula that calls for the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukrainian territory and accountability for war crimes.",False

Publication date:2024-09-23 16:27:00

NEW YORK (AP) — Jeanine Tesori watched the world premiere run of her “Grounded” with director Michael Mayer last fall at the Kennedy Center and noticed audience fidgeting.
“It didn’t need a transplant of a liver, but what it needed was maybe just a different approach,” Mayer recalled.
“Some rhinoplasty,” Tesori interjected. “A tracheotomy at one point.”
Tesori becomes the first woman composer to open a season in the Metropolitan Opera’s 141-year history when a revised “Grounded” starring mezzo-soprano Emily D’Angelo is given a gala premiere on Monday night. Thirty-five minutes have been cut since the six Kennedy Center performances, the first act trimmed from 82 to 60 and the second from 62 to 49. A Trainer character was eliminated.
“You don’t know until you know. And then you know,” Tesori said.
This is the fourth opera by Tesori after “A Blizzard on Marblehead Neck” (2011), “The Lion, the Unicorn, and Me” (2013) and “Blue” (2019). She won Tony Awards for the scores of “Fun Home” and “Kimberly Akimbo,” and Mayer won for directing “Spring Awakening.”
They have to adjust far less stage rehearsal time for opera than theater.
“The work doesn’t really start until you’re in previews when we’re doing musicals, whether it’s out of town or Broadway,” Mayer said. “It’s like triage. You deal with the bleeders right away, but then you have the time to look at what the next major things are.”


Based on George Brant’s one-woman play, “Grounded” tells the story of Jess, a fighter pilot grounded due to her pregnancy who becomes a Las Vegas-based drone pilot and crashes her Reaper rather than kill a young girl as collateral damage to a Middle Eastern target. 
Brant wrote the play in 2011 after reading about the drone program in a “Stars and Stripes” online report. It opened in 2013 and gained attention with a 2015 New York Public Theater production starring Anne Hathaway. Brant also wrote the libretto and expanded the cast to include a husband Eric (tenor Ben Bliss), Commander (bass-baritone Greer Grimsley), Sensor (baritone Kyle Miller), an alter ego character Also Jess (soprano Ellie Dehn) and a chorus. 
D’Angelo spoke with fighter pilots in her preparation.
“So much care was taken in really honoring and being true to what they do,” D’Angelo said. “There’s no caricature at work here. It’s all taken very seriously.”
On the day of the final Washington National Opera performance last Nov. 13, Tesori met in an upstairs rehearsal room with Mayer, dramaturg Paul Cremo, choreographer David Neumann and Mayer assistant Marcus Shields. The meeting started at 12:30 p.m. and stretched for 9 1/2 hours, resulting in a book filled with bullet points detailing needed changes. Tesori composed in a rented house on Long Island’s North Fork, taking a break for a January workshop and completing the revised score by April 1.
Met music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin was surprised Tesori made more cuts when rehearsals started in August. About 45 minutes of music was jettisoned from the world premiere version of last Oct. 28 and 10 minutes of new composition added.
“I was kind of defending the composer as we would do today if Verdi was alive or Donizetti: ‘The music is perfect as it is. Let’s not cut,’” Nézet-Séguin said. “It was fascinating to see that the composer herself was more like: `No, this needs to be cut because it’s detracting from what I want in the story line.’”
Ethel M. Smyth’s “Der Wald (The Forest)” was the first opera by a woman composer at the Met in 1903 and Kaija Saariaho’s “L’Amour de Loin (Love from Afar)” the second in 2016. After “Grounded,” the Met has three works by women scheduled in 2026: Saariaho’s “Innocence” (opening April 6), Gabriela Lena Frank’s “El Último Sueño de Frida y Diego” (May 14) and Missy Mazzoli’s “Lincoln in the Bardo” (Oct. 23).
“If we are claiming that opera needs to appeal to everyone and needs to be related and connected to the life experiences of everyone in the audience, we do have to present on the stage the vision of everyone,” Nézet-Séguin said. “I’m convinced it’s a very different perspective, and even the music sounds different because it’s a woman composing it.”
Mimi Lien’s set is dominated by 224 LED tiles, 140 panels and 28 half panels manufactured by ROE and rented from 4Wall Entertainment in a video design by Jason Thompson and Kaitlyn Pietras.
“I was interested in the kind of combination between image and space or between actual physical, tangible structure and virtual imagery and how to combine those,” Lien said, “colored with the overall context of drone warfare and surveillance and the kind of preponderance of imagery into our daily lives.”
There will be eight Met performances through Oct. 19, with the last televised to movie theaters worldwide.
Met opening night puts a spotlight on performers, productions and composers for an audience attending the start of New York’s social season, whom Nézet-Séguin termed “people who come to the opera just rarely or civic leaders or socialites and people from different industries.”
“It’s important to show them what our values are and who we are as an institution,” he said.
Met general manager Pete Gelb has put a post-pandemic emphasis on contemporary composers.
“I’m living right now,” Tesori said playfully during a Sept. 9 creative team and cast discussion at the Guggenheim Museum. “We’ll see how next week goes.”

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Jayden Daniels flashed promise in his Washington debut, but a Commanders defense that ranked last in the NFL a year ago was ineffective again in Sunday’s season-opening 37-20 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Daniels ran for two touchdowns. Washington is aiming for a fresh start with the 2023 Heisman Trophy winner and second overall draft pick this year at quarterback.
“I just try to do whatever it takes to help the team win the game,” Daniels said. “We didn’t win. Obviously not the way I would want it go, but we finished strong.”
Daniels directed a pair of scoring drives over the final 17 minutes. He finished with 88 yards rushing on 16 attempts and went 17 of 24 passing for 184 yards and no interceptions. The Bucs sacked him twice.
Daniels had his helmet knocked off twice on tackles.
“Some of the ones we like where he can extended the play with his legs,” Washington coach Dan Quinn said. “That’s what does make him unique. But we certainly don’t want the ones that are inside and where the helmet gets knocked around. Those are things that we can work through, for sure.”
Daniels believes he had his helmet dislodged twice in game while in college.
“Probably,” Daniels said. “I’m just playing football back there. Your helmet is going to pop off no matter ... if you got it buckled up tight or loose at the end of the day.”
The Commanders defense allowed points on seven of nine Tampa Bay possessions, including the final one when the Buccaneers ran off the final 1:12.


The Bucs outgained Washington 392 yards to 299, and had a third-down conversion rate of 69.2% (9 for 13).

“I think the assessment defensively, I wasn’t as pleased with third down,” Quinn said. “I thought that was the biggest story of this game. I think third down overall collectively defensively, not just the secondary.”
The Commanders’ offense was 2 of 8 (25%) on third down.
Daniels, the former LSU star, was one of three rookie starting quarterbacks in Week 1, along with No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams of the Chicago Bears and 12th pick Bo Nix of the Denver Broncos. He joined Robert Griffin III (2012) as the only rookies to start a season opener for Washington since 1967.
“Once that ball is snapped, (the nerves) go away,” Daniels said. “You’re playing football again. That’s the same game I’ve been playing since I was a kid. Even though the stakes are high, I still refer back to that time I was 7 years old playing against my friends.”

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — For the Miami Dolphins, the day started with chaos and ended with celebration.
Jason Sanders nailed a 52-yard field goal as time expired, and the Dolphins — on probably one of the more bizarre days in their history, one where two players were placed in handcuffs outside the stadium a few hours before kickoff — rallied past the Jacksonville Jaguars 20-17 on Sunday to win their fourth straight season opener.
Fresh off a big offseason payday, Tua Tagovailoa threw for 336 yards and a touchdown and led Miami on an eight-play, 31-yard drive over the final 2:09.
“We just needed to get our head out of our (butt),” said Tagovailoa, who gave an impassioned halftime address, calling out both teammates and coaches with Miami down 17-7. “That was it. That was it.”
Tyreek Hill started the comeback with 80-yard touchdown catch that sparked Miami’s sluggish offense in the third quarter and got the Dolphins within 17-14. After the score, Hill placed his hands behind his back as if to simulate being handcuffed, hours after he was placed facedown and handcuffed on a street by Miami-Dade Police officers after being stopped for a traffic violation near Hard Rock Stadium.
“I have no idea, for real. No idea. No idea, man. It was crazy. No idea,” Hill said when asked why he was handcuffed after being stopped, he said, for speeding and reckless driving. “I wasn’t disrespectful because my mom didn’t raise me that way. Didn’t cuss. Didn’t do none of that. Like I said, I’m still trying to figure it out, man.”


So, too, were the police. Miami-Dade officials reacted quickly, saying an investigation was already opened into the officers’ conduct and that one of the officers was placed on administrative leave.

Seeing that Hill was handcuffed, defensive tackle Calais Campbell stopped to assist as he drove past the scene. He, too, was handcuffed, saying officers told him the reason why was that he disobeyed their direct orders.
“That’s definitely a first,” Campbell said. “It is definitely startling, especially with probably our best player. That’s not what you want to see.”
Hill finished with seven catches for 130 yards. Devon Achane seven catches for 75 yards and ran for 25 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries.
Sanders tied the game with a 36-yard field goal with 4:22 left, and the Dolphins’ defense stepped up from there, sacking Trevor Lawrence on consecutive plays to set up Tagovailoa for the winning drive.
Lawrence, who also signed a big contract extension in the offseason, completed 12 of 21 passes for 162 yards and a touchdown. Tank Bigsby had 73 yards on 12 carries.
Rookie receiver Brian Thomas Jr. had a 14-yard touchdown catch and drew a pass-interference call on cornerback Jalen Ramsey — who had been listed as questionable with a hamstring injury — on Jacksonville’s first touchdown drive. The play set up Jacksonville at the 1-yard line and Travis Etienne ran it in from there.
Etienne had the ball punched from his grasp by Dolphins safety Jevon Holland just before crossing the goal line in the third. Miami scored one play later when Tagovailoa found a streaking Hill, who outran two Jaguars defenders into the end zone.
“Obviously turnovers are killers, especially down in the red zone,” Lawrence said, “but I thought Travis did a good job of bouncing back and keeping his head in the game. ... We still had plenty of time in the game, and we have to be able to handle the adversity and go score in the next series.”
After the Dolphins got a fourth-down stop on Jacksonville’s next drive, Sanders missed a 42-yard field goal that would have tied it.
Achane had a 1-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, but besides that, the opening half of the season was mostly a dud for the Dolphins, who were expected to be as good or better offensively after bringing back most of the weapons from a unit that led the NFL in total yards in 2023.
Miami turned the ball over on downs twice and punted four times before Hill’s touchdown.
“The thing that really motivated me the most was when we come in during halftime, and this is like the first time I heard Tua’s Hawaiian accent,” Hill said. “It’s crazy. He was turned up and animated in the locker room. I’m like, ’Ok, I’m liking this.’”
Jaylen Waddle had five receptions for 109 yards, including a 63-yard catch that set up Miami at the Jacksonville 26 while trailing by 10. Miami went backwards for three straight plays, though, and Tagovailoa took a third-down sack that knocked the Dolphins out of field goal range.
Jaguars: CB Tyson Campbell left with a hamstring injury in the fourth.
Dolphins: Waddle was evaluated for a concussion after taking a hard hit in the first half but returned a couple of plays later. ... LB David Long left in the third quarter with a hand injury but returned. 
Jaguars: Host Cleveland next Sunday.
Dolphins: Host Buffalo on Thursday night.

And her coaching career took off - The Associated Press
Publication date:2024-09-23 07:00:00

SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Christine Bumstead’s path toward being an assistant coach in a preseason game for the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers started in a most unusual way.
She went deer hunting.
Her journey took off when hockey — and the rest of the world — had stopped in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Paul Maurice, then the coach of the Winnipeg Jets, knew Bumstead’s father and decided to join him on a hunting trip. On the way there, she and Maurice talked hockey, talked philosophy, talked systems. The drive took 25 minutes. Maurice was blown away.
“We got out of the car and I went, ‘Oh, that’s a coach,’” Maurice said.
Fast forward about four years. Bumstead was invited to be part of a development camp with the Panthers this summer, then invited back for training camp that started last week and on Sunday — to her surprise — she was behind the bench with the Cup champs for a preseason game against Nashville.
“It’s probably the best seats you can get,” Bumstead said after Florida’s win. “It’s super special to me.”
Bumstead is part of the NHL Coaches Association Female Coaches Program, which is working with about 100 women this year on their development in the game — including Melissa Samoskevich, the sister of Panthers prospect Mackie Samoskevich. Bumstead leaves Florida this week to get back to her primary jobs, those being an assistant coach for the women’s team at the University of Saskatchewan and performance coach for the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League. She also serves as head coach of Canada’s national deaf women’s hockey team.
When Bumstead — who also has experience as a teacher — started to focus on coaching, she thought it might be short-term. It didn’t take her long to change her thinking. She’s now hoping it’s her calling. Maurice helped get her into the NHLCA program and has spoken highly of her ever since.


“I played competitively, and I thought I was driven, but now as a coach I’m realizing that I had no drive as a player at all in comparison,” Bumstead said. “I am way more competitive as a coach than I ever was as a player. So, I just think that’s obviously I’m on the right side of the bench. I didn’t know that until I started coaching at a higher level. And I realized I had the juice for this way more than I ever did as a player.”
There is some real momentum for women in the NHL. This season, Jessica Campbell will make some history as the first on-the-bench assistant coach in league history. She was hired by the Seattle Kraken this summer after two years as an assistant for the team’s AHL affiliate. That came after Emily Engel-Natzke was hired by the Washington Capitals in 2022 as video coach, making her the first woman with a full-time assistant role in the league.
Other women have gotten preseason opportunities as assistants in recent years and the numbers of women in the NHL in front-office or some sort of coaching roles is soaring. There will be a female head coach in the NHL, Maurice said. It’s not if. It’s when.
“That day is coming,” Maurice said. “Certainly, there’s some experience and expertise that you have to acquire before you get to be an NHL head coach. And now there are women that are getting that experience and getting that expertise.”
Bumstead is certain she’ll leave Florida as a better coach. She thought she was detail-oriented before getting to this training camp. But seeing how Maurice and the Panthers prepare with precise detail every day, combined with getting an up-close view of Matthew Tkachuk, Aleksander Barkov, Sam Reinhart and the rest of the Cup champs, quickly gave her a very different perspective.
“I’m definitely bringing back so much more than I thought,” Bumstead said.
Training camp is like a dream for coaches who love nothing more than sitting around with others and talking hockey all day. Bumstead has gotten that experience over the last few days with Florida, plus time being part of the on-ice instruction. Maurice didn’t tell her until Saturday that she would be behind the bench on Sunday.
A half-hour after the game ended, she was still excited. “It means I got the full experience, for sure,” Bumstead said.
Having Bumstead next to him wasn’t a throwaway move for Maurice on Sunday. He wanted Bumstead to see the NHL game from that perspective. He also wanted people in hockey to see Bumstead behind the bench of the Cup champs.
“Coaches will view the game a lot of times better from the bench than they will from up top,” Maurice said. “It’s not what we’re used to seeing. So, she gets it. She’s a good coach. And I think, when you talk about opportunity and maybe exposure as well, she’s going to get an opportunity to be a head coach somewhere down the line. … She’ll get there.”

DILI, East Timor (AP) — East Timor pulled out all stops for Pope Francis’ historic visit to one of the world’s youngest and poorest countries to the tune of $12 million, drawing rebuke from activists and human rights organizations in a nation where almost half the population lives in poverty. 
The cost for the two-day visit starting Monday was approved by the government through the Council of Ministers in February, including $1 million to build an altar for a papal Mass. 
Walls were still being dabbed with fresh paint and banners and billboards filled the streets of the seaside capital, Dili, to welcome the pontiff, who earlier visited Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.

About 42% of East Timor’s population of 1.3 million live below the poverty line, according to the U.N. Development Program. Unemployment is high, job opportunities in the formal sector are generally limited and most people are subsistence farmers with no steady income.
The country’s budget for 2023 was $3.16 billion. The government had earmarked only $4.7 million to increase food production, said Marino Fereira, a researcher at Timor Leste Institute for Development Monitoring and Analysis. He said the $12 million expense for the papal visit “was exaggerating.” 
The non-governmental agency, known locally as Lao Hamutuk, has submitted several papers to the government and parliament asking to cut expenditures on ceremonies and prioritize issues that affect people, Fereira said.


“The governments have ignored the poor in the country,” he said.
East Timor has recently faced challenges of high inflation and weather changes that have reduced cereal production, pushing some 364,000 people, or 27% of the population, to experience acute food insecurity from May to September, according to the U.N.’s Food and Agricultural Organization.

East Timor’s Minister of State Administration Tomas Cabral, who heads the national organizing committee for the pope’s visit, said the $12 million was excessive but it was also being used for infrastructure development, such as road constructions, renovating churches and other public facilities. 
“Don’t compare our country with neighboring nations that have proper facilities and infrastructure to host international events or high-ranking state guests,“ Cabral said. ”Here, we have to build it from the scratch.”
Cabral said that about $1.2 million has been allocated for transportation and logistics of people from across the country to welcome the pontiff and attend his Mass on Tuesday. 
East Timor views the visit as a prime opportunity to put the world’s spotlight on the small nation with a turbulent path to independence. It’s the youngest country in Asia where 97% of the population identify as Catholic. 
“The pope’s visit is the biggest, the best marketing anyone can aspire to promote the country, to put the country on the tourist map,” East Timor’s President Jose Ramos-Horta said in an interview with The Associated Press last week.
The highlight of Francis’ visit will be a Eucharistic celebration on Tuesday where more than 300,000 faithful are expected, including several thousands living from near the border of Indonesia’s West Timor, the western part of the island of Timor. 
The papal Mass in Tasitolu, an open field on the coast some 8 kilometers (nearly 5 miles) from downtown Dili, is also causing displeasure. The government has bulldozed about 185 families and confiscated 23 hectares (57 acres) of land for the event. Rights groups accuse the government of not offering any alternatives to poor families.
“The lives of those families are uncertain at the moment, they don’t know where to go as they are still there waiting for compensation,” said Pedrito Vieira, coordinator of the Land Network, a coalition of NGOs advocating land rights. “Sudden eviction will only give them uncertainty to plan their life.”
Cabral said those were settlers and not traditional landowners who were squatting on state land. He said they were given advance notices and time to remove their structures and move out. 
“There have been those who have politicized the situation there so that the illegal settlers have refused to move for unclear reasons,” Cabral said. 
Several violent crackdowns on street vendors ostensibly to ensure order in Dili ahead of Francis’ trip also drew outcry among rights activists.
Social media were flooded with angry comments after footage showed dozens of alleged plainclothes police officers with sticks, crowbars and spears destroying vendor stands and goods in one of the paths where the pope’s entourage will pass.

Suzana Cardoso, a veteran journalist who recorded the incident last week in Dili’s Fatuhada neighborhood, told The Associated Press that she received threats in an attempt to stop her from sharing the video. 
“I have a moral obligation as a journalist to uphold justice for those weak and poor,” said Cardoso, who also covered the country’s darkest days when Indonesia responded to East Timor’s U.N.-backed vote seeking independence 25 years ago with a scorched-earth campaign that shocked the world. About 1,500 people were killed, more than 300,000 were displaced and over 80% of East Timor’s infrastructure was destroyed.
Ramos-Horta instructed the police and Dili city administration to arrest those behind the destruction of vendor stands and compensate the traders.
“The government has never been instructed to carry out public order with violence,” Ramos-Horta said in a news conference. 
“A free and independent press is protected by law in this country,” he said. “I appeal to all institutions not to hinder journalists and to respect press freedom.”",False

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Tennessee Volunteers made a big statement on Saturday night.
Quarterback Nico Iamaleava combined for 276 yards and three touchdowns, former walk-on safety Will Brooks’ 85-yard interception return for a score highlighted a dominant defensive performance and the 14th-ranked Vols trounced No. 24 North Carolina State 51-10 in the Duke’s Mayo Classic.
Iamaleava completed 16 of 23 passes for 211 yards and threw TDs to Miles Kitselman and Holden Staes. He also ran for 65 yards, including a 31-yard score, as the Vols scored on eight of their 11 possessions with the redshirt freshman under center.
“He played within himself and responded well to adversity and that is one of the things we haven’t seen from him,” Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said of Iamaleava overcoming two interceptions. “I am really proud of his demeanor.”
Despite the two mistakes, Iamaleava passed the first major test of his starting career with flying colors. The Vols have now scored 120 points in their first two games following a 69-3 win over Chattanooga in the opener.
“It was a little sloppy in the beginning but I thought we finished strong in the second half,” Iamaleava said. 
Dylan Sampson ran for 132 yards and two touchdowns as Tennessee (2-0) outgained NC State 460 yards to 143.
Tennessee limited NC State quarterback Grayson McCall to 104 yards passing and forced three turnovers. The Vols held the Wolfpack to 39 yards rushing on 28 carries and NC State’s only touchdown came on a pick-six.


Heupel called it an “elite” defensive performance.
“The standard at Tennessee is to be elite on defense. This is the home of Reggie White, Al Wilson and Eric Berry,” Heupel said.
The offense wasn’t too bad either.
Iamaleava didn’t take long to show off his skillset, breaking containment and outracing two defenders to pick up 12 yards on a third-and-7 play to keep the Vols’ opening drive alive. Tennessee would break through on its second drive with a series of short completions by Iamaleava before Sampson raced nine yards up the middle for a touchdown.
After the teams traded field goals, NC State (1-1) drove deep into Tennessee territory before McCall overthrew tight end Justin Joly in the flat and Brooks grabbed the first interception of his career and raced untouched down the left sideline for the touchdown and a 17-3 lead. It was the 10th-longest INT return for a touchdown in school history and the longest since Daniel Bituli’s 97-yarder against Alabama in 2017.
“That was part of the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Heupel said.
Max Gilbert tacked on a 45-yard field goal at the end of the first half to give the Vols a 17-point lead at the break. 
Things quickly went from bad to worse for NC State in the second half.
On Tennessee’s opening possession of the third quarter, Iamaleava moved the chains with a fourth-down run and then found a wide-open Kitselman down the left sideline for a touchdown.
Dominic Bailey followed with a strip of McCall and recovered at the NC State 22-yard line leading to Gilbert’s third field of the game and the rout was on.
And when NC State was stuffed on a desperation fourth-and-1 run in its own territory, Iamaleava put the game away with a burst up the middle on a QB draw with 4:07 left in the third quarter.
“It got away from us. It snowballed as it went,” NC State coach Dave Doeren said. “We have a lot of work to do to get back to it.”
Doeren said he plans to stick with McCall at quarterback.
“He’s mad at himself, but he has to get back and flush it,” Doeren said. “We have great confidence in Grayson. As a head coach I completely believe in him.”
Offensively the Vols used a lot of two tight end personnel, something that took the Wolfpack by surprise.
“This is deepest our tight end room has been and it will be a part of what we continue to do,” Heupel said. 
Tennessee: The Vols’ up-tempo offense was clicking on all cylinders after the game’s first drive and their defense was outstanding. This has the look of a team that has the potential to compete for a national championship.
NC State: The Wolfpack offense looked completely out of sync as it managed just 27 yards in the second half and turned it over three times. Unlike last week against FCS school Western Carolina, NC State wasn’t able to mount a fourth-quarter rally.
With a strong showing against a Top 25 team, the Vols are likely to move up in the rankings possibly into the Top 10. The Wolfpack can say goodbye to their Top 25 ranking after a lackluster performance last week against Western Carolina and this debacle.
Tennessee: Will be a big favorite on Saturday when it hosts Kent State.
NC State: Returns home to play Louisiana Tech on Saturday.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Kody Clemens singled with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth after Tampa Bay had tied the score in the top of the inning, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Rays 2-1 on Monday night. 
Kyle Schwarber homered and Cristopher Sánchez pitched six shutout innings to help NL East-leading Philadelphia begin a six-game homestand with its 48th home victory of the season. The Phillies entered tied with the Dodgers for the most home wins in baseball. 
“That’s a backyard dream,” Clemens said. “For that moment to come up and get the job done, it’s obviously pretty cool.”
Brandon Lowe hit the tying homer for the Rays, who began play five games out of a wild-card spot in the American League. 
Manuel Rodríguez got the first out in the bottom of the ninth before being relieved by Garrett Cleavinger (3-5), who loaded the bases with two outs on a pair of singles and a walk. Clemens lined a 1-0, 95-mph sinker into right field to draw loud “KO-DY! KO-DY!” cheers from the crowd of 39,511.
“He can hit,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said.
Clemens’ heroics was preceded by a walk to load the bases by minor-league call-up Buddy Kennedy, a native of nearby Millville and the grandson of former Phillies infielder Don Money. Fans loudly chanted “BUD-DY! ”BUD-DY!” during the at-bat.
“It was something very special, and I’ll always remember that for the rest of my life,” Kennedy said.


Kennedy got several texts after the game and expects to trade messages with star slugger Mike Trout, a fellow Millville native.
“I was getting chills,” Clemens said of hearing the chants while in the on-deck circle.
Carlos Estévez (4-4) blew his fifth save and second in six chances with the Phillies since being acquired prior to the July trade deadline in the top of the inning. Lowe led off the ninth with a pinch-hit drive to deep center. Johan Rojas appeared to make a stellar, leaping catch against the wall in left-center in the deepest part of the park, but the ball popped out of Rojas’ glove and over the fence for a home run after his glove hit the top of the outfield wall. 
“My heart kind of dropped a little,” Lowe said. “Thankfully for me, the ball came out of his glove. It was a heck of an effort.”
Said Thomson, “That would’ve been an unbelievable catch, highlight-reel stuff. He did nothing wrong.”
The Phillies finished with five hits but didn’t get their first until Schwarber’s shot with one out in the sixth. 
After Rays opener Cole Sulser pitched a scoreless first, Tyler Alexander retired his first 13 batters before Schwarber’s drive that traveled an estimated 447 feet. It was the sixth homer in seven games for Schwarber. 
Sánchez struck out four and gave up four hits in six innings. Orion Kerkering tossed a 1-2-3 seventh, and Jeff Hoffman worked out of a jam in the eighth.
The Rays were vying for the fifth no-hitter in the majors this season and the second in franchise history, following Matt Garza’s no-hitter against Detroit on July 26, 2010. Philadelphia has been no-hit 22 times, which is the most in baseball.
Tampa Bay threatened in the eighth against Hoffman, putting runners on first and third with two outs on singles by Yandy Díaz and Jonny DeLuca. But Hoffman struck out Junior Caminero for the final out to keep the Rays off the board. 
Thomson said two-time NL MVP Bryce Harper apologized to him after staring down a ball in the ninth inning that went off the wall. Harper ended up only at first base after not running out of the box. 
“He’s accountable and admits to his mistakes,” Thomson said.
Phillies: C JT Realmuto (left knee contusion) was out of the lineup for the third straight game. ... Estévez sustained a left knee contusion after getting drilled by a Josh Lowe liner that went for an infield single with two outs in the ninth. 
Rays: Brandon Lowe hit after sitting out the weekend’s games in Baltimore due to right middle finger inflammation.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — With a win under their belt and no new injuries to account for, the Los Angeles Rams can focus on getting better instead of trying to make sure things don’t get any worse.
“It’s been a while since that’s been the case,” quarterback Matthew Stafford said Wednesday. “Obviously, we got guys behind the scenes trying to get back as fast as they possibly can, but nice to go from one week to the next and not have any changes. So we can kind of try to build off of what we did.”
The Rams (1-2) see the offensive line as the position group particularly likely to benefit from the newfound continuity. They have three of their projected starters — left tackle Alaric Jackson, right guard Kevin Dotson and right tackle Rob Havenstein — back in action while rookie center Beaux Limmer and first-time starter at left guard Logan Bruss got better as the game went on against the San Francisco defensive line on Sunday.
Dotson felt like the group came together in the fourth quarter, helping the Rams overcome a 10-point deficit to win 27-24. The offense gained 126 of its 296 yards in the final 15 minutes, averaging 7.88 yards per play and getting into the red zone three times.
“I felt like it was no hesitation in our play,” Dotson said. “And it felt like we understood what had to be done to get where we wanted to go. Everybody just put their head down, trust the guy next to him, and just play.” 


Working together is the only way for an offensive line to come together, Dotson said. But the Rams benefited from some previous experience among the current configuration that helped jumpstart the process.

Limmer and Truss played next to each other as reserves during training camp, and then Limmer, the sixth-round pick from Arkansas, got time as the first-team center during a joint practice with Houston.
“As far as moving everybody around, it’s kind of real comfortable in there,” Limmer said.
That week in Houston was also important in allowing Limmer to get comfortable with Stafford, who in turn has been able to use his 16 years of experience to help expedite the working relationship between quarterback and the new center.
“So far everything’s going real smooth, and he helps me out with all the protections, all the spots, everything when I need it, so it’s been great,” Limmer said.
Dotson also expressed the value in the new starting five being able to spend time together off the football field, which is equally important with how quickly the unit had been shuffled. 
Steve Avila, who had been expected to start at center but was moved to left guard for the season opener in Detroit, is likely out through October because of an MCL injury. Jonah Jackson, who alternated between center and left guard for the first two weeks, is on injured reserve after aggravating a shoulder injury he sustained in camp. Havenstein missed one game because of an ankle injury, and Alaric Jackson was suspended for two games. 
“I haven’t been on a team where it all happened that fast or having that many people out at one time,” Dotson said.
Even with the victory over the 49ers under their belt, there is plenty of room for the offensive line to improve. The run game has yet to top 98 yards or 3.8 yards per carry. Stafford has been sacked 10 times. Those areas will have to be addressed against the defense of the Chicago Bears (1-2) on Sunday. 
Coach Sean McVay thinks time together is what can allow this iteration of the offensive line, and the Rams as a whole, to be at its best.
“I do think that the best units, whether it’s offensively or defensively, there’s continuity,” McVay said. “There’s a rapport that’s established. There’s kind of an unspoken ability to work in concert and in combination with one another, and that’s what I’m hopeful to start to see us be able to develop, whether that’s offensive line, Matthew with the receivers, backs getting comfortable with some of the different things that we’re doing, and same thing on defense.” 
NOTES: The Rams do not plan on designating CB Darious Williams to return from injured reserve this week. Williams strained his hamstring in training camp.

Publication date:2024-09-22 07:00:00

On this evidence, Arsenal and Manchester City look ready to go the distance again in the Premier League. Whether Mikel Arteta can finally get the better of Pep Guardiola is still unknown. 
A 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday showed Arsenal can certainly go toe-to-toe with the four-time defending champion — but it also confirmed City’s powers of resilience after dominating English soccer for the past six years. 
“Still we have this passion, this fire inside ourselves,” Guardiola said after John Stones rescued a point with an equalizer in the eighth minute of stoppage time. 
Arsenal has been runner-up to City in each of the last two years — setting new benchmarks along the way — but still coming up short. 
Arteta was Guardiola’s former assistant at City and now stands as his biggest threat. 
On Sunday his team looked like snapping City’s 47-game unbeaten home run, despite being down to 10 men for the entirety of the second half after Leandro Trossard was sent off in first-half stoppage time. 
But Arsenal’s resolve was finally broken by substitute Stones, who swept in from close range in the final moments to make it 48 home games without defeat for City.
“Obviously, it is already a miracle we played 56 minutes at the Etihad with 10 men. It is unbelievable what we have done,” said Arteta, who was incensed when Trossard was shown a second yellow card for kicking the ball away.


“I’m expecting 100 Premier League games this season to play 10 against 11 or 10 against 10 or nine against 10, let’s see,” Arteta said.
City was defending an unbeaten home run dating back to a 2-1 loss to Brentford in November 2022. Arsenal was within moments of its first victory at City since 2015 after Gabriel Magalhaes’ first-half header had put the visitors 2-1 up. 
Stones’ late leveler was in keeping with a game packed with intrigue and incident. 
Erling Haaland reached a landmark when putting City ahead in the ninth with his 100th goal for the club in 105 appearances — firing past Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya.
That later felt like an aside as the home fans began to resign themselves to a rare defeat on home soil. 
Influential City midfielder Rodri had left the field in the 20th after appearing to hurt his right knee. The Spain international limped off and his departure proved a turning point as Arsenal leveled just two minutes later through Riccardo Calafiori’s curling effort from outside the area. 
Magalhaes then headed the visitors in front from a corner in the first minute of first-half stoppage time, having come close from an almost identical routine shortly before. 
There was still time for another pivotal moment before the break when Trossard was sent off. 
With a numerical advantage, City dominated the second half but looked like being frustrated by Arsenal’s stubborn defense and some impressive saves from Raya. 
Stones, a center back who sometimes operates in midfield, was brought on and Guardiola instructed him to join Haaland in attack. 
“He wanted me to play closer to Erling, get higher up the pitch so when we got crosses in we could start to win more aerial duels,” Stones said. 
It paid off. 
“Over the years we have learned as a team to stick together, no matter who is playing and to always be ready,” Stones added.
The draw ended City’s 100% winning record in the league season, but left it a point ahead of second-place Liverpool and Aston Villa in third. 
Arsenal is two points off the leader in fourth.
Arteta said his players were “really gutted” in the locker room after seeing victory snatched away so late. 
“But, as well, they know that they have made another big step today,” he said.
Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler and Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espírito Santo were sent off in a bad-tempered end to their teams’ 2-2 draw. 
The dismissals were triggered by Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White being shown a second yellow card in the 83rd at Amex Stadium for a reckless challenge on Joao Pedro. 
That sparked angry reactions on the sidelines, with Espirito Santo and Hurzeler both shown red by referee Robert Jones for what the Premier League described as “unacceptable technical area behavior.”
Forest stunned Liverpool with a 1-0 win at Anfield last weekend and it took the lead Sunday through Chris Wood’s penalty in the 13th minute. Jack Hinshelwood and Danny Welbeck gave Brighton a halftime lead with goals in the 42nd and 45th. Ramon Sosa leveled the game in the 70th.

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — El Salvador’s military says the national police director, other high-ranking police officials and a fugitive banker were among nine people killed in a military helicopter crash in a rural part of the country.
The cause of the crash on Sunday night is under investigation. It occurred after the banker, Manuel Coto, was captured in Honduras over the weekend and handed over to Salvadoran authorities at the border.
Coto, the former manager of the COSAVI savings and loan cooperative, had been the subject of an Interpol arrest warrant and one of 32 people implicated in the embezzlement of more than $35 million by the cooperative’s directors and employees.
El Salvador’s military in a post on X said the air force helicopter crash occurred in the area of San Eduardo, Pasaquina, La Union. It said the director general of the National Civil Police, Mauricio Arriaza Chicas, and two deputies were aboard.
El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele said in a post on X that “what happened cannot remain as a simple ‘accident’” and must be investigated thoroughly “and to the ultimate consequences. We will request international help.”
Bukele noted that Arriaza Chicas had led the government’s fight against the gangs that once dominated daily life for much of the Salvadoran population. Bukele’s harsh crackdown on the gangs and mass arrests of more than 80,000 people with little due process have been condemned by human rights organizations. 


Security specialist Luis Contreras, said it was unlikely Arriaza Chicas’ death would negatively impact the war against the gangs, which the government claims it has all but eliminated.
“In El Salvador there are many experienced people and police commissioners who could replace the late director,” Contreras said.
Contreras maintained that the gangs no longer have the capacity to react. “Crime is not eliminated, but rather neutralized,” he said. “The neutralization El Salvador’s government has achieved against the gangs has been almost 90%.”
Bukele ordered flags to fly at half-staff Monday in remembrance of Arriaza Chicas, whom he described as a “national hero.”
“All flags, throughout the national territory, as well as in our embassies and consulates, will fly at half-staff for three days in honor of the director of the National Civil Police,” Bukele said on X.
Meanwhile, the bodies of the victims were taken to the capital in a caravan guarded by police.",False

HOUSTON (AP) — Mitch Garver and Julio Rodríguez homered, and the Seattle Mariners took advantage of five Houston errors during an 8-1 victory over the Astros on Wednesday.
Seattle (82-77) won for the fifth time in seven games as it tries to rally into an AL wild card. It is chasing Detroit and Kansas City for one of the last two spots.
“We’ve got three now to go and we just keep grinding,” manager Dan Wilson said. “We’ve got everything right in front of us. Three games that we have to win and probably have to get some help along the way, too. But we’ve just got to do what we do and not worry about anything else.”
The Mariners were down 1-0 before rallying in the sixth. Dylan Moore reached on the first of four errors by rookie third baseman Shay Whitcomb, who entered in the fourth. Victor Robles walked and Cal Raleigh hit a one-out single to load the bases.
Justin Turner then extended his on-base streak to 20 consecutive games with his single on a line drive to left field that scored two.
Garver opened the seventh with his 14th homer on a line drive into the seats in left field. The Mariners added two more runs in the inning thanks to three errors by the Astros, including two more by Whitcomb.
“Offensively we had some breaks later, we took advantage of some of their miscues,” Wilson said. “We were able to keep adding on later in the game.”
A fourth error by Whitcomb allowed Moore to reach with no outs in the ninth, and he scored on a double by Robles. Rodríguez then hit his 20th homer of the season.


“I’ll have a conversation with (Whitcomb) but we’ll turn the page,” Astros manager Joe Espada said. “This is a sure-handed third baseman. He’s done it in the minor leagues.”
Yusei Kikuchi (9-10) struck out eight in six innings in his first loss with Houston. He was charged with two unearned runs and four hits.
The Astros won Kikuchi’s first nine starts after he was acquired in a July 29 trade with Toronto. He went 5-0 with a 3.00 ERA during that stretch.
George Kirby (14-11) pitched six innings of four-hit ball in his third consecutive win for Seattle. He struck out six and walked one.
Victor Caratini hit an RBI single in the third for the Astros, who played without many of their regulars a day after clinching their fourth straight AL West title.
There was a special moment for Alex Bregman in the fourth inning of what could be his final regular-season home game at Minute Maid Park. He is eligible for free agency after this season.
Bregman trotted out to third base, but Espada lifted him for a defensive replacement before the inning started. Bregman slowly walked to the dugout as he received a standing ovation. He paused before entering the dugout and tipped his cap to the crowd.
He admitted that the moment got to him. 
“A little bit,” he said. “But I’m trying to just stay focused on the postseason, to be honest with you. Maybe at the end of the year we’ll be able to look back and reflect on it, but right now my mindset is win.” 
Selected by Houston with the No. 2 pick in the 2015 amateur draft, Bregman has spent his entire career with the Astros.
Astros: OF/DH Yordan Alvarez will not travel with the team on its upcoming road trip, instead staying in Houston to receive treatment on his sprained right knee. Espada said Alvarez had improved Wednesday and that some of the swelling had subsided since he was injured on a slide Sunday.
Mariners: Open a three-game series against the Athletics on Friday night in Seattle.
Astros: Traveling to Cleveland for a three-game series starting Friday night.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Chicago Cubs claimed right-handed reliever Enoli Paredes off waivers from the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday.
Paredes, who turns 29 on Saturday, went 1-0 with a 1.74 ERA and one save in 17 relief appearances with the Brewers. He dealt with a right forearm issue earlier this season that caused him to spend over two months on the injured list.
The Cubs also recalled right-handers Gavin Hollowell and Caleb Kilian from Triple-A Iowa before the opener of a three-game series at Philadelphia. Right-hander Jorge López was placed on the 15-day injured list with a right groin strain, and right-hander Trey Wingenter was optioned to the Arizona Complex League.
The 31-year-old López signed with Chicago after he was released by the New York Mets in June. He is 1-1 with a 2.03 ERA and two saves in 24 appearances with the Cubs.
The Brewers designated Paredes for assignment Friday when they called up right-hander Kevin Herget from Triple-A Nashville.
Paredes has a 4-3 record with a 3.06 ERA, 51 strikeouts, one save and 41 walks over 53 innings in 54 career major league appearances, all in relief. He pitched for the Houston Astros from 2020-22.
The Cubs had an opening on their 40-man roster after they designated right-hander Shawn Armstrong for assignment last week.

BEIJING (AP) — Carlos Alcaraz cruised past Tallon Griekspoor 6-1, 6-2 at the China Open for his 200th tour-level victory on Sunday.
The victory sent Alcaraz to the quarterfinals, and made him the third player born in this century to achieve the 200-win feat along with Jannik Sinner and Felix Auger-Aliassime.
“I’m really happy about it, 200 wins is a great number,” the 21-year-old Alcaraz said. 
“But I am already looking for the third hundred. I just want to keep going, to keep rolling. I am looking forward to playing matches and to keep doing the things that I am doing.”
In the women’s tournament, third-ranked Jessica Pegula responded to losing a marathon first set to rally for a 6-7 (9), 6-1, 6-2 win over Veronika Kudermetova in the third round. 
The No. 6-ranked Coco Gauff beat Katie Boulter 7-5, 6-2. Four-time major winner Naomi Osaka will now play Katie Volynets on Monday after heavy rain in the afternoon.
Pegula has won 17 of her last 19 matches, including defending her title in Toronto and making finals at Cincinnati and the U.S. Open, where her only defeats have come to Aryna Sabalenka, the top-seeded player in Beijing.
The American made three service breaks in the first set, but also lost three of her own, with Kudermetova prevailing in a lung-busting 20 point tiebreaker to take the lead.
The loss of the tiebreaker seemed to spur Pegula to life as she found her groundstroke range to break her Russian opponent’s serve twice in each set to take the match in just over 2 1/2 hours. It was Pegula’s first win against the 39th-ranked Kudermetova in three attempts. 


Pegula will play the 15th-seeded Paula Badosa in the fourth round after the Spaniard beat Rebecca Sramkova 7-5, 7-5. 
Poland’s Magdalena Frech, seeded 23rd, overcame a disastrous start to rally to a three-set win over 12th-seeded Diana Shnaider 0-6, 6-3, 6-4 and next faces the 595th-ranked wildcard Zhang Shuai, who beat Greet Minnen of Belgium 6-2, 6-3. 
In the men’s draw, local favorite Bu Yunchaokete upset Paris Olympics bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti 6-2, 6-4 for the 22-year-old’s first victory against a top 20-player. 
The 96th-ranked Bu will next play either fifth-seeded Andrey Rublev or Alejando Davidovich Fokina. 
Seventh-seeded Karen Khachanov made 15 fewer winners and four more unforced errors than Argentine Francisco Cerundolo, but found a way to win the big points in a 7-6 (4), 7-6 (9) victory to take him through to the quarterfinals and a matchup against Alcaraz.
Alcaraz needs to make at least the semifinals this week to rise above Alexander Zverev to No. 2 in the rankings. Zverev is not playing in Beijing as he recovers from an illness.
Sixth-seeded Holger Rune of Denmark beat home favorite Kei Nishikori 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the quarterfinals of the Japan Open, and Arthur Fils of France beat defending champion Ben Shelton 7-5, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (2).
Tomas Machac was the first man through to the semifinals in Tokyo with a 7-6 (2), 6-3 victory over American qualifier Alex Michelsen. Machac had eight aces and broke Michelsen’s serve twice as he advanced in 95 minutes.
Machac will play Ugo Humbert in the semifinals after the Frenchman won by walkover against Jack Draper of Britain. 
Humbert was leading Draper 7-5, 2-1 when the U.S. Open semifinalist retired from the match because he was unable to continue.

BetMGM College Football Odds: Oklahoma State by 7 1/2.
Series record: Arkansas leads 30-15-1.
Oklahoma State believes reaching the College Football Playoff is a possibility. A win over SEC member Arkansas couldn’t hurt. Oklahoma State is coming off a solid win over South Dakota State, the two-time defending FCS champion that entered the game on a 29-game win streak. Arkansas coach Sam Pittman has acknowledged that he is on the hot seat after a rough 2023 campaign. A road win over a ranked opponent would cool things down a bit and provide hope for restless Razorback fans.
Oklahoma State RB Ollie Gordon II vs. Arkansas run defense. Gordon won the Doak Walker Award for the nation’s top running back last season and was a first-team AP All-American. He ran for 104 yards on 27 carries in the season opener and scored three touchdowns — two rushing and one receiving. He faces an Arkansas defense that allowed seven yards rushing against UAPB.
Arkansas: QB Taylen Green. The transfer from Boise State passed for two touchdowns and ran for two in the opener. His mobility could create problems for an Oklahoma State defense that tends to be aggressive. He ran for 88 yards on six carries in the opener.
Oklahoma State: QB Alan Bowman. The seventh-year quarterback is the perfect compliment to Gordon. He sprays the ball all over the field and doesn’t try to do too much. He completed 25 of 34 passes for 265 yards and three touchdowns against South Dakota State.

Publication date:2024-09-25 20:06:00

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The mayor of a central Wisconsin city who ran for office on his opposition to absentee ballot drop boxes said Wednesday he did nothing wrong when he put on work gloves, donned a hard hat and used a dolly to cart away a drop box outside City Hall.
Wausau Mayor Doug Diny posed for a picture Sunday to memorialize his removal of the city’s lone drop box that had been put outside City Hall around the same time late last week that absentee ballots were sent to voters. The city’s election clerk, Kaitlyn Bernarde, said she has reported the issue to the Marathon County district attorney a well as the state elections commission.
“This is no different than the maintenance guy moving it out there,” Diny said Wednesday. “I’m a member of staff. There’s nothing nefarious going on here. I’m hoping for a good result.”
The move, which sparked a protest in the city Tuesday night and anger among drop box advocates, is the latest example in swing state Wisconsin of the fight over whether communities will allow absentee ballot drop boxes.
More than 60 towns, villages and cities in nine counties have opted out of using absentee ballot drop boxes for the presidential election in November, according to a tally by the group All Voting is Local. Drop boxes are being embraced in heavily Democratic cities including Milwaukee and Madison. Wisconsin has a total of 72 counties. 
Drop boxes were widely used in 2020, fueled by a dramatic increase in absentee voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 500 drop boxes were set up in more than 430 communities for the election that year, including more than a dozen each in Madison and Milwaukee. Drop boxes were used in 39 other states during the 2022 election, according to the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project.


After former President Donald Trump lost the state in 2020, he and Republicans alleged that drop boxes facilitated cheating, even though they offered no evidence. Democrats, election officials and some Republicans argued the boxes are secure.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court, then controlled by conservatives, banned the use of drop boxes in 2022.
But in July, the now-liberal controlled court reversed that decision and said drop boxes could be used. However, the court left it up to each community to decide whether to install them.
The Wisconsin Elections Commission, in guidance sent in July to all 1,800-plus clerks who administer elections in Wisconsin, said it was up to municipal clerks to determine the location of drop boxes.
Wausau, with about 40,000 people, was among the cities that did not use an absentee drop box in the August state primary. Wausau is located in Marathon County, which Trump won by 18 points in both 2016 and 2020.
Diny ran as a conservative and was backed by the Republican Party in the nonpartisan mayor’s race. He is in his first year as Wausau mayor after being elected in April.
Diny said that he and the city clerk never discussed the drop box before it was placed outside City Hall late last week. Diny said he decided Sunday to act when he realized the drop box was “not secure.”
Bernarde said Wednesday that the city planned to “secure the drop box to the ground” and unlock it, but it was removed before that could be done. The box was locked and contained no ballots, she said. Not a single absentee ballot had been returned to the city of Wausau as of Monday, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.
What to know about the 2024 Election
Diny said he wanted the city council to have a say in what happens with the drop box. Had the city council voted to put the drop box out, Diny said he wouldn’t have had the authority to remove it.
While Diny said he is generally opposed to drop boxes, he also said he’s not taking a position on whether it should be in place for the ballots that are in voters’ hands now and can be returned until Election Day.
“As it stands now, I don’t have a dog in the hunt,” Diny said. “I want it to be done properly and with the proper input and consent of citizens.”
It is a felony in Wisconsin to impede or prevent “the free exercise of the franchise at an election.” 
Marathon County District Attorney Theresa Wetzsteon did not return an email Wednesday seeking comment.
The U.S. Election Assistance Commission has a series of recommendations to ensure the safety of drop boxes not located inside buildings, including that they be under video surveillance, secured, in a well-lit area and a clear chain of custody is created for the retrieval of ballots. The Wausau drop box was under video surveillance but had not yet been bolted down.
Diny insisted he did nothing wrong. The city attorney, Anne Jacobson, did not return messages seeking comment Wednesday.
“If somebody would have put it in their pickup truck and drove it away, the police would be looking for them for theft of property,” Diny said. The drop box is safe inside City Hall while the issue is unresolved, he said.
Wausau resident Pamela Bannister, speaking at a city council meeting Tuesday night, called for Diny to apologize and return the drop box.
“This is the kind of action that’s designed to stir the pot,” Bannister said. “It does not tamp down the rhetoric that we’re all facing in this election cycle. It accomplishes nothing positive and amounts to, in my estimation, voting interference and intimidation.”",True

Publication date:2024-09-05 07:00:00

PARIS (AP) — President Emmanuel Macron named Michel Barnier as France’s new prime minister on Thursday, hoping the Brexit negotiator and veteran conservative can work with the country’s bitterly divided legislature to end political turmoil that has roiled Macron’s presidency.
Barnier, 73, is the oldest of the 26 prime ministers that have served modern France’s Fifth Republic. He replaces the youngest, Gabriel Attal, who was 34 when he was appointed just eight months ago. 
Attal was also France’s first openly gay prime minister. French media and some of Macron’s political opponents, who immediately criticized Barnier’s appointment, quickly dug up that, when serving in parliament in 1981, the new prime minister had been among 155 lawmakers who voted against a law that decriminalized homosexuality. 
Barnier’s appointment ends more than 50 days of a caretaker government in France, but offers no guarantee of a return to political calm. Barnier faces the tough task of having to work with the acrimonious and deeply split hung parliament that emerged from an early legislative election that Macron called in June.
At a handover ceremony with Attal, Barnier said that his new role would require “lots of listening, lots of respect.” 
Without a legislative majority of his own behind him, Barnier will need to find loose ad hoc groupings of backers in the National Assembly to tackle France’s pressing issues — including the budget for 2025. Macron and his aides spent weeks sounding out potential prime ministerial candidates, making calls and trying to build consensus, in the search for a government leader who might be able to survive in the fractured political landscape.


Barnier, a career politician proud of his humble roots in France’s Alpine region of Haute-Savoie, is no stranger to complex and daunting tasks: He was the European Union’s chief negotiator in the difficult talks with Britain over its departure from the bloc.
But he could quickly face possible attempts in parliament to topple the new government he will put together and lead. Opponents of Macron on the left of French politics immediately portrayed the appointment of the conservative Barnier as a slap in the face for those who voted for them in the legislative election. Macron hoped the voting would strengthen his position and provide clarity. Instead, the July 7 outcome saw his centrist government lose its majority but also produced no clear winner. 
By turning to Barnier, Macron is hoping to break the political deadlock. 
A statement from Macron’s office announcing the appointment said Barnier was tasked “with forming a unifying government to serve the country and the French people.”
“This appointment comes after an unprecedented cycle of consultations during which, in accordance with his constitutional duty, the president ensured that the prime minister and the future government would meet the conditions to be as stable as possible and give themselves the chances of uniting as broadly as possible,” the statement said.
Forming a government that isn’t quickly toppled by a parliamentary censure vote is sure to be a delicate tightrope act with a legislature so divided. To build the support his government will need, Barnier could possibly offer ministerial posts to potential allies.
“He will seek to build a government of national union, casting a wide net,” said Christophe Boutin, a political analyst at the University of Caen Normandie, 
But Barnier will also have to make do “without the extremes,” Boutin added, referring to Macron’s fiercest opponents on the far-left and far-right of French politics that have considerable sway but no majority in the legislature.
Barnier brings ample experience and networks of contacts from his political career of more than 50 years. He has served as ministers for foreign and European affairs as well as the environment and agriculture — and twice as a European commissioner. 
But his profile could also leave Macron open to opponents’ accusations that the president is not effecting the deep change that some voters hoped for from the legislative elections.
“Taking all this time to end up with Barnier, it doesn’t give the impression of a major revolution,” Boutin said. “Barnier has been in the political landscape for centuries.”
So political instability wouldn’t overshadow the July 26-Aug. 11 Paris Olympics, when France was in the global spotlight, Macron had kept Attal and his ministers on in a caretaker capacity, handling day-to-day affairs, after the prime minister resigned July 16, in the wake of the legislative defeat.
Influential far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon on Thursday immediately came out against Barnier’s appointment and predicted the prime minister would not get majority backing from lawmakers. 
Melenchon said the appointment flew in the face of the election results that left parliament’s lower house split between three main blocs — the left, including Melenchon’s party; the center where Macron has based his support, and the far right, converging around anti-immigration leader Marine Le Pen.
“The election has been stolen,” Melenchon asserted.
Le Pen, on the other hand, indicated that she’s willing to give Barnier a chance but said her National Rally party won’t take part in his government.
She said the 2025 budget will be a priority. Barnier’s government faces a tight deadline to deliver one. France is also under pressure from the EU to get its finances in order, with Brussels having rebuked Paris for running up excessive debt.
Barnier is “a man respectful of other political forces,” Le Pen said. “It’s important because compromises will have to be reached, considering the state of France’s budget.”",False

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Francisco Lindor homered and drove in two runs, David Peterson pitched seven brilliant innings and the New York Mets moved within one win of a playoff berth Sunday with a 5-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.
Francisco Alvarez also had two RBIs for the Mets, who headed to Atlanta needing at least a doubleheader split Monday against the rival Braves to secure a National League wild card.
“We have a chance. We get to play and we need one more (win). We feel good,” manager Carlos Mendoza said. “Nobody expected us to be in this position and here we are with a chance to do something special.”
New York could have clinched a postseason spot Sunday with a win and an Arizona loss, but the Diamondbacks routed San Diego 11-2 at home to complete their regular season.
The afternoon twinbill in Atlanta was scheduled to make up two Mets-Braves games postponed on Wednesday and Thursday due to heavy rain from Hurricane Helene. New York holds a potential tiebreaker over the Diamondbacks after winning the season series 4-3, so the Mets can reach the playoffs by sweeping or splitting the doubleheader.
Arizona (89-73) needs a sweep by either the Braves (88-72) or Mets (88-72) to advance.
If the Mets and Braves split, New York would get the No. 6 seed in the NL playoff bracket and return to Milwaukee for a best-of-three Wild Card Series against the NL Central champion Brewers.


A doubleheader sweep would earn the Mets the No. 5 seed and send them to San Diego, while Arizona would take the No. 6 seed and play at Milwaukee.
A sweep by the Braves would eliminate New York, while a sweep by the Mets would knock out Atlanta.
The Braves get the No. 5 seed with a split or a sweep. 
All the first-round series begin Tuesday, and designated hitter J.D. Martinez thinks Monday’s makeup doubleheader leaves the Mets at a disadvantage without a potential off day afterward. 
“I wish MLB would push the playoffs back a little bit. I think it’s an unfair advantage to the team we’re going to play,” Martinez said. “We know what’s on the line and are going to scratch to win those games and then have to turn around and get on a flight after. It’s going to be a tough task. We’ve just got to suck it up and find a way to get through it.”
New York won for just the second time in its last 14 meetings with Milwaukee and finished 1-5 this season against the Brewers.
Peterson (10-3) permitted only a first-inning infield single. He struck out eight and walked three.
“He threw the ball really well and stayed on the attack,” Mendoza said. “He was calm and under control and he kept making good pitches.”
Edwin Díaz needed 26 pitches in the ninth to nail down New York’s ninth shutout of the year — all since July 11. 
The Mets grabbed a quick lead in the first against Colin Rea (12-6) when Lindor walked, stole second base and scored on Brandon Nimmo’s single. Lindor played in the field after serving as DH on Saturday. The star shortstop returned to the lineup Friday after being sidelined for nearly two weeks with lower back pain. 
When asked if he’d be able to play 18 innings at shortstop on Monday, Lindor said: “I would love to. We’ll see where I’m at.”
Jose Iglesias led off the third with a single to extend his hitting streak to 20 games, the longest by a Mets player this season.
Martinez snapped a career-worst 0-for-36 slump with a leadoff double in the fourth and scored on Alvarez’s single. Lindor’s run-scoring single later in the inning made it 3-0 and led to chants of “MVP! MVP!” from a vocal group of fans seated behind the New York dugout. Mets owner Steve Cohen was among those in the area. Lindor then stole his second base of the game.
Alvarez’s sacrifice fly in the fifth pushed it to 4-0 and the Mets tacked on another run when Lindor belted his 32nd homer leading off the sixth.
Peterson threw 95 pitches and rebounded from a short outing in his previous start on Sept. 20.
“We’ve been playing important games for a long time now and we understand the magnitude of what these games hold for us,” Peterson said. 
Milwaukee finished the regular season 93-69, the 11th season in franchise history with 90 or more wins, which follows a 92-70 mark last year.
“We can’t worry too much about who we’re going to play,” manager Pat Murphy said. “We’re going to face one of the best teams in baseball, whoever it is.”
In perhaps his final regular-season home game with the Brewers, shortstop Willy Adames was replaced in the field in the seventh and left to a standing ovation.
Milwaukee drew 33,754 fans for its regular-season finale at American Family Field to reach total attendance of 2,537,202 for the season, a slight drop from 2,551,347 last year.
Mets: Alvarez returned to the starting lineup after back spasms caused him to leave an 8-4 loss Friday night. He struck out in a pinch-hitting appearance Saturday. Alvarez exited late in Sunday’s game after experiencing what he described as cramping in his right hamstring. 
Mets: Tylor Megill is scheduled to start the opener Monday, with Luis Severino lined up for Game 2. But if the Mets win the first game, they’d likely save Severino for Game 1 of a Wild Card Series on Tuesday.
Brewers: Will host the Mets or Diamondbacks in Game 1 of a Wild Card Series on Tuesday.

Publication date:2024-09-09 07:00:00

CHICAGO (AP) — Joey Cantillo pitched seven sparkling innings for his first major league win, and the Cleveland Guardians beat the Chicago White Sox 5-3 on Monday night.
Cantillo was working on a perfect game before Andrew Benintendi grounded a single into right field with two outs in the seventh. Benintendi advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Andrew Vaughn’s single, but Korey Lee bounced to third for the final out of the inning.
Cantillo (1-3) struck out a career-high 10 in his fifth start and sixth major league appearance overall. The 24-year-old left-hander, recalled from Triple-A Columbus earlier in the day, stepped into the rotation after Alex Cobb was scratched Saturday because of a blister.
“That was a beautifully pitched game,” Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said.
Asked if the seventh was Cantillo’s last inning no matter what, a grinning Vogt played it coy.
“Let’s just say I was not too upset that the hit happened,” he said. “Yeah, I mean you get to that point in the game and we have to think of his health, we have to think of the rest of the season.”
David Fry and Bo Naylor homered for Cleveland, and Steven Kwan reached three times from the leadoff spot and scored two runs.
The Guardians increased their AL Central lead to 3 1/2 games over second-place Kansas City, which lost 10-4 to the New York Yankees.
“It means a lot,” Cantillo said of his first win. “I mean, a little weight lifted off, I guess. ... We know how important that is to just get that win. A team win.” 


It was a franchise-record 13th consecutive home loss and No. 15 in 17 games overall for the lowly White Sox. At 33-112, they are approaching the majors’ modern record for most losses — 120 by the 1962 New York Mets in their inaugural season.
Bryan Ramos hit his first big league homer for Chicago in the eighth, a two-run drive off Nick Sandlin. Emmanuel Clase handled the ninth for his 43rd save in 46 opportunities.
“I was looking at the score a couple of times and I say, ‘What’s going on? Come on, guys. I know we can do it,’” Ramos said. “Finally Benny got a hit. After that, the team kind of got going.” 
Fry lifted Cleveland to a 3-0 lead when he hit a solo drive off Jared Shuster (1-4) in the third. Naylor went deep against Enyel De Los Santos in the fourth.
It was the 14th homer of the season for Fry and No. 12 for Naylor.
“Our guys had great at-bats for the majority of the night,” Vogt said.
Chicago dropped to 5-23 since Grady Sizemore took over as interim manager on Aug. 8, replacing Pedro Grifol. Sizemore, 42, was a three-time All-Star outfielder while spending the first eight years of his playing career with Cleveland.
“I have nothing but good memories from my time there,” Sizemore said before the game. “I guess it’s always a little exciting and a little motivation when you’re playing your old team, but just trying to focus on our guys really and just put together another good series.” 
White Sox: 3B Yoán Moncada (left adductor strain) is going to continue with his rehab stint with Triple-A Charlotte for now. “He’s been responding well, but at this point, we want to continue to make sure he’s in a good spot and he feels good about where his body’s at before we make a decision on bringing him back,” general manager Chris Getz said.
Jonathan Cannon (3-9, 4.53 ERA) starts for Chicago on Tuesday night. The rookie right-hander pitched 5 2/3 innings of one-run ball in an 8-1 victory at Baltimore on Wednesday. Cleveland had not announced its starter.

Follow AP’s live coverage of Helene and the 2024 hurricane season.
CRAWFORDVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Helene made landfall Thursday night in northwestern Florida as a Category 4 storm as forecasters warned that the enormous system could create a “nightmare” storm surge and bring dangerous winds and rain across much of the southeastern U.S.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Helene roared ashore around 11:10 p.m. EDT near the mouth of the Aucilla River in the Big Bend area of Florida’s Gulf Coast. It had maximum sustained winds estimated at 140 mph ( 225 kph). That location was only about 20 miles northwest of where Hurricane Idalia came ashore last year at nearly the same ferocity and caused widespread damage.
Helene prompted hurricane and flash flood warnings extending far beyond the coast up into northern Georgia and western North Carolina. More than a million homes and businesses were without power in Florida and more than 50,000 in Georgia, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. The governors of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas and Virginia all declared emergencies in their states.
One person was killed in Florida when a sign fell on their car and two people were reported killed in a possible tornado in south Georgia as the storm approached.
“When Floridians wake up tomorrow morning, we’re going to be waking up to a state where very likely there’s been additional loss of life and certainly there’s going to be loss of property,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news conference Thursday night.


The National Weather Service in Tallahassee had issued an “extreme wind warning” for the Big Bend as the eyewall approached: “Treat this warning like a tornado warning,” it said in a post on X. “Take shelter in the most interior room and hunker down!” 


Even before landfall the storm’s wrath was felt widely, with sustained tropical storm-force winds and hurricane-force gusts along Florida’s west coast. Water lapped over a road in Siesta Key near Sarasota and covered some intersections in St. Pete Beach. Lumber and other debris from a fire in Cedar Key a week ago crashed ashore in the rising water. 
Beyond Florida, up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain had fallen in the North Carolina mountains, with up to 14 inches (36 centimeters) more possible before the deluge ends, setting the stage for flooding that forecasters warned could be worse than anything seen in the past century. 
Heavy rains began falling and winds were picking up earlier Thursday in Valdosta, Georgia, near the Florida state line. The weather service said more than a dozen Georgia counties could see hurricane-force winds exceeding 110 mph (177 kph).
In south Georgia, two people were killed when a possible tornado struck a mobile home on Thursday night, Wheeler County Sheriff Randy Rigdon told WMAZ-TV. The damage was reported as heavy thunderstorms raked much of the state. Wheeler County is about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Macon.
Forecaster Dylan Lusk said the National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for Wheeler County at 8:47 p.m. on Thursday. He said it’s one of 12 tornado warnings the office near Atlanta issued for parts of Georgia between 1 p.m. and 11 p.m.
The storm made landfall in the sparsely-populated Big Bend area, home to fishing villages and vacation hideaways where Florida’s Panhandle and peninsula meet. 
“Please write your name, birthday, and important information on your arm or leg in a PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,” the sheriff’s office in mostly rural Taylor County warned those who chose not to evacuate in a Facebook post, the dire advice similar to what other officials have dolled out during past hurricanes. 
Still, Philip Tooke, a commercial fisherman who took over the business his father founded near the region’s Apalachee Bay, planned to ride out this storm like he did during Hurricane Michael and the others – on his boat. “If I lose that, I don’t have anything,” Tooke said. Michael, a Category 5 storm, all but destroyed one town, fractured thousands of homes and businesses and caused some $25 billion in damage when it struck the Florida Panhandle in 2018. 
Many, though, were heeding the mandatory evacuation orders that stretched from the Panhandle south along the Gulf Coast in low-lying areas around Tallahassee, Gainesville, Cedar Key, Lake City, Tampa and Sarasota. 
Among them was Sharonda Davis, one of several gathered at a Tallahassee shelter worried their mobile homes wouldn’t withstand the winds. She said the hurricane’s size is “scarier than anything because it’s the aftermath that we’re going to have to face.”
Federal authorities were staging search-and-rescue teams as the weather service forecast storm surges of up to 20 feet (6 meters) and warned they could be particularly “catastrophic and unsurvivable” in Apalachee Bay.
“Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!” the office said, describing the surge scenario as “a nightmare.”
Preparing for a hurricaneJaime Hernandez, the emergency management director for Hollywood, on Florida’s Atlantic Coast, says his team encourages people to do three key things: make a plan, have an emergency kit and stay informed.
Preparing for a hurricane also includes getting supplies in advance, including nonperishable foods and water in case power is lost and supplies are low in the community. Preparedness also includes ensuring all medical items and medications are ready in case people are unable to leave their homes.
Emergency kit necessitiesThe rule of thumb is to have 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water per day per person for about seven days, Hernandez says. It’s also a good idea to have cash on hand since ATMs may not be working.
Evacuating ahead of a stormOfficials advise residents listen to their local emergency management officials, who will have the most updated information about evacuation zones.
These excerpts were originally published on July 2, 2024, in Hurricane season 2024 is here. Here’s how to stay prepared. 
This stretch of Florida known as the Forgotten Coast has been largely spared by the widespread condo development and commercialization that dominates so many of Florida’s beach communities. The region is loved for its natural wonders — the vast stretches of salt marshes, tidal pools and barrier islands.
“You live down here, you run the risk of losing everything to a bad storm,” said Anthony Godwin, 20, who lives about a half-mile (800 meters) from the water in the coastal town of Panacea, as he stopped for gas before heading west toward his sister’s house in Pensacola.
School districts and multiple universities canceled classes. Airports in Tampa, Tallahassee and Clearwater were closed Thursday, while cancellations were widespread elsewhere in Florida and beyond.
While Helene will likely weaken as it moves inland, damaging winds and heavy rain were expected to extend to the southern Appalachian Mountains, where landslides were possible, forecasters said. The hurricane center warned that much of the region could experience prolonged power outages and flooding. Tennessee was among the states expected to get drenched.
Helene had swamped parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday, flooding streets and toppling trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort city of Cancun. In western Cuba, Helene knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses as it brushed past the island. 
Areas 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Georgia-Florida line expected hurricane conditions. The state opened its parks to evacuees and their pets, including horses. Overnight curfews were imposed in many cities and counties in south Georgia.
“This is one of the biggest storms we’ve ever had,” said Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.
Rain and wind are expected to increase Thursday along coastal Florida’s Big Bend region as Hurricane Helene approaches
For Atlanta, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd.
Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.
In storm activity in the Pacific, former Hurricane John reformed Wednesday as a tropical storm and strengthened Thursday back into a hurricane as it threatened areas of Mexico’s western coast with flash flooding and mudslides. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador raised John’s death toll to five as communities along the country’s Pacific coast prepared for the storm to make a second landfall.

Publication date:2024-09-30 00:58:00

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Kyler Murray only had a few moments to look downfield early in the third quarter before he was mauled by Washington’s Bobby Wagner and Daron Payne, taking another sack during a miserable day for the Arizona Cardinals.
One ineffective play later, the quarterback trudged off the field as boos rained down from the home crowd.
Arizona’s rebuild took a step backward in a demoralizing 42-14 loss to the Commanders on Sunday. The Cardinals (1-3) jumped to an early 7-0 lead, but were outplayed in virtually every facet for the next 3 1/2 quarters.
“Something’s got to change,” Murray said. “We weren’t good enough today. They exploited our weaknesses, we didn’t play complimentary football. Every phase of the game, we’ve got to be better. That wasn’t the type of football we want to play.”
Murray connected with rookie Marvin Harrison Jr. for a 2-yard touchdown on the opening drive, but Washington responded with two straight touchdowns and Arizona wasn’t able to answer before it was too late. 
One reason the Cardinals’ offense stalled was that Harrison basically disappeared for the second and third quarters. He finished with five catches for 45 yards.
“We’ve got to get our best players the ball,” Murray said. “When we’re doing good, you feel that.”
Murray completed 16 of 22 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown. James Conner had a 6-yard touchdown run to cut the Commanders’ lead to 27-14 late in the third quarter, which briefly made things competitive, but the Commanders responded with another touchdown drive, capped by a 10-yard throw from rookie Jayden Daniels to Terry McLaurin.


Arizona’s defense had few answers to stop Daniels, the rookie who has dazzled the NFL through four games. He completed 26 of 30 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown, and also ran 9 yards for a touchdown.

The Commanders ran for 216 yards, controlling the line of scrimmage from the outset.
“We haven’t done a good enough job stopping the run,” Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said. “We’re playing behind the 8-ball on defense all day and it’s a hard way to go. Give those guys credit, that’s a good offense. They’re well coached and made a bunch of plays.”
Gannon is in the second season leading the Cardinals’ rebuild and this was one of the first true stinkers of his tenure. Even after losing games to the Bills and Lions over the first three weeks, players and coaches were generally excited about how they competed against two of the NFL’s better teams.
There weren’t very many silver linings to take from Sunday.
“That was the first time we’ve been beat like that,” Gannon said. “If you keep doing the same thing, you’re asking for the same result. We’re very process driven and I trust our process, but everyone’s going to have to take a good, hard look, point the thumb at themselves, starting with me, and we’ve got to make some adjustments.”
The Cardinals have a 4-8 record since Murray — a two-time Pro Bowl selection — returned from a knee injury in the middle of last season. 
“It’s one game, the season’s not over,” Murray said. “We’ve just got to look in the mirror and get better. That’s what it comes down to because nobody’s panicking. We just got beat.”

John Tortorella had a former hockey coach help him Monday at Philadelphia Flyers training camp — the father of the late John and Matthew Gaudreau, who was an invited guest.
The Flyers tapped their sticks in appreciation of Guy Gaudreau, a former hockey coach at Hollydell Ice Arena and Gloucester Catholic High School in New Jersey, when he hit the ice to assist with drills during practice. The Flyers shook Gaudreau’s hand at the end of the skate in appreciation and thanked him for helping out.
“He was hesitant at first, and we kind of let him go at his timetable,” Tortorella said. “I think it worked out really well today. I gave him my camp book. We’re going to check in next week and see if we can get him out here a couple more times and have him be part of it. I don’t want it to be, ‘Just come out here.’ I want him to be part of it. I think it will be therapeutic for him to be around us and run some drills.”
Tortorella said he had never met Gaudreau, a former hockey player and coach who raised his family nearby, until Monday’s practice in New Jersey. Tortorella said Gaudreau had an open invitation to return and help the Flyers at any point.
“I never met Johnny and Matt in my travels as coach,” Tortorella told reporters at the Flyers’ complex in Voorhees. “But their family’s here. Horrific situation going on. He’s a coach. He’s done some great work with some of the youth out here. I figured it’s perfect just to get him in with us.”


Tortorella joked that Gaudreau was giving him a hard time for yelling at players to skate harder during practice.
“A lot of people know him in the organization because of his reputation,” Tortorella said.
Tortorella attended the brothers’ funeral last month in a Philadelphia suburb.
“I thought the two wives were so strong in how they handled themselves,” Tortorella said. “No one can imagine. No one can. I’m hoping to get to know the family. I think a number of coaches want to get to know the family, the girls, Matt’s family. It’s just horrible what happened. It’s still pretty fresh. It’s here. It’s with us. Down the street. We just want to be part of it and try and help.”
John Gaudreau’s widow, Meredith, wrote on social media how much Tortorella’s gesture meant to the family.
“John & Matty would love this. They’re both so proud of their dad, I know this made them smile as they watched down from heaven,” she wrote, adding a heart emoji.
John Gaudreau, the Columbus Blue Jackets star, and his brother, Matthew, were killed on Aug. 29 when police said they were struck by a suspected drunken driver while they were riding bicycles on a rural road in South Jersey on the eve of their sister Katie’s wedding. The driver who police say struck them is charged with two counts of death by auto, along with reckless driving, possession of an open container and consuming alcohol in a motor vehicle.
John Gaudreau, known as “Johnny Hockey,” played 10 full seasons in the league and was set to enter his third with the Blue Jackets after signing a seven-year, $68 million deal in 2022. He played his first eight seasons with the Calgary Flames, a tenure that included becoming one of the sport’s top players and a fan favorite across North America.
“We don’t want it to be an everyday story,” Tortorella said. “We just want to help. To be in a locker room, coach to coach, player to coach, guys talking to him, I just hope it helps a little bit.”

Publication date:2024-09-28 15:47:00

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — The Miami Dolphins will turn to Tyler “Snoop” Huntley at quarterback when they face the Tennessee Titans on Monday night.
With backup Skylar Thompson nursing a rib injury suffered last Sunday at Seattle, Huntley and Tim Boyle were Miami’s options for Week 4. Tua Tagovailoa remains out with a concussion.
Coach Mike McDaniel said the decision to go with Huntley came down to the quarterback’s experience and his teammates’ positive response to him since he arrived in Miami. The Dolphins signed him off the Ravens’ practice squad on Sept. 17.
“Snoop has started multiple and many big games,” McDaniel said Saturday. “As a quarterback, just understanding exactly what is required to win over teammates to take the place of somebody else and be able to assert their own personality, their own skill set, their own traits within the offense and lead people.”
Huntley was named to the Pro Bowl in 2022 after helping lead Baltimore to the playoffs in place of an injured Lamar Jackson. He has a 64.6% career completion percentage and gives the Dolphins depth as a runner.
It will be a homecoming for Huntley, who grew up in South Florida but went to college in Utah before spending the first four seasons of his career mostly in Baltimore.
“That’s just a child’s dream,” Huntley said this week. “Being able to play for your home team, man, that’s just something everybody doesn’t get to come across.”
Boyle will be Huntley’s backup on Monday.

DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Red Wings signed forward Lucas Raymond to an eight-year, $64.6 million contract Monday, completing a deal with one of their best young players less than 72 hours before training camp begins.
Raymond will count $8.075 million against the salary cap through 2032. The 22-year-old was a restricted free agent without a contract for the upcoming NHL season and was coming off setting career highs with 31 goals, 41 assists and 72 points.
The Red Wings have another one of those in defenseman Moritz Seider, who won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year in 2021-22.
Detroit is looking to end an eight-year playoff drought dating to the Original Six franchise’s last appearance in 2016.
Raymond, a Swede who was the fourth pick in 2020, has 174 points in 238 games since breaking into the league.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — The early season offensive struggles took another ugly turn for the Miami Dolphins on Monday night.
The Dolphins scored a late touchdown that snapped a nine-quarter touchdown drought in their 31-12 loss to the Tennessee Titans. The offensive misery continued as the Dolphins used their third quarterback since Tua Tagovailoa suffered a concussion in the second week home loss against Buffalo.
“There’s a tremendous disconnect between preparation and execution,” Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said. “There is a multitude of contributors I believe. The bottom line, it doesn’t matter what we’re doing behind the scenes. On the field that’s not even close to good enough.”
Miami, which has scored a league-low 45 points, finished with 184 yards total offense.
“It’s definitely frustrating. We’re definitely better than we show on game day,” Dolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle said. “We have to be better than good when your starting quarterback’s out.”
Tyler Huntley got the start against previously winless Tennessee but the problems persisted after last week’s 24-3 loss at Seattle, when Skylar Thompson and Tim Boyle took the snaps. Signed from the Baltimore Ravens’ practice squad on Sept. 17, Huntley completed 14 of 22 for 96 yards. He also ran for 40 yards on eight attempts.
Under Huntley, the Dolphins seemed out of sync. They were called for five illegal shift penalties, including three in one drive.


On a couple of big play opportunities with star receiver Tyreek Hill, Huntley mistimed passes after Hill had beaten his defender.
“You wished you had 1,000 reps to go through the playbook but it is what it is,” Huntley said. “I felt pretty comfortable but now I have to dig in deeper and know the ins and outs of the offense and take the offense to another level.”

With Huntley having joined the team two weeks ago, McDaniel acknowledged there were limitations and adjustment to the play-calling strategy.
“There are calculated decisions with what he was comfortable with from the previous game plan for Seattle and some stuff that he had done in his career,” McDaniel said. “It was abbreviated to the extent to all things he was comfortable with.”
The Titans also were pressed to use a backup quarterback when starter Will Levis sustained a right shoulder injury during a running play in the first quarter and Mason Rudolph took over.
Rudolph finished 9 of 17 for 85 yards and directed two touchdown-ending drives in the second half while helping rookie coach Brian Callahan get his first NFL win.
“He didn’t bat an eye when he walked in the game,” Callahan said. “Our guys didn’t bat an eye. He did exactly what you want a guy like that to do in that situation was come in and operate. He was pretty clean operation wise.”
The Dolphins’ defense limited the Titans to three field goals by Nick Folk before Tyjae Spears’ 7-yard run with six minutes remaining in the third quarter made it 16-6.
Tennessee secured the win when Tony Pollard scored from 4 yards with 2:03 remaining in the fourth quarter.
“There is nothing good about this situation right now in terms of where our team needs to be,” McDaniel said. “We need to do enough to win a football game against any opponent. Right now, that’s not the case and we need to fix that fast.”

Call it the dark arts. Call it anti-football. Call it doing whatever it takes to win.
Arsenal tried it all against Manchester City on Sunday in the latest chapter of the Premier League’s new heavyweight rivalry — and came within seconds of victory.
“There was only one team that came to play football,” Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva grumbled after an intense, absorbing and incident-packed 2-2 draw at Etihad Stadium. “The other came to play to the limits of what was possible to do and allowed by the referee, unfortunately.”
John Stones’ equalizer for City in the eighth minute of second-half stoppage time denied Arsenal, which played with 10 men for the entire second half, what would have been a defining victory for a team that is getting closer and closer to Pep Guardiola’s repeat champions.
City’s players know it, too.
Hence Bernardo’s outspoken post-match comments on Arsenal. Notice how Erling Haaland chucked the ball at the back of Arsenal defender Gabriel’s head in City’s wild celebrations after Stones’ late intervention. Look, too, at Pep Guardiola kicking his seat in the dugout after feeling a sense of injustice at the manner of Arsenal’s equalizer by Ricardo Calafiori.
Arsenal has gotten under City’s skin.
Roll on the return match at Emirates Stadium in early February.
“As a football match, it is a great spectacle for the Premier League,” City captain Kyle Walker said of the new rivalry with Arsenal, which has been runner-up in the last two seasons. “Probably not so much certain stuff — I think it’s part and parcel of the game and we’ll say the dark arts.”


Stones spoke of Arsenal’s attempts to slow the game down by what he perceived as feigning injuries to allow manager Mikel Arteta to “get some information on to the pitch.”
“I wouldn’t say they have mastered it but they have done it for a few years now so we knew to expect that,” Stones said. “You can call it clever or dirty, whichever way you want to put it, but they break up the game which upsets the rhythm.”
To that extent, Arteta looks to have taken a page out of former Chelsea and Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho’s playbook. Mourinho was, of course, once a huge rival of Guardiola’s and took cynical play to the extremes at times.
Arteta’s Arsenal can play beautiful football, as well. But with captain Martin Odegaard out injured and Leandro Trossard sent off against City in first-half stoppage time, the Gunners knew when it was time to change the approach to the other extreme.
“It’s unbelievable what we have done,” said Arteta, who knows City and Guardiola inside out having once been his fellow Spaniard’s assistant at the Etihad.
For Silva, matches against Liverpool — which was City’s big rival before Arsenal — were more enjoyable to play in.
“Liverpool always faced us face-to-face to try to win the games,” the Portugal playmaker said, “so by this perspective, the games against Arsenal haven’t been like the ones we had and have against Liverpool. So yes, maybe a different rivalry.”
Silva was one of many City players to get riled in what was an incendiary encounter pretty much from the start. At one stage, he curled his finger into a “0” as he faced up to Gabriel – seemingly in reference to Arsenal not winning any Premier League titles, at least since Silva joined City in 2017. Arsenal’s last league championship was in 2004.
Pressed on the difference between playing Liverpool and Arsenal, Silva said: “Maybe that Liverpool have already won a Premier League, Arsenal haven’t. That Liverpool have won a Champions League, Arsenal haven’t.”
Will this be the season that Arsenal ends its wait for the league title?
After five games, Arsenal sits in fourth place and two points behind City, the leader, having just emerged from visits to Tottenham and City — two of its toughest away games — in the space of a week with four points, either side of a 0-0 at Atalanta in the Champions League.
The stage could be a set for another City vs. Arsenal title race.

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — At least 30 bodies were found on a boat drifting off the coast of Senegal’s capital, the military said Monday, as the number of migrants leaving West Africa increases. 
The navy was informed of the vessel’s presence on Sunday evening and sent out a boat patrol to the area, 70 kilometers (38 nautical miles) from Dakar, Ibrahima Sow, spokesperson for Senegal’s military said in a statement.
“So far, 30 bodies have been counted,” Sow said.
The advanced state of decomposition of the bodies is making the identification process very difficult, the military said, adding that investigations will provide more information on the death toll and the boat’s origin.
Earlier this month, a boat carrying 89 people on board capsized off the coast of Senegal. At least 37 people died, according to Senegalese authorities.
Many of the migrants leaving West Africa through Senegal flee conflict, poverty and a lack of jobs. Most head to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the coast of West Africa, which is used as a stepping stone to continental Europe.
Since the beginning of the year, more than 22,300 people have landed on the Canary Islands, 126% more than the same period last year, according to statistics released by Spain’s Interior Ministry.
Last month, the Senegalese army said it had arrested 453 migrants and “members of smuggling networks” as part of a 12-day operation patrolling the coastline. More than half of those arrested were Senegalese nationals, the army said.


In July, a boat carrying 300 migrants, mostly from Gambia and Senegal, capsized off Mauritania. More than a dozen died and at least 150 others went missing.
The Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, the Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands this year alone.
Migrant vessels that get lost or run into problems often vanish in the Atlantic, with some drifting across the ocean for months until they are found in the Caribbean and Latin America carrying only human remains.

WESTBY, Wisconsin (AP) — President Joe Biden traveled to rural southwest Wisconsin on Thursday to champion new investments in electrification and expanded high-speed internet, proclaiming that “all these investments mean family farms can stay in the family.” 
In the town of Westby, Biden announced $7.3 billion in investments for 16 cooperatives that will provide electricity for millions of families in rural areas across 23 states, with the goal of lowering the cost of badly needed electricity connections in hard-to-reach areas. 
Funding for the project comes from the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022 and passed in Congress along party lines. The law invests roughly $13 billion in rural electrification across multiple programs and will create 4,500 permanent jobs and 16,000 construction jobs, according to the White House, which called the effort the largest investment in rural electrification since the New Deal in the 1930s. 
Biden also championed 2021’s infrastructure law, which was approved with some support from congressional Republicans and which he said had provided 72,000 additional Wisconsin homes and small businesses with high-speed internet. 
“Just like we’re making the most significant investment in rural electrification since FDR, we’re also making the most significant investment ever in affordable, high-speed internet because affordable high-speed internet is just as essential today as electricity was a century ago,” Biden said, referring to New Deal architect and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 


Biden said “all of these investments mean family farms can stay in the family, rural entrepreneurs can build their dreams, your children and grandchildren won’t have to leave home to make a living.” 
“That’s stopping now because we’re spreading opportunities to benefit everyone,” he added. 
Before talking policy, Biden addressed Wednesday’s school shooting in Georgia, where a 14-year-old student fatally shot four people. The president lamented that, during a back-to-school season that should have been a “joyous and exciting,” another community in America was instead left “absolutely shattered” by gun violence. 
Biden endorsed calls for stricter requirements for owners to lock up and better secure their firearms — leaning into the fact that he himself is a gun owner. 
“There are too many people who are able to access guns that shouldn’t be able to,” he said. “So let’s require safe storage of firearms. I know I’ve mine locked up.”
Biden also praised Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he endorsed after dropping his reelection bid in July. And he sharply criticized her opponent in November, former President Donald Trump, for failing to keep promises to spur public works and instead running up towering federal deficits by passing tax cuts that Biden argued primarily benefited the rich. 
“In thousands of cities and towns across the country and across Wisconsin, we’re seeing the great American comeback story,” Biden said, contrasting that with Trump and top Republicans who he said talk “about how bad off we are.” 
“Today’s announcement is about far more than just giving rural America the power to turn on the lights. It’s about giving the power to shape our own future,” Biden said. 
Democrats consider Wisconsin to be one of the must-win states in November’s presidential election between Trump and Harris. Biden won the state in 2020 by about 20,000 votes, flipping Wisconsin to the Democratic column after Trump narrowly won it in 2016.
Thursday was also personal for Biden, who returned to Wisconsin to revisit a promise he made early in his presidency to provide, among other infrastructure improvements, better internet to rural areas.
“It isn’t a luxury; it’s now a necessity, like water and electricity,” Biden said at the La Crosse Municipal Transit Utility in June 2021. White House deputy chief of staff Natalie Quillian said the latest visit means Biden has “delivered on so many of those promises.”

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary’s most popular opposition figure called for the resignation of one of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s closest aides on Thursday over statements he made suggesting that Hungary wouldn’t have defended itself against a Russian invasion, unlike Ukraine.
The aide, Balázs Orbán, who isn’t related to the prime minister, said on his podcast on Wednesday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had made an “irresponsible” decision by opting to militarily defend his country after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. 
He said that Hungary had learned from its anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 — which was eventually crushed by the Red Army, killing as many as 3,000 civilians and destroying much of the capital Budapest — that “precious Hungarian lives” must be treated with caution rather than “offering them up” for defense. 
“Every country has the right to decide its own destiny for itself,” Balázs Orbán said. “But based on ’56, we wouldn’t have done what President Zelenskyy did two and a half years ago, because that was irresponsible.”
The leader of Hungary’s strongest opposition party, Péter Magyar, wrote in a post on social media that the statement “humiliated the memory of the thousands of Hungarian freedom fighters, hundreds of whom — unlike Balázs Orbán — were willing to sacrifice their lives for the freedom and independence of their country.”
Balázs Orbán is the political director of the nationalist prime minister and one of his closest advisers. He has been instrumental in devising much of Hungary’s foreign and domestic strategy, and pursued close relationships with certain segments of the U.S. Republican Party that are aligned with former President Donald Trump.


His government has taken an adversarial position toward neighboring Ukraine, and sought to block, delay or water down European Union efforts to provide financial and military support to Kyiv and to pass sanctions on Moscow over its war in Ukraine.
Such efforts have led to accusations from many European leaders that Hungary is acting to divide the EU and advance Russian interests. 
Hungary’s Cold War-era anti-Soviet uprising looms large in the country’s consciousness as a symbol of its heroic struggle for independence and self determination. Some Hungarians view their government’s close ties to Russia today as a betrayal of the 1956 revolution’s efforts to force Soviet soldiers out of the country.
On Thursday, Magyar called for Balázs Orbán’s resignation by Oct. 23, the 68th anniversary of the revolution.
“Such a man cannot hold public office alongside the Hungarian Prime Minister,” Magyar wrote. 
In a video on Facebook later on Thursday, Orbán said that his words had been “twisted,” and blamed “pro-war propaganda” for seeking to involve Hungary in the war in Ukraine. 
“The heroes of 1956 are national heroes. Their memory is sacred and inviolable, and the heroes of 1956 were right and did the right thing,” he said. 
Hungary’s government has long advocated for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks for the war in Ukraine, but hasn’t outlined what that would mean for Ukraine’s territorial integrity or the future security of Europe and other NATO allies. 
Viktor Orbán angered EU leaders in July when he made unannounced visits to Russia and China on what he described as a “peace mission.” His meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin was the first by an EU leader in more than two years.",False

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Marxist politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake was sworn in as Sri Lanka’s president on Monday after an election that saw voters reject an old guard accused of leading the country into economic crisis.
Dissanayake, 55, who ran as head of the Marxist-leaning National People’s Power coalition, defeated President Ranil Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and 35 other candidates in Saturday’s election. 
The election came as the country seeks to recover from a severe economic crisis that led to shortages of essentials such as foods, medicines, cooking gas and fuel in 2022, triggering massive protests that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.
In a brief speech after the swearing-in, Dissanayake pledged to work with others to take on the country’s challenges.
AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on the swearing in of Sri Lanka’s new president.
“We have deeply understood that we are going to get a challenging country,” Dissanayake said. “We don’t believe that a government, a single party or an individual would be able to resolve this deep crisis.
He’s the ninth person to hold Sri Lanka’s powerful executive presidency, created in 1978 when a new constitution expanded the office’s powers.
However, Dayan Jayatilleka, a former diplomat and political analyst said Dissanayake could face challenges as the first president to enter office without a majority of the vote.
“It’s not an insurmountable obstacle,” said Jayatilleke, but said he will have to “engage as much as possible in politics of consensus.”


Dissanayake’s coalition is led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or People’s Liberation Front, a Marxist party that waged two unsuccessful armed insurrections in the 1970s and 1980s to capture power through socialist revolution. After its defeat, the JVP entered democratic politics in 1994 and has been mostly in opposition since then. However, they have supported several previous presidents and been part of governments briefly.
The NPP also includes groups representing academics, civil society movements, artists, lawyers and students.
Just before the swearing in, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena resigned, clearing the way for the new president to appoint a prime minister and a cabinet.
Chinese president Xi Jinping congratulated Dissanayake on his victory, saying on Monday that China looks forward to working together “to jointly carry forward our traditional friendship.” The U.S. and India previously congratulated Dissanayake.
Dissanayake was first elected to Parliament in 2000 and briefly held the portfolio of agriculture and irrigation minister under President Chandrika Kumaratunga. He ran for president for the first time in 2019 and lost to Rajapaksa.
Dissanayake’s first major challenge will be to act on his campaign promise to ease the crushing austerity measures imposed by his predecessor Wickremesinghe under a relief agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
Wickremesinghe has warned that any move to alter the basics of the agreement could delay the release of a fourth tranche of nearly $3 billion.
That economic crisis resulted from excessive borrowing to fund projects that did not generate revenue, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government’s insistence on using scarce foreign reserves to prop up its currency, the rupee.
Dissanayake has also vowed to dissolve parliament, where his party holds only three of 225 seats.",False

HONG KONG (AP) — A powerful typhoon made two landfalls in southern China Friday after it swept south of Hong Kong, bringing many aspects of life in the region to a halt and forcing about a million people in the country’s south to leave their homes. 
The Hainan province’s meteorological service said Yagi, which earlier packed winds of up to about 245 kph (152 mph) near its center, made landfall in the tropical vacation island’s Wenchang city at around 4:20 p.m.
China’s national meteorological authorities said Yagi was the strongest autumn typhoon to have landed in China. It made a second landfall in Xuwen County in neighboring Guangdong province on Friday night. 
Ahead of the afternoon landfall, nearly 420,000 residents were relocated in Hainan, and so were more than half a million people in Guangdong, state media said. 
The storm brought heavy rain across most of Hainan and some areas faced power outages. Strong winds buffeted the province’s iconic coconut trees. People built sandbag barriers outside buildings to guard against possible floods and reinforced their windows with tape, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported.
State media said classes, work, transportation and businesses had been suspended in parts of the province as early as Wednesday evening. Some tourist attractions were closed and all flights at three airports on the island were expected to be grounded on Friday. 
State broadcaster CCTV said Qinzhou city in Guangxi region also issued a top emergency response alert to guard against the typhoon. It said Yagi is expected to make another landfall somewhere between the region’s Fangchenggang city and the coastal area of northern Vietnam on Saturday afternoon. Beihai city suspended work, classes, businesses and transportation on Friday, local media said. 


Trading on the stock market, bank services and schools were halted in Hong Kong earlier Friday after the city’s weather authority raised a No. 8 typhoon signal for Yagi, the third-highest warning under the city’s weather system. 
Yagi forced more than 270 people to seek refuge at temporary government shelters and led to cancellations of more than 100 flights in the city. Nine people were injured and treated at hospitals. Heavy rain and strong winds felled dozens of trees. 
Yagi was a tropical storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 16 people dead and 17 others missing, mostly in landslides and widespread flooding, and affecting more than 2 million people in northern and central provinces.
More than 47,600 people were displaced from their homes in Philippine provinces, and classes, work, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were disrupted for days, including in the densely populated capital region, metropolitan Manila.

BREMEN, Germany (AP) — Michael Olise scored twice and Harry Kane scored his 10th club goal of the season as Bayern Munich brushed aside Werder Bremen 5-0 for its latest big win on Saturday.
Bayern has 20 goals in its last three games — of which Kane scored eight — after beating Holstein Kiel 6-1 last week and demolishing Dinamo Zagreb 9-2 in the Champions League on Tuesday.
Bayern’s sixth win in six games in all competitions under new coach Vincent Kompany comes ahead of playing Bundesliga champion Bayer Leverkusen next week. Bayern has 16 goals and three conceded from its four Bundesliga games.
Olise has made a bright start since arriving from Crystal Palace and has five goals and three assists in six games for Bayern in all competitions.
Despite Bayern’s free-scoring form, Kane raised concerns after the Zagreb game over how easily Bayern conceded two goals in quick succession, warning it could be a liability against better opposition. Bayern was much tighter at the back in its win over Bremen, which didn’t record a single shot at goal.
Also on Saturday, Hugo Larsson and Omar Marmoush scored as Eintracht Frankfurt won its third game in a row by beating Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-0. 
Vincenzo Grifo scored twice as Freiburg beat Heidenheim 3-0 for its third win in four league games. Union Berlin won 2-1 against Hoffenheim, which has lost three in a row.
Promoted Holstein Kiel earned its first top-division point when Shuto Machino’s 89th-minute goal salvaged a 2-2 draw at Bochum.
On Sunday, Leverkusen hosts Wolfsburg, Stuttgart takes on Borussia Dortmund and Leipzig visits promoted St. Pauli.

NEW YORK (AP) — Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes has a flexor strain in his pitching elbow and was placed on the 15-day injured list Wednesday in a blow to New York’s rotation heading into the playoffs.
Cortes and the Yankees are holding out hope he could return at some point in the postseason, but it didn’t sound likely.
“I don’t know if optimistic. I mean, we’re not ruling it out yet,” manager Aaron Boone said.
Cortes was scratched from his scheduled start Wednesday night against Baltimore and replaced by Marcus Stroman, with the Yankees one win from clinching the AL East title and a first-round playoff bye.
Stroman (10-9) took the loss in a 9-7 defeat, charged with six runs and a season-high 10 hits in 3 1/3 innings. The veteran right-hander had been moved to the bullpen for the final two weeks of the regular season because New York had six healthy starters before Cortes’ injury.
“He’s been great through all of this,” Boone said before the game. “He’s been ready for whatever role comes his way. He’s had a really good year for us, and a big reason why we’re in this position.”
Cortes (9-10, 3.77 ERA) had an MRI on Monday and was put on the IL retroactive to Sunday. 
He won’t throw for at least seven to 10 days, and will seek additional opinions from two renowned experts by sending the MRI results to Dr. Neal ElAttrache and Dr. Keith Meister.
“I’ve been dealing with some tenderness for a few weeks. But it wasn’t until Sunday, I threw my bullpen in Oakland, where it didn’t feel right,” Cortes said. “The ligament looks good. Obviously, there’s like chronic stuff that’s, throughout the year, if you do an MRI to any pitcher, stuff is going to pop up. But (the) UCL is not torn, or there’s no damage to it. So that’s kind of good news.


“I don’t know what the timetable looks like,” he added. “I don’t know if it’s 10 days or 40 days, but I know with rest people get better, and hopefully with treatments that I get, it’s going to feel better.”
Cortes had been a candidate to be New York’s third starter in the postseason behind Gerrit Cole (7-5, 3.67) and Carlos Rodón (16-9, 3.98).
“Certainly feel for him right now,” Boone said. “Just have to pick up the slack there and support him right now and then see what we have over the next several days, just see exactly how he’s responding and things like that.”
Cortes was 4-0 with a 1.58 ERA in his last seven outings (six starts), striking out 38 and walking 10 in 40 innings.
“That’s one of the things that stinks about this, too, is just how well he’s throwing the baseball right now,” Boone said.
Already assured at least a wild-card berth, the Yankees need one victory in their last four games to clinch the division crown. If that’s accomplished, they would open a best-of-five Division Series at home on Oct. 5.
Stroman, rookie Luis Gil and Clarke Schmidt are the remaining candidates to start a potential Game 3. Because there are off days between Games 1 and 2 in addition to between Games 2 and 3, the Yankees likely would need only three starters in that round.
“Definitely the mentality and the way I’m going to go about it is try and come back,” Cortes said. “Depending on how far we go and how well I do with the rehab. Obviously, my main focus is to be able to come back and help this team.”
New York recalled Cody Poteet from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and he provided 3 1/3 effective innings in relief Wednesday night. The right-hander permitted one run and three hits, throwing 57 pitches.

WYOMING, Iowa (AP) — Taking a late-summer country drive in the Midwest means venturing into the corn zone, snaking between 12-foot-tall green, leafy walls that seem to block out nearly everything other than the sun and an occasional water tower.
The skyscraper-like corn is a part of rural America as much as cavernous red barns and placid cows.
But soon, that towering corn might become a miniature of its former self, replaced by stalks only half as tall as the green giants that have dominated fields for so long.
“As you drive across the Midwest, maybe in the next seven, eight, 10 years, you’re going to see a lot of this out there,” said Cameron Sorgenfrey, an eastern Iowa farmer who has been growing newly developed short corn for several years, sometimes prompting puzzled looks from neighboring farmers. “I think this is going to change agriculture in the Midwest.”
The short corn developed by Bayer Crop Science is being tested on about 30,000 acres (12,141 hectares) in the Midwest with the promise of offering farmers a variety that can withstand powerful windstorms that could become more frequent due to climate change. The corn’s smaller stature and sturdier base enable it to withstand winds of up to 50 mph — researchers hover over fields with a helicopter to see how the plants handle the wind.
The smaller plants also let farmers plant at greater density, so they can grow more corn on the same amount of land, increasing their profits. That is especially helpful as farmers have endured several years of low prices that are forecast to continue.


The smaller stalks could also lead to less water use at a time of growing drought concerns.
U.S. farmers grow corn on about 90 million acres (36 million hectares) each year, usually making it the nation’s largest crop, so it’s hard to overstate the importance of a potential large-scale shift to smaller-stature corn, said Dior Kelley, an assistant professor at Iowa State University who is researching different paths for growing shorter corn. Last year, U.S. farmers grew more than 400 million tons (363 million metric tonnes) of corn, most of which was used for animal feed, the fuel additive ethanol, or exported to other countries.
“It is huge. It’s a big, fundamental shift,” Kelley said.
Researchers have long focused on developing plants that could grow the most corn but recently there has been equal emphasis on other traits, such as making the plant more drought-tolerant or able to withstand high temperatures. Although there already were efforts to grow shorter corn, the demand for innovations by private companies such as Bayer and academic scientists soared after an intense windstorm — called a derecho — plowed through the Midwest in August 2020.
The storm killed four people and caused $11 billion in damage, with the greatest destruction in a wide strip of eastern Iowa, where winds exceeded 100 mph. In cities such as Cedar Rapids, the wind toppled thousands of trees but the damage to a corn crop only weeks from harvest was especially stunning.
“It looked like someone had come through with a machete and cut all of our corn down,” Kelley said.
Or as Sorgenfrey, the Iowa farmer who endured the derecho put it, “Most of my corn looked like it had been steamrolled.”
Although Kelley is excited about the potential of short corn, she said farmers need to be aware that cobs that grow closer to the soil could be more vulnerable to diseases or mold. Short plants also could be susceptible to a problem called lodging, when the corn tilts over after something like a heavy rain and then grows along the ground, Kelley said.
Brian Leake, a Bayer spokesman, said the company has been developing short corn for more than 20 years. Other companies such as Stine Seed and Corteva also have been working for a decade or longer to offer short-corn varieties.
While the big goal has been developing corn that can withstand high winds, researchers also note that a shorter stalk makes it easier for farmers to get into fields with equipment for tasks such as spreading fungicide or seeding the ground with a future cover crop.
Bayer expects to ramp up its production in 2027, and Leake said he hopes that by later in this decade, farmers will be growing short corn everywhere.
“We see the opportunity of this being the new normal across both the U.S. and other parts of the world,” he said.
This story was first published on Sept. 23, 2024. It was updated Sept. 24, 2024, to correct the amount of corn that U.S. farmers grew last year. They grew more than 400 million tons (363 million metric tonnes), not 400 tons (363 metric tonnes) of corn.",False

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — The Las Vegas Raiders trailed by six points with just over seven minutes to play when their offense faced fourth and 1 on the Los Angeles Chargers’ side of midfield.
Got to go for it, right?
Coach Antonio Pierce didn’t think so, and it might have cost him the Raiders’ season opener.
After a brief but intense sideline discussion, Pierce sent punter A.J. Cole onto the field at the Chargers 43. Displeasure and confusion rumbled through SoFi Stadium, with a low thundering of boos emanating from the crowd in a metropolitan area where the Raiders are still a home team.
With the game likely on the line, Pierce and his Raiders didn’t try to seize it.
The Chargers did it instead, responding to the punt with a 92-yard touchdown drive for the final points in a 22-10 victory Sunday.
After his first game since getting the Raiders’ top job permanently on the strength of a 5-4 run as the interim coach last season, Pierce defended his decision to go against the NFL’s modern conventional wisdom and most of his fans’ ardent wishes at a key moment.
Pierce repeatedly said he felt Las Vegas’ defense should have been able to get the ball back in time for a winning touchdown drive.
“I mean, we got what we wanted,” Pierce said. “We got them backed up. We’ve got three timeouts there. Play good football, get the ball back (at) midfield, hopefully. But they broke off a long run, and that was the end of it.”


No NFL team had punted on fourth-and-1 inside its opponent’s territory while trailing by one score in the fourth quarter since 2016, according to Sportradar.
“We considered going for it,” Pierce said. “It was a long 1 (yard for a first down). We got stopped earlier in the game. Momentum. The punter had done a good job pinning those guys back. I think he had two or three punts inside the 20. Again, defense was the strength for the most part of the game.”

Indeed, the Raiders’ defense was largely outstanding for the first three quarters against Justin Herbert and the Chargers, allowing just 212 yards and no touchdowns. 
Las Vegas’ offense also got stopped near midfield on fourth and 1 in the first quarter, and that was just one low point in a fairly unimpressive opener. In his Raiders debut, Gardner Minshew passed for 256 yards with one touchdown, one late interception and one comical lost fumble recovered by Khalil Mack shortly before halftime.
The Raiders’ 10 points were their fewest in a season opener since 2006.
“That’s Coach’s decision,” Minshew said of the key fourth down. “But I think anybody that’s a ballplayer wants the ball in their hands with the opportunity to help the team.”
Receiver Davante Adams, who had five catches on six targets for 59 yards, also declined to weigh in.
“I mean, my job is to run routes and do what’s called,” the six-time Pro Bowl selection said. “I don’t really want to get into that.”
Pierce’s decision was highly debatable, but it wasn’t completely indefensible in theory.
Some of the NFL’s top coaches in recent years have also been among the most conservative. The Rams’ Sean McVay and the 49ers’ Kyle Shanahan both have well-earned reputations as being more risk-averse than their counterparts despite being two of the top coaches in the game, while Bill Belichick was particularly cautious later in his career.
But Pierce ranked last in the NFL last season on the Aggressiveness Index, a metric put together by Football Outsiders to measure coaches’ eagerness to go for it on fourth down.
Pierce’s playing career ended in 2009, and he didn’t return to the NFL until 2022 as the Raiders’ linebackers coach. The professional game evolved during his absence, with the importance of being aggressive on fourth downs largely becoming conventional wisdom. Pierce knows it in theory, but putting it into practice as a head coach could still take time.
At least one major football mind saw the logic in Pierce’s decision: Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh.
“I wasn’t surprised or anything,” Harbaugh said. “I mean, the stop we got early in the game played into that. Their punter was doing a good job punting us down in there. I’m sure they felt our offense wasn’t moving the ball. We had a lot of three-and-outs in this game.”

SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Riley Leonard threw two touchdown passes and ran for another, and No. 16 Notre Dame capitalized on No. 15 Louisville’s first three turnovers of the season to hold on for a 31-24 victory Saturday. 
Notre Dame (4-1) relied on a last-minute defensive stand to hand the Cardinals their first loss of the season. Louisville (3-1) had a delay-of-game penalty on a fourth-and-1 at the Notre Dame 46. After the five-yard penalty, an incomplete pass ended the Louisville comeback attempt.
“I give the crowd the credit,” Louisville coach Jeff Brohm said. “It got loud. They couldn’t hear the call from me. That can’t happen. We have to have a better way in a situation with no timeouts and we have to get a first down. That’s on me.”
In addition to the three forced turnovers, Notre Dame held Louisville to 1-of-5 on fourth-down conversion attempts.
“I know the game gets close, but we have a lot of confidence in our defense,” Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman said. “It’s why I’m so aggressive as a coach on fourth down. You got a lot of confidence in your defense.”
Leonard was 17 for 23 for 163 yards. Louisville’s Tyler Shough was 24 for 41 for 264 yards and three touchdowns, but was intercepted once. Shough had thrown 88 passes without an interception this season before getting picked off on a deflected pass.
Louisville committed its three turnovers in the first half and trailed 24-14 at halftime.


“It wasn’t a clean day for us,” Brohm said. “Unfortunately, that’s not good enough to win, having to go on the road, especially at Notre Dame. We had some critical mistakes in key situations.”
After a 56-yard field goal by Brock Travelstead with 11:25 left in the game pulled Louisville within 24-17, Notre Dame surged back to regain a two-touchdown lead.
Leonard’s screen pass to Jeremiyah Love turned into a 32-yard scoring play, and the Fighting Irish were in front 31-17 lead with 9:16 remaining.
Louisville fought back with a 24-yard touchdown pass from Shough to Ja’Corey Brooks with 5:17 left to trim the Notre Dame lead to 31-24.
Louisville grabbed the early advantage in a rainy start at Notre Dame Stadium. T.J. Capers forced a fumble by Notre Dame returner Devyn Ford on the opening kickoff. Tamarion McDonald pounced on the ball at the Fighting Irish 24. 
The Cardinals only needed three plays to cash in. Shough threw a 10-yard strike to Isaac Brown for the touchdown and Travelstead’s kick gave Louisville a 7-0 lead.
Notre Dame then went ahead 21-7 in a span of 5 minutes, 42 seconds.
“We played lights out of the first half, especially offensively,” Freeman said.
Notre Dame answered Louisville’s opening touchdown on its next possession, driving 75 yards on 12 plays. Love bulled his way into the end zone from the 6.
What looked like a huge gain for Louisville turned into the Cardinals’ first turnover of the season. Shough bolted out of the backfield on a misdirection play and raced 43 yards, but Notre Dame’s Leonard Moore caught up to Shough and forced a fumble. Jaiden Ausberry recovered for Notre Dame at its 47. Leonard put the Irish ahead with a 34-yard touchdown pass to Jaden Greathouse.
Leonard raced up the middle for the touchdown after another turnover and the Fighting Irish were up 21-7.
“I thought we did a great job on offense of emphasizing having the urgency to start really fast,” Leonard said. “Even though (the early Louisville touchdown) happened, we had all the confidence in the world that we were going to start fast on offense because we did it every single day in practice.”
Notre Dame’s second fumble, on a run by Jadarian Price, led to the Cardinals closing to 21-14 with 12:28 left in the second quarter when Shough hit Brooks for a 5-yard TD pass.
Louisville’s third turnover came when Notre Dame’s Xavier Watts, who led the nation last season with seven interceptions, picked off a pass and returned it 34 yards to the Louisville 36. 
Watts said that the victory was particularly meaningful for the Fighting Irish. Notre Dame avenged a 33-20 loss at Louisville last season that knocked the Fighting Irish out of playoff contention.
“This was a big win for us, especially with last year’s loss,” Watts said. “We came into this game ready to go.”
Notre Dame: Notre Dame hopes its upcoming bye will allow defensive lineman Boubacar Traore, and defensive backs Benjamin Morrison and Christian Gray and Jordan Faison to heal after all missed time during the game with injuries. Leonard missed one play after a hit to the shoulder.
Louisville: The Cardinals will have to work on eliminating the mistakes that didn’t haunt them in the first three games of the season. Louisville had three turnovers and the Cardinals were 1-of-5 on fourth-down attempts, one that included a crucial delay-of-game penalty.
Notre Dame: The Fighting Irish should get a boost from their second victory against a ranked opponent.
Louisville: Expect the Cardinals to drop a few notches, but a road loss to a ranked opponent may not knock Louisville out of the Top 25.
Notre Dame has a bye week, and then the Fighting Irish host Stanford on Oct. 12
Louisville hosts Southern Methodist on Oct. 5

WASHINGTON (AP) — Kansas City right-hander Michael Lorenzen departed in the third inning of his start against the Washington Nationals on Wednesday night with lower body fatigue in a move the Royals said was made “as a precaution.”
Lorenzen (left hamstring) was activated pregame from the 15-day IL to make his first start since Aug. 27. After his early exit, manager Matt Quatraro expressed optimism he could contribute in postseason games as a reliever.
“We only have four regular season games left,” Quatraro said. “He doesn’t grab one of those starts unless something crazy happens. But you know, when he’s rested I think he’ll be another guy that we can count on out of the pen.”
Lorenzen retired seven batters, striking out two, and did not allow a hit in 28 pitches. He departed with a 1-0 lead midway through Nasim Nuñez’s at-bat after he says he summoned the training staff.
“I could tell my leg reached its limit and I didn’t want to push it,” Lorenzen said. “We’re so close to getting to where we want to be. And I feel like the value of me being available for that is more important than me trying to push through something.”
Daniel Lynch IV entered and completed another scoreless frame as the Royals went on to win 3-0.
The Royals (84-74) currently hold the second AL wild card spot ahead of Detroit (84-74) based on their head-to-head record and are 2 1/2 games in front of Minnesota (81-76) and Seattle (82-77).


The Royals opened their three-game set in Washington with a 1-0, 10-inning win on Tuesday night to snap a seven-game slide and maintain their grasp on the second wild card. They will finish the season with a three-game set against Atlanta, which is currently a half-game back of the final NL wild card place.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers could be without another key offensive player this week after All-Pro tight end George Kittle missed practice with a sore hamstring.
The Niners are lost All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey and star receiver Deebo Samuel to injuries before Kittle reported soreness in his hamstring after Wednesday’s practice. 
Kittle sat out practice Thursday, along with cornerback Charvarius Ward, who reported a sore hamstring and knee. Coach Kyle Shanahan said both players would likely be listed as questionable Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams. 
“They had good practices yesterday then complained of some soreness after, then came in this morning with it,” Shanahan told flagship radio station KNBR on Thursday in his scheduled weekly interview. “So we weren’t going to put them out there today. ... Hopefully they come in tomorrow and can get some work in. Definitely hoping those guys can be available on Sunday but, if not, go to the next guys up.” 
If Kittle is unable to go, the 49ers would be without three of their four players who gained at least 1,000 yards from scrimmage last season. Kittle, McCaffrey and Samuel accounted for 39 of the team’s 60 offensive touchdowns last season. 
Jordan Mason has filled in well for McCaffrey the first two weeks with 247 yards rushing and two TDs over the first two games and could become the seventh player ever to rush for at least 100 yards and a TD in each of the first three games of the season.


The Niners would still have second-team All-Pro Brandon Aiyuk, who has struggled the first two games following a contract dispute that held him out of practice all of training camp, and Jauan Jennings at receiver.

STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) — Ollie Gordon II’s 12-yard touchdown run and two-point conversion catch in the second overtime pushed No. 16 Oklahoma State past Arkansas 39-31 on Saturday. 
Gordon, last season’s Doak Walker Award winner as the nation’s best running back, was held to 49 yards on 17 carries. 
His teammates picked up the slack. Alan Bowman passed for 326 yards and Brennan Presley had 91 yards receiving, caught a touchdown pass and ran for a score.
“Those are the games we talk about forever,” Bowman said. “Don’t want to be in those situations a lot. I think we started out really slow. But be able to kind of fight back and battle back and trust in it — it’s obviously a great win.”
Arkansas (1-1) outgained Oklahoma State 648 yards to 385. But the Razorbacks missed two of their three field goals and had three turnovers to one for Oklahoma State (2-0).
“It’s one loss,” Arkansas coach Sam Pittman said. “It’s not an SEC loss. It’s one that we’ll learn from it and and flush it and then come back. I feel like we’ve got a really good football team. We just — we can’t win games turning the football over.”
Taylen Green passed for 416 yards and ran for 61 for Arkansas. Ja’Quinden Jackson ran for a career-high 149 yards and three touchdowns and Andrew Armstrong had career bests of 10 catches and 164 yards for the Razorbacks.
Oklahoma State overcame a 21-7 halftime deficit.


“At halftime, our coaches were fantastic, the adjustments we made,” Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said. “Players were really good about absorbing information, not panicking, not pointing fingers, taking it back out on the field and executing it and playing much better.”
Presley caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Bowman, and the two-point conversion catch by De’Zhaun Stribling tied the game at 21 early in the fourth quarter.
Oklahoma State got a fourth-down stop, then went to razzle-dazzle. Bowman’s pass off a reverse flea flicker went 63 yards to fullback Jake Schultz to put the Cowboys in the red zone. Presley’s 3-yard touchdown run put the Cowboys up 28-21 with 5:13 remaining.
Green bounced right back with a 43-yard touchdown pass to tight end Luke Hasz, and Arkansas tied the game with 4:01 remaining.
Oklahoma State’s Logan Ward hit a 38-yard field goal with 55 seconds remaining to put Oklahoma State up 31-28. Arkansas, with no time outs, drove 48 yards in eight plays, and Kyle Ramsey’s 44-yard field goal as time expired forced overtime.
Ward and Ramsey both missed field goals in the first overtime — Ramsey from 46 yards, then Ward from 41. Oklahoma State scored first in the second overtime, then the Cowboys stopped the Razorbacks on a fourth-and-short to end the game.
“I think we won the game because we were in better condition,” Gundy said. “The latter part of the third quarter, fourth quarter and overtime — when you get tired, the first thing that goes is your mind. Mentally, you don’t play well. You make mistakes. That didn’t happen.”
Arkansas: Mistakes helped the Razorbacks give away a game they had firmly in control. Gordon’s winning touchdown run came the play after a personal foul against Arkansas. On the drive that gave Oklahoma State a 3-point lead late in the fourth quarter, the Razorbacks committed two pass interference penalties against Presley.
Oklahoma State: The Cowboys proved they could win if Gordon doesn’t post big numbers. He accounted for just 69 yards and one touchdown from scrimmage a week after producing 146 yards and three touchdowns combined rushing and receiving against South Dakota State.
It was a tough day for Ramsey, who was trying to fill large shoes.
Ramsey replaced Cameron Little, who is now kicking for the Jacksonville Jaguars. Ramsey missed field goals of 41 and 46 yards.
Pittman said Ramsey will likely compete with Matthew Shipley for the job going forward.
“I think so,” Pittman said. “I mean, it’s always a competition, but, I think so. I mean, I hate it, you know, I hate it for him. You know, I know we missed a couple, but he also made one. Put us in the overtime. And if we played a little bit better, maybe that wouldn’t have come up, you know?”
Gundy said Oklahoma State linebacker Collin Oliver will be out indefinitely after suffering an injury to his right leg.
Oliver, a preseason All-Big 12 selection, was hurt on a pressure that led to Kale Smith’s 73-yard interception return for a touchdown.
“I think that he’s done for the year,” Gundy said. “I’m not sure. I haven’t gotten an update other than the game when they said that he wasn’t coming back and they thought that he might have had maybe a fracture or a crack or something that I’m not for sure.” 
Arkansas: Hosts UAB on Saturday.
Oklahoma State: Visits Tulsa on Saturday.

Chelsea knew it was getting a talented player by signing Cole Palmer from Manchester City last year.
But maybe not this good.
Palmer created some history on Saturday when he became the first player to score four goals in the first half of an English Premier League match. His flurry of strikes came in Chelsea’s 4-2 win over Brighton that further strengthened the belief that the London team will be a force this season after spending more than $1 billion on players over the past two years.
Palmer was one of the club’s expensive signings — he cost at least 40 million pounds ($50.7 million) — but that looks a bargain now. His 22 league goals last season was second only to Man City’s Erling Haaland and also included a four-goal haul against Everton, and he is already up to six goals in this campaign in just six games.
Palmer is also a regular in England’s squad, scoring the team’s goal in the 2-1 loss to Spain in the European Championship final in July.
How City could have done with having Palmer a few hours earlier on Saturday, when the champion drew at Newcastle 1-1 to drop points for the second straight weekend. Haaland was kept scoreless in a league game for the first time this season and stayed on 10 goals. Defender Josko Gvardiol netted for City instead.
Arsenal took advantage of its big rival’s slip-up by beating Leicester 4-2 thanks to two stoppage-time goals — an own-goal and a close-range finish by Kai Havertz — to join City on 14 points.


Both were a point behind the new leader, Liverpool, which beat Wolverhampton 2-1 thanks to a 61st-minute winner by Mohamed Salah from the penalty spot.
Brentford became the first Premier League team to score inside the first minute in three straight games, but couldn’t hold on following Bryan Mbeumo’s strike after 37 seconds and drew with West Ham 1-1.
Everton gained its first win of the season in beating Crystal Palace 2-1 thanks to two goals by Dwight McNeil and Fulham won at Nottingham Forest 1-0, with Mexico striker Raul Jimenez scoring in a third straight game.
It was City’s first league match since influential midfielder Rodri was ruled out for the season with an ACL injury sustained in the 2-2 draw against Arsenal last weekend and the champions were far from their fluid best without the Ballon d’Or contender.
Haaland barely got a chance at St. James’ Park, so couldn’t tie the record of City great Sergio Aguero in scoring in each of his first six games of a Premier League season. 
Gvardiol was a frequent scorer late last season in his forays forward and put City ahead in the 35th minute, collecting Jack Grealish’s inside pass before cutting inside onto his weaker right foot and shooting low into the corner.
Anthony Gordon converted a penalty for Newcastle’s equalizer in the 58th after the England winger — playing as the central striker in the absence of the injured Alexander Isak — was tripped by City goalkeeper Ederson Moraes after running through on goal.
Arsenal’s players were left dejected by conceding a stoppage-time equalizer at City last weekend.
Six days later, they were celebrating late goals after Leicester, a promoted team without a win so far, threatened to pull off an unlikely draw at Emirates Stadium from two goals down.
Gabriel Martinelli and Trossard scored for Arsenal in the first half, only for the Gunners’ usually obdurate defense to surprisingly let in two goals by Leicester right back James Justin. Justin’s second was a stunning volley with the outside of his right foot that went in off the far post.
Arsenal went back in front in the fourth minute of stoppage time when Leandro Trossard volleyed a deep corner by Bukayo Saka toward goal, though it needed a deflection off Wilfred Ndidi to find a way into the net. Havertz bundled in the fourth in the ninth minute of added-on time.
A league-high fifth win for Liverpool didn’t come easy, even though Arne Slot’s team was playing against the last-placed Wolves at Molineux.
It needed Salah to convert a penalty after a foul by Nelson Semedo on former Wolves player Diogo Jota, who was jeered throughout by the home fans.
Jota provided the pinpoint cross that was headed in by Ibrahima Konate for the opener in first-half stoppage time. A mistake by Konate allowed Rayan Ait-Nouri in for Wolves’ equalizer in the 56th.

ATLANTA (AP) — A final day that wasn’t on the schedule and won’t soon be forgotten. 
An improbable comeback by the New York Mets in the opening game of a makeup doubleheader to secure their playoff berth. A gritty recovery by the Atlanta Braves in the nightcap, stamping their postseason ticket as well. 
And all the Arizona Diamondbacks could do was watch hopelessly from the desert, their hopes snuffed out by two games on the other side of the country.
“You’re just focused on getting into the postseason,” said Braves first baseman Matt Olson, soaked in champagne as he celebrated a 3-0 win in the last game of the regular season. “Whatever it took. If we had to play four games today, we would have done it.”
The regular season went to extra innings after the Mets and Braves had a pair of games rained out last week by Hurricane Helene. They controlled their own fates, with each holding a tiebreaker edge over the defending NL champion Diamondbacks. 
Arizona needed one team to sweep, so they were pulling for the Mets after they overcame deficits of 3-0 in the eighth inning and 7-6 in the ninth to win the opener 8-7, going ahead for good on Francisco Lindor’s two-run homer.
“An instant classic game,” said Brandon Nimmo, whose two-run homer capped a six-run eighth.
The Braves, to their credit, bounced back to get the win they had to have. Even after ace Chris Sale was scratched because of back spasms, journeyman Grant Holmes stepped in to lead off a three-hitter spread among six pitchers.


At the end, in the perfect capper to a wacky day, there were champagne-spraying celebrations in both clubhouses at Truist Park. 
Atlanta, New York and Arizona all finished 89-73. 
Holmes found out he was starting about a half-hour before the first pitch. 
“I was about to go get some food,” said the 28-year-old Holmes, who finally made it to the big leagues this year after a decade in the minors. “They came up to me and said, ‘Hey, you’re going to start this one off today.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, OK, here we go.’”
With their postseason berth locked up, the Mets added left-hander Joey Lucchesi to the roster to start the second game. The 31-year-old left-hander spent most of the season at Triple-A Syracuse, giving up five runs in 4 1/3 innings in his lone big league appearance before Monday,
He looked like an ace against the Braves, who might’ve still been a bit shellshocked after the way they lost the opener. Lucchesi (0-2) allowed just three hits, including a run-scoring single to Gio Urshela, in a six-inning, 111-pitch outing.
But Marcell Ozuna gave the Braves some breathing room with a two-run single in the seventh. Daysbel Hernandez (3-0) earned the win and Raisel Iglesias finished it off for his 34th save in 37 chances.
The Braves also got a scoreless inning from starter Reynaldo López, who had pitched six innings just two days earlier.
“I’m so proud of all those guys,” Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. “It takes the whole building to make something like this happen.”
The Mets were already in party mode after Lindor’s 33rd homer.
Trailing 3-0, with just three singles through seven innings against rookie Spencer Schwellenbach, New York’s offense came to life in the eighth.
The Mets surged ahead with their six-run outburst. The Braves stormed back with four runs in the bottom half, as Ozzie Albies delivered a bases-loaded double with two outs for a 7-6 lead — giving him five RBIs in the game after a two-run homer in the third. 
But New York delivered the final blow with Lindor’s drive into the Braves bullpen off Pierce Johnson (7-5).
“That was one of the craziest games I’ve ever been a part of,” said Carlos Mendoza, the Mets rookie manager. “Just the meaning of it. Coming back in the game and then losing the lead and then coming back again in the ninth. It was unbelievable, like you should write a book.”
Edwin Díaz (6-4) earned the win with a season-high 40 pitches despite giving up Albies’ go-ahead hit, which came after the Mets closer failed to cover first on a play that allowed Jarred Kelenic to reach on a two-out infield hit.
Díaz demanded to return to the mound for the ninth.
“I don’t care what you say, I’m going back out,” he told Mendoza.
New York had lost 77 straight games when trailing by three runs in eighth inning or later since May 17, 2023. With that streak snapped, Díaz slammed his glove to the ground and the Mets celebrated their 11th postseason berth in 63 seasons, the last coming in 2022.
“I’ve never seen a game like that,” Mets owner Steve Cohen said. 
Or a final day like that.
Atlanta had been holding back Sale since his scheduled start last week was rained out, saying they wanted to use him in an elimination game.
But the left-hander wasn’t able to pitch because of back spasms, which Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos said only cropped up after a throwing session Sunday but Snitker conceded had been an issue for some time.
“He’s had it off and on all year,” Snitker said. “Everybody in that room’s got aches and pains at this time of year.”
Sale has been ruled out for the Wild Card Series against the San Diego Padres, but the Braves are hopeful he’ll be able to return if they advance to the Division Series.
Mets: Head back to Milwaukee, where they just played a weekend series, for a best-of-three Wild Card Series that begins Tuesday. The Brewers won five of six meetings during the regular season.
Braves: Were heading to the airport for the four-hour flight to San Diego, where their Wild Card Series also starts Tuesday. The Padres topped the season series 4-3.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Sidney Crosby isn’t sure how much longer he’s going to play hockey.
He remains certain, however, where he wants to do it.
The Pittsburgh Penguins star signed a two-year contract extension on Monday that runs through the 2026-27 season. The deal, which carries an average annual value of $8.7 million, would keep Crosby in Pittsburgh until nearly his 40th birthday.
The agreement came on the eve of Crosby’s 20th training camp with the Penguins, who took him with the first overall pick in the 2005 draft. Crosby had been eligible to sign an extension on July 1. While talks dragged on longer than expected, Crosby said last week he was “pretty optimistic” about something getting done before the season began.
Crosby indicated the hold-up was merely his lack of clarity on how much longer he intends to play.
“Trying to project how you’re going to feel in a number of years, it’s hard,” Crosby said. “Just making sure that it’s something that made sense for both myself and the team.”
The 37-year-old Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup winner and two-time league MVP, didn’t ask for a raise even though he remains one of the most productive players in the NHL. Crosby led the Penguins in goals (42), assists (52) and points (94) last season, well clear of the rest of an underachieving club that missed the playoffs for a second straight year.
“Sidney is the greatest player of his generation and one of the greatest players in the history of the game,” general manager Kyle Dubas said in a statement. “His actions today show why he is one of hockey’s greatest winners and leaders. Sid is making a tremendous personal sacrifice in an effort to help the Penguins win, both now and in the future, as he has done for his entire career.”


Crosby’s salary staying flat gives the Penguins a little more wiggle room as the NHL’s oldest team tries to figure out a way to get back into contention.
Pittsburgh has missed the playoffs each of the last two seasons after making it 16 consecutive years between 2007 and 2022. Crosby said he received reassurances from Dubas during the negotiating process that the club remains committed to being competitive while trying to build a younger core around Crosby and longtime teammates Evgeni Malkin (38) and Kris Letang (37).
“There’s still hunger from the organization (and) ownership to win and a commitment,” Crosby said. “From the time I’ve been here, that’s the case and that’s been there. That’s important.”
Dubas said Crosby’s decision to stay at $8.7 million — a cap hit that ranks outside the top 40 in the NHL despite having perhaps the most accomplished resume of any active player — is symbolic of Crosby’s commitment to helping Pittsburgh rebuild on the fly.
“His dedication to the Penguins through 2027 ensures that our franchise will have its captain as we go through this phase of our project,” Dubas said.
Crosby has played in more games (1,272) than any player in team history and trails only Mario Lemieux in every other major category, including goals (592, 2nd), assists (1,004, 2nd), and points (1,596, 2nd). Crosby will begin the 2024-25 season 10th all-time in league history in points. Last year he became just the second player ever to average at least a point a game in 19 seasons, joining Wayne Gretzky.
The Penguins open training camp on Wednesday and begin the regular season on Oct. 9 at home against the New York Rangers. Signing Crosby removes a significant potential distraction and lets Crosby focus on his game, which remains elite even as he finishes his second decade in the NHL.
“I feel good,” he said. “I still love the game and want to compete and I’m not going to project too far ahead, but I’m going to try and play as long as I can.”

BEIRUT (AP) — Thousands of families from southern Lebanon packed cars and minivans with suitcases, mattresses, blankets and carpets and jammed the highway heading north toward Beirut on Monday to flee the deadliest Israeli bombardment since 2006.
Some 100,000 people living near the border had already been displaced since October, when the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces began exchanging near-daily fire against the backdrop of the war in Gaza. As the fighting intensifies, the number of evacuees is expected to rise.
In Beirut and beyond, schools were quickly repurposed to receive the newly displaced as volunteers scrambled to gather water, medicine and mattresses.
In the coastal city of Sidon, people seeking shelter streamed into schools that had no mattresses to sleep on yet. Many waited on sidewalks outside.
Ramzieh Dawi had arrived with her husband and daughter after hastily evacuating the village of Yarine, carrying just a few essential items as airstrikes boomed nearby.
“These are the only things I brought,” she said, gesturing at the three tote bags she carried.
Fatima Chehab, who came with her three daughters from the area of Nabatieh, said her family had been displaced twice in quick succession.
“We first fled to stay with my brother in a nearby area, and then they bombed three places next to his house,” she said.
Some people waited for hours in gridlocked traffic to get to what they hoped would be safety.


The Israeli military warned residents in eastern and southern Lebanon to evacuate ahead of a widening air campaign against what it said were Hezbollah weapons sites. More than 490 people were killed in Lebanon on Monday, officials said, and more than 1,240 people were wounded — a staggering toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week.
That attack was widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility.
Israeli officials have said they are ramping up pressure against Hezbollah in an attempt to force it to stop firing rockets into northern Israel so that tens of thousands of displaced Israelis can return home. Hezbollah has said it will only stop when there is a cease-fire in Gaza.
At a public high school in the capital’s Ras al-Nabaa neighborhood, a few dozen men, women and children were milling around as volunteers registered them.
Yahya Abu Ali, who fled with his family from the village of Doueir in Lebanon’s Nabatieh district, struck a defiant tone.
“Don’t think that an airplane or a missile will defeat us, or that a wounded person or a martyr on the ground will weaken us,” he said. “On the contrary, it gives us strength, determination, and resilience.”
But Abu Ali also admitted that he was worried about his four siblings and their families who remained behind in southern Lebanon.
“God willing, I hope they will make it out,” he said.
Minar al-Natour, a volunteer at the school, said the team on the ground was still in “early stages” of preparations to host the larger numbers expected to arrive.
“We’re securing medicine, water, and of course all the essential supplies,” she said.
In Beirut’s Aisha Bakkar neighborhood — where some residents had received messages instructing them to evacuate — shop owner Mazen al-Hakeem said most had not heeded the call.
“There is no fear but there is anticipation,” he said. “People are filling their tanks with fuel, storing food and groceries. They are taking their precautions.”
Imran Riza, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Lebanon, said in a statement the international body had allocated $24 million in emergency funding for people affected by the fighting.
With its economy in shambles and Beirut still recovering from a massive port explosion in 2020, Lebanon is “grappling with multiple crises, which have overwhelmed the country’s capacity to cope,” Riza said.
“As the escalation of hostilities in south Lebanon drags on longer than we had hoped, it has led to further displacement and deepened the already critical needs,” Riza said.

Publication date:2024-09-08 07:00:00

CLEVELAND (AP) — Lying face down in the grass, Deshaun Watson couldn’t see another of his passes sail out of bounds.
Everything about his return on Sunday was off target.
Watson didn’t look comfortable from the start in his first game since breaking a bone in his right shoulder in November as the Cleveland Browns were blasted 33-17 in their season opener by the Dallas Cowboys.
This was not the comeback Watson or the Browns had hoped for as the 28-year-old quarterback tries to jump-start his career after making just 12 starts over the past two seasons due to an NFL suspension and shoulder surgery.
Cleveland’s new-look offense was hard to look at.
Watson spent much of the day running from Dallas defenders as Cleveland’s offensive line, missing both of its starting tackles, struggled to keep their quarterback upright. He was sacked six times and the Cowboys were credited with 17 hits on Watson.
“Yeah, he got hit way too often,” coach Kevin Stefanski said. “We can’t let that happen to him. He fought like crazy, and listen, the football team fought like crazy to the end. But bottom line is, we have to protect our quarterback better than that.”
Watson also took several hard shots while running after the pocket collapsed. He said his surgically repaired shoulder held up fine, but Watson said he couldn’t gauge how he was overall physically until the adrenaline wore off.


It wasn’t too early for him to address a poor performance that triggered booing from Cleveland fans in the first half and a mass exodus in the third quarter.
“We’re not the type of people that make excuses,” Watson said. “So some people can say that can contribute a lot, you know, my injury, guys missing time. But at the end of the day, once you’re on the field, you gotta perform, you gotta execute.

“We didn’t do that overall. And yeah, it showed.”
Watson didn’t play in the preseason as the Browns chose to keep him as healthy as possible. The long layoff certainly affected his timing. Watson missed some easy throws, was hesitant on others and never got into a rhythm.
Cleveland’s offense, which has been re-designed by Stefanski and first-year coordinator Ken Dorsey, sputtered badly in the first half. The Browns picked up just one first down and gained only 54 yards in the first 30 minutes.
Watson finished 24 of 45 for 169 yards with two interceptions and one TD.
It was ugly, but Watson said the outing didn’t shake his confidence.
“Hell no,” he said. “I’ll always be Deshaun Watson, regardless of whoever else says otherwise. We all have days like this when you’re playing this type of game, and that’s just part of what comes with it. It comes with the territory.
“And especially in my position: much is given, much is required.”
As bad as things went, Watson found some perspective after a trying few days.
Following the game, he sat quietly at his locker and mostly listened during an extended conversation with backup QB Jameis Winston. General manager Andrew Berry stopped to offer support.
Watson said his father died on Friday and that a former teammate passed away Saturday. He said the Browns told him he didn’t have to play.
‘Football is definitely something that you got to take very, very seriously and it’s our job, it’s our career,” Watson said. “But you know, there are other things that are bigger than this. It’s been a long week and they gave me the opportunity to go back home, but I told them I wanted to be here with my guys.”

LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Colorado’s offensive line has five new starters, 11 newcomers and a new position coach — and the results remain the same when it comes to the blocking up front. 
That much was apparent in the Buffaloes’ 28-10 loss at Nebraska on Saturday night. The Cornhuskers had six sacks and 10 quarterback hurries and allowed just 16 yards rushing.
“Protections were,” coach Deion Sanders said, pausing, “were a problem. Trying to be polite and say it, because, you know, I can say the same thing you’re thinking, but if I said (it), you would say I’m throwing my guys under the bus. I’m not doing that whatsoever. Protections were a problem.”
The Buffaloes hoped to show improvement on the offensive line after allowing 56 in 12 games last season, second most in the Football Bowl Subdivision behind Old Dominion’s 62 in 13 games.
Phil Loadholt, an offensive analyst at Oklahoma the previous two years, replaced Bill O’Boyle as offensive line coach.
The offensive line was revamped and now is made up of tackles Tyler Brown and Jordan Seaton, guards Justin Mayers and Kahlil Benson and center Hank Zilinskas.
Brown redshirted and didn’t play last season for the Buffs. Seaton is a true freshman who was a five-star recruit and rated by ESPN as the No. 1 high school tackle in the nation. Mayers (UTEP) and Benson (Indiana) are transfers. Zilinskas started two games and appeared in nine others for CU.


Of the 15 offensive linemen on the online roster Sunday, only four were on the team in 2023.
The Buffs were encouraged with their pass protection in their opener, allowing one sack and two quarterback hurries in a 31-26 win over North Dakota State of the second-tier Championship Subdivision. Four of the five starting linemen graded above average in pass blocking in the game, according to Pro Football Focus. But only one, Zilinskas, got an above-average grade in run blocking as the Buffs managed just 59 yards rushing against NDSU.
Nebraska, a fellow power-conference team, exposed the Buffs’ line. Shedeur Sanders was sacked once on each of CU’s first four possessions and running back Charlie Offerdahl also got stuffed twice for a loss on fourth-and-1s.
Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola, meanwhile, never got sacked and was hurried only four times, and the Huskers rushed for 149 yards.
Shedeur Sanders has proved he can escape trouble and make big plays, but with no running game against the Huskers, those were at a premium Saturday.
“How many times did Raiola get touched?” he said. “Of course whenever you’re able to run the ball consistently, it opens up the pass. But you have to understand what you’re team is good at. Why we keep running the ball if we’re out there and get in a situation where it’s a must-get and we don’t get it?”
The Buffs’ 75 total rushing yards through two games are fewest in the nation, and five of CU’s 16 non-sack rushing attempts against Nebraska went for no gain or a loss.
“Very rarely do you have a great running offene and a great passing offense,” Deion Sanders said. “One is going to have to be the lesser of the two. We have to figure out a way to have some type of running game because we have backs who can flat-out do it. We really do.”
Colorado ranks 120th in the FBS with seven sacks allowed in two games and will go into its road meeting with Colorado State ranked 127th out of 134 FBS teams in pass blocking efficiency, according to Pro Football Focus.
By PFF’s count, Brown has allowed 11 pressures in two games, tied for second most in the FBS, and Seaton’s nine are tied for fifth. 
“We have to be able to handle the pressure,” Deion Sanders said. “I’m not saying (the pressure of) rushing the passer. The pressure of the game, the pressure of the moment, the presure of the time. Everybody wants to be ‘him’ until it’s time to be ‘him.’ We got to be able to handle the pressure.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Brandon Nimmo hit a tiebreaking, sixth-inning home run off Zack Wheeler that sailed just over the glove of leaping right fielder Nick Castellanos, and the New York Mets beat Philadelphia 2-1 on Sunday night to prevent the Phillies from clinching the NL East at Citi Field.
Edwin Díaz got his second career six-out save, his first since since Aug. 4, 2022. He stranded Trea Turner at third when Alec Bohm grounded out in the eighth and Bryson Stott at third in the ninth when Kody Clemens struck out.
“We’ve been protecting him the whole year and now it’s big boys’ time,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said.
New York (87-69) took three of four from the Phillies and has won 18 of its last 23 games to move a season-high 18 games over .500. The Mets passed Arizona into the second of three NL wild-card slots, ahead of the Diamondbacks because they won the season series 4-3, and stayed two games ahead of the Braves (85-71). New York finishes the regular season with three games each at Atlanta and Milwaukee.
Philadelphia (92-64) needs one win in its last six games to clinch its first NL East title since 2011. The Phillies host the Chicago Cubs in a three-game series starting Monday night.
“Hopefully we get it done because that’ll be exciting,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said.
Nimmo led off the sixth with his 22nd homer, breaking a 1-1 tie when he pulled a first-pitch fastball over the 8-foot fence.


“This is playoff atmosphere, playoff baseball and really you see how much more every pitch means in these games,” Nimmo said. “These guys are just rising to the challenge and it’s just a beautiful thing to see.”
Before a boisterous crowd of 43,139, the second straight Citi Field sellout but just the fifth this season, Tylor Megill allowed four hits over four innings, and Phil Maton (3-3), Joey Butto and Díaz combined for five innings of one-hit ball and Díaz got his 20th save in 26 chances this season.
Francisco Alvarez’s throw on Stott’s steal hit third base but popped up by third baseman Mark Vientos, who grabbed the ball with his bare hand after a bounce, forcing Stott to hold.
“I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen that,” Thomson said.
Mets star Pete Alonso, eligible for free agency after the World Series, was given a standing ovation when he walked to the plate in the first inning. Alonso tipped his helmet and tapped it to his heart. He went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and was given another standing ovation in the eighth.
“It’s right out of a storybook for me,” Alonso said. “It’s truly, truly remarkable to be able to see and feel that reaction and appreciation from a packed house like that.”
Wheeler (16-7), who had won his previous four starts, allowed two runs and seven hits in seven-plus innings.
Turner singled in the first, advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Bohm’s two-out single.
Vientos doubled in the second, hustling into the base ahead of Johan Rojas’ throw from center and came home when Tyrone Taylor singled past a diving Bohm at third.
J.D. Martinez was benched by the Mets for the second straight day and struck out as a pinch hitter in the eighth, extending his career-worst slide to 0 for 32.
New York drew 2,285,147 for 78 dates this season, down from 2,573,555 last year.
Phillies: OF Austin Hayes (kidney infection), out since Sept. 1, was 0 for 4 with a walk and two strikeouts, playing left field for Triple-A Lehigh Valley. He could be activated Tuesday. ... RHP Spencer Turnbull, sidelined since June 26 by a right lat strain, pitched two innings for the IronPigs and allowed Tyler McDonough’s two-run homer. He likely will throw batting practice on Thursday at the Phillies’ complex in Clearwater, Florida.
Mets: RHP Kodai Senga won’t pitch again during the regular season after feeling felt tightness in his right triceps during a minor league rehab outing Saturday. ... SS Francisco Lindor (back) missed his seventh straight game but participated in more intense pregame workouts. The Mets hope he can return Tuesday.
Phillies: RHP Aaron Nola (12-8, 3.54 ERA) starts Monday’s homestand opener against the Chicago Cubs.
Mets: RHP Luis Severino (11-6, 3.79) opens a three-game series at Atlanta on Tuesday. The Braves start RHP Spencer Schwellenbach.

LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) — Victor Boniface’s added-time goal lifted Bayer Leverkusen to a 4-3 comeback win over Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga on Sunday as the German champion produced another of its trademark late breakthroughs ahead of facing Bayern Munich next week.
It seemed Xabi Alonso’s team might have missed its chance when Granit Xhaka rattled the goalpost with a stoppage-time curling shot, but soon after Boniface made the breakthrough.
All of Wolfsburg’s players — down by one thanks to a red card for Yannick Gerhardt — were packed into the penalty area but Boniface, fresh from showing off an eye-catching skill in Leverkusen’s 4-0 win over Feyenoord, suddenly found space in a crowd of three opponents to turn and shoot past goalkeeper Kamil Grabara. 
It was the second time in four Bundesliga games this season that Leverkusen has won in added time. That followed an almost unbelievable series of dramatic finishes in its title-winning season.
Leverkusen had to twice come back from a goal down against Wolfsburg to give itself a chance at the win.
New signing Nordi Mukiele’s fifth-minute own goal put Wolfsburg ahead but Leverkusen answered with goals from Florian Wirtz — his fourth in eight days — and Jonathan Tah. 
Wolfsburg was the leader again by halftime after Sebastiaan Bornauw and Mattias Svanberg scored, but defender Piero Hincapie leveled the score again for Leverkusen with a header early in the second half.


Leverkusen’s games have been nothing if not entertaining this season, with a combined 22 goals in four Bundesliga games — 13 for, nine against — and including a rare 3-2 loss to Leipzig last month. That leaves Leverkusen three points behind Bayern, whose new coach Vincent Kompany has overseen four wins from four league games, scoring 16 goals and conceding only three. That means Bayern will likely stay top on goal difference even if it loses to Leverkusen on Sept. 28.
Just when it seemed new coach Nuri Sahin had given Borussia Dortmund a consistency it was sorely lacking last season, his team crashed to a 5-1 loss at Stuttgart.
Deniz Undav set Stuttgart on course for victory with a fourth-minute opening goal and capped the win with another in the 90th as his team sought to prove its second-place finish in the Bundesliga last season was no fluke.
The result ends a five-game unbeaten run in all competitions for Dortmund under Sahin, who replaced Edin Terzic after last season, and gives Stuttgart a boost after losing 3-1 to Real Madrid on Tuesday.
St. Pauli earned its first point since promotion — and since coach Fabian Hürzeler left for Brighton — with a 0-0 draw at home to Leipzig. 
St. Pauli had the better chances and could have won the game in added time when a shot from substitute Scott Banks went narrowly wide of the post.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Oakmont’s already massive greens will be even more daunting when the men’s U.S. Open returns next summer for a record 10th time.
The club situated in the northern Pittsburgh suburbs has restored more than 24,000 square feet of green surface over the last two years as part of a renovation guided by golf course architect Gil Hanse.
Hanse initially was brought in to focus on the bunkers. During his trips to the course, he came across photographs from the 1920s and 1930s and noticed the greens used to be much larger before several factors — time and natural erosion most of all — began chipping away at them.
He talked to the club, whose membership enthusiastically agreed the renovations were a chance to make the notoriously fast greens even harder than they were when Dustin Johnson won his first major at Oakmont in 2016.
While the changes this time around won’t be quite as visible as they have in the past — Oakmont has spent most of the last 30 years removing thousands of trees in hopes of returning to its wind-swept, links-style roots — the 155 players who will join defending champion Bryson DeChambeau could find pins tucked in places they’ve never been before during previous Open stops at the venerable course that opened in 1904.
“The greens are the No. 1 defense on the course,” grounds superintendent Mike McCormick said Monday. “Oakmont, in today’s world, it’s not a crazy long golf course. There are several holes out here the players will be hitting wedges into and it puts even more of an emphasis on (the greens).”


The course will play at 7,372 yards as a par 70 in 2025, a tick up from the 7,219 yards it played at in 2016.
One of the new pin options the expanded greens give the USGA is on the 182-yard, par-3 13th hole. Pin placement previously was limited to the left side of the green, with little wiggle room in terms of yardage. Now there are a variety of options, including a back-right pin that sits in the middle of a bowl, rewarding a good shot but almost inaccessible from other portions of the green, particularly the front right.
U.S. Open scores have trended lower of late. Only one of the last eight winners has posted a higher four-round total in relation to par than Johnson’s 4-under 276, with the last six champions all finishing at 6-under or better.
Scott Langley, the USGA’s senior director of player relations, thinks Oakmont remains one of the stiffest tests because it lacks the kind of shot options places like Pinehurst No. 2 (2024) or Los Angeles Country Club (2023) provide.
“You have strategic width (in those places), you can play the angles more,” Langley said. “There are spots here where you do that. But by and large, Oakmont is you hit a good shot or you don’t. And if you don’t, the penalty is pretty uniform.”
The more notable changes besides the greens are a new-look fairway on the 485-yard, par-4 seventh hole that offers players two choices: play it safe and short to the right but settle for a blind approach or aim left and try to carry a drive 320+ yards over a fairway bunker that if executed correctly lets you see the pin on your approach with a short iron.
Oakmont also rebuilt every hazard and revamped the course’s nearly 200 bunkers while updating the drainage system. The club was hit by nearly 3 inches of rain during the early rounds of the U.S. Open’s last visit, forcing the grounds crew and volunteers to get creative while bailing out the sand traps.
“The bunkers had deteriorated significantly from 2016 to 2022,” McCormick said. “There’s a lot of newer technology and ways to drain bunkers and hold sand and limit contamination. So the club had an opportunity to make sure that the performance of the playing surfaces (remained consistent).”

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams ended his contract holdout and reported to the San Francisco 49ers to finalize a new deal that have him a significant raise and guaranteed money.
Williams’ agency, Elite Loyalty Sports, posted on social media Tuesday that Williams’ new deal will pay him $82.66 million over three years with a $25.69 million signing bonus and $48 million guaranteed at signing.
“I didn’t think that it would get this drawn out, but it’s a tough business,” Williams said. “This was a very intricate contract, I wouldn’t call it a dispute, but restructure. It took time to get to where both sides feel like it’s a win-win.”
The 36-year-old Williams was owed $20.05 million this season under the six-year, $138.1 million deal he signed in 2021 that had no guaranteed money remaining. Williams joins Tristan Wirfs, Penei Sewell and Christian Darrisaw as tackles getting deals this offseason worth at least $26 million a year.
Williams had been back home in Texas for all of training camp while seeking a new deal, accumulating nearly $5.4 million in mandatory fines for missing camp and three preseason games.
“I try not to think about it,” Williams said of the fines. “It’s one of the things where you kind of know you’re going to leverage. ... For lack of a better word, it’s kind of a war, where both sides are going to lose a little blood, but you wave the white flag at the end. We both sign a little peace treaty, and we’re good.”


Williams said it was difficult missing training camp and that the time away from his teammates reinforced that he was still hungry to compete. It also led to some depression as he watched everyone else around the league prepare for the season.

“You think of a kid not being able to go out for recess and having to watch everybody through the window,” he said. “It was some really up and down times. There were times where I didn’t know if it was really worth it. I just needed that camaraderie. I wanted to see my boys. I hadn’t seen them in a long time. Obviously last time we were together, it wasn’t what we wanted it to be.”
But he got a new contract, with the 49ers resolving both of their major contract disputes before the season opener on Monday night against the New York Jets. San Francisco signed star receiver Brandon Aiyuk to a four-year, $120 million extension last Thursday, ending his contract “hold in.”
The moves mean the Niners will have nearly every significant player from last season’s standout offense back to start the 2024 season. The only players missing who played at least 200 snaps on offense last season are fill-in guard Jon Feliciano, backup tight end Charlie Woerner and No. 4 receiver Ray-Ray McCloud.
Getting Williams back might have been the most important because he is one of the most irreplaceable pieces on a star-studded roster.
Williams has been widely considered the top offensive linemen in the game in recent years. He has been the All-Pro left tackle the past three seasons and has been a major reason for San Francisco’s offensive success.
Williams said he’s in no rush to end his career and would like to play until he’s 40, pointing to former Rams tackle Andrew Whitworth winning a Super Bowl at age 40 as inspiration.
“I’m going to play as long as I can,” he said. “As long as I feel like I’m a productive player, as long as I feel like I have something to offer, I’m going to want to play football. That’s all I’ve done since the second grade. But Father Time is undefeated from what we’ve seen. Obviously you can fight him off for a little bit. Going through this process, that was kind of the goal.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — After striking for over a month, video game performers have reached agreements with 80 games that have signed interim or tiered budget agreements with the performers’ union and accepted the artificial intelligence provisions they have been seeking. 
Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began striking in July after negotiations with game industry giants that began more than a year and a half ago came to a halt over AI protections. Union leaders say game voice actors and motion capture artists’ likenesses could be replicated by AI and used without their consent and without fair compensation.
SAG-AFTRA announced the agreements with the 80 individual video games on Thursday. Performers impacted by the work stoppage can now work on those projects. 
The strike against other major video game publishers, including Disney and Warner Bros.’ game companies and Electronic Arts Productions Inc., will continue. 
The interim agreement secures wage improvements, protections around “exploitative uses” of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances, as well as vocal stress. The tiered budget agreement aims to make working with union talent more feasible for independent game developers or smaller-budget projects while also providing performers the protections under the interim agreement. 
Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA’s national executive director and chief negotiator, said in a statement that companies signing the agreements are “helping to preserve the human art, ingenuity and creativity that fuels interactive storytelling.”


“These agreements signal that the video game companies in the collective bargaining group do not represent the will of the larger video game industry,” Crabtree-Ireland continued. “The many companies that are happy to agree to our AI terms prove that these terms are not only reasonable, but feasible and sustainable for businesses.”

Publication date:2024-09-26 00:35:00

HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Raiders coach Antonio Pierce accused some players of making “business decisions” Sunday in a 36-22 loss to the Carolina Panthers and promised he would be willing to make some of his own.
Pierce didn’t back off that statement when he met with the media Monday, but Wednesday, said any decisions were between him and the team.
So, if Pierce and his staff decided to make personnel changes, they won’t reveal exactly what until Sunday when Las Vegas hosts the Browns.
What is certain is the Raiders need to change something — be it their execution, schemes, attitude, whatever — when Cleveland visits. Regardless, Pierce appeared to have in true Bill Belichick fashion moved on to the next opponent.
“There’s no panic button,” Pierce said. “We’re not throwing out our parachutes and jumping off the plane. We’re good. It was a loss and it was a tough loss, and we move on.”
How many changes Pierce could make is debatable. He already said he’s sticking with Gardner Minshew at quarterback, and injuries have limited how many pieces throughout the rest of the roster he can shuffle.
Las Vegas and Cleveland, each 1-2, are desperate for a victory to keep their playoff hopes realistically alive. Only 42 teams after opening 1-3 have made the postseason since the league merger.
Circumstances quickly changed for the Raiders, who just last week were coming off the high of going to Baltimore and winning 26-23. Then winless Carolina came to Las Vegas and taught the Raiders a harsh lesson about taking each opponent seriously.


The Panthers arrived with a new starting quarterback in Andy Dalton after having won just twice in their previous 19 games.

Thus the “business decisions” comment by Pierce after the game in which the Raiders at one point trailed 33-7, his insinuation that some players put their own welfare ahead of the team once the game got out of hand.
It’s unusual for a coach to be so blunt publicly, and it could cause some dissension in a locker room. Players to this point not only have solidly backed Pierce but they were instrumental in seeing he was named the coach after taking over the team on an interim basis midway through last season.
“Just curious to see how we respond in general, not just based off of what he said,” wide receiver Davante Adams said. “It shouldn’t take a coach to say something to you to get you fired up and motivated to turn it around. So just looking to see how the guys respond, myself included.” 
The coaches and players met Monday to discuss what happened in Baltimore and how they could move forward.
Adams wouldn’t reveal details of what was said, but noted “there was obviously a lot of accountability and a lot of discussion ... just communication in general to get on the same page.”
Running back Zamir White said he came out of the meeting feeling more positive about the team’s direction.
“It wasn’t just about the players,” White said. “It was about everybody. We really got personal. We talked a lot about what we learned from and we move from the last game.”
The odd part about last week is the Raiders felt confident, with Pierce even calling Thursday’s practice the best of the season.
Pierce said he wouldn’t make more such declarations again, but stood by his statement.
“We compete on Thursdays with our scout team, so there weren’t no gimmes,” Pierce said. “Friday was a good day. Saturday was a good day. Sunday was a bad day.” 
But he said he knew in the first drive, in which the Panthers went 70 yards on nine plays to score a touchdown, that the Raiders were in trouble.
This week is about putting together more practices like Thursday’s but finding a way for that to carry over to game day.
“Every season is weird, every season is different, but you’re going to have to go through things to ultimately be the team you want to be,” defensive tackle Christian Wilkins said. “The path to success is never really easy. So if we want certain things and we want to achieve certain things, there’s going to have to be tough lessons and tough things along the way.”
Defensive end Maxx Crosby didn’t practice Wednesday because of a lingering ankle injury. He had only three tackles against Carolina and was clearly limited.
Linebacker Divine Deablo (oblique), right tackle Thayer Munford (knee/ankle) and cornerback Decamerion Richardson (hamstring) also did not practice.

TORONTO (AP) — Jonatan Clase hit his first career home run, Kevin Gausman pitched six innings to match his career high in wins and the Toronto Blue Jays beat Boston 6-1 on Wednesday night, eliminating the Red Sox from postseason contention.
Clase went 3 for 3 with a walk, scored twice and drove in two. He extended Toronto’s lead with a homer off Josh Winckowski in the seventh inning.
“A really good night from him,” manager John Schneider said.
Alejandro Kirk, who extended his career-best hitting streak to 17 games, had three hits and three RBIs as the Blue Jays won for the first time in six games and avoided a three-game sweep. Boston had been 5-0 in Toronto this season.
The Blue Jays finished 21-31 against AL East opponents for the second straight year.
Gausman (14-11) allowed one run and four hits to win his second straight start. He walked three and struck out three, and ended his outing by retiring Nick Sogard on a fly ball with the bases loaded.
“It’s always good when you can tie a career high,” Gausman said, “but I wish I would have been throwing the ball like last year.”
The Red Sox, who had won four in a row coming into the game, needed to win their final four games and get help from opponents in the American League wild-card race.
“At one point it felt like we were a playoff caliber team and then we missed the opportunity,” manager Alex Cora said. “Let’s put it that way. You look around, you look at the teams that are fighting. We had it right there and we blew it.”


Boston went into the All-Star Game with a 53-43 record but a poor second half sank the Red Sox, starting with a three-game sweep at the Dodgers right out of the break.
“Since LA, we never got it going,” Cora said.
Boston has missed the playoffs in three straight seasons, the first time that’s happened since 2010-2012. The Red Sox won the World Series in 2013.
“I’m proud of what this clubhouse was able to do and what we accomplished,” said outfielder Jarren Duran, who was 2 for 4 for his 50th multi-hit game. “It’s a good building block for the next year.”
Red Sox right-hander Richard Fitts (0-1) came in having not allowed a run over 15 2/3 innings to start his big league career, and extended that streak to 18 2/3 before Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Kirk hit consecutive doubles to begin the fourth.
Guerrero finished 2 for 4 and has 197 hits this season.
Fitts was charged with four runs and six hits in five innings. He walked two and struck out two.
“This was a crucial game for us,” Fitts said. “I just really feel like I let the team down. I know I have better and I can be better.”
Kirk drove in two with a two-out single off the right field wall in the fifth, but Wilyer Abreu threw Kirk out trying to advance to second.
The Red Sox finished their road schedule at 43-38. They’re 37-41 at Fenway Park with three games remaining.
Blue Jays: Toronto recalled RHP Brett de Geus from Triple-A Buffalo and optioned RHP Tommy Nance to the spring training facility.
Blue Jays: SS Bo Bichette was scheduled to have surgery Wednesday on his fractured right middle finger.
Red Sox: Boston returns home Friday to wrap up its season with a three-game series against Tampa Bay.
Blue Jays: Toronto closes out the season by hosting Miami in a three-game series starting Friday.

GENEVA (AP) — U.N.-backed human rights investigators on Friday urged the creation of an “independent and impartial force” to protect civilians in Sudan’s war, blaming both sides for war crimes including murder, mutilation and torture and warning that foreign governments which arm and finance them could be complicit.
The fact-finding team, in their first report since being created by the U.N.’s main human rights body in October, also accused the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which are fighting Sudan’s army, and its allies of crimes against humanity, including rape, sexual slavery and persecution on ethnic or gender grounds.
“The people of Sudan have suffered greatly, and the violations against them must stop. This cannot be done without ending the fighting,” Mohamed Chande Othman, the chair of the team, told a news conference.
The experts called for the expansion of an arms embargo on Sudan’s long-restive western Darfur region to the entire country.
The findings from the team mandated by the 47-country Human Rights Council come as more than 10 million people have been driven from their homes — including more than 2 million to neighboring countries — and famine has broken out in one large camp for displaced people in Darfur.
The conflict that erupted in April 2023 has killed untold thousands of people, and humanitarian groups are struggling to gain access to people in need. In December, the U.N. Security Council voted to end the world body’s political mission in the country under pressure from the military leadership. 


While the killings, displacements and forced starvation have been long known, the call for creation of an independent force marks the latest sign of desperation from rights advocates both within the country and abroad to halt the bloodshed, displacement and food crisis.
“Given the failure of the parties to protect civilians so far, the fact-finding mission recommends the deployment of an independent and impartial force with a mandate to protect civilians in Sudan,” the team’s report said.
The experts didn’t specify what might make up that force, nor did they say which countries might be complicit in the crimes through their backing of rival sides. Sudan’s military has accused the United Arab Emirates of supporting the RSF, a claim that the Gulf country has denied. 
Neighboring Egypt is among the backers of Sudan’s armed forces. 
“The fact-finding mission considers that fighting will stop once the arms flow stops,” the report said. It called for an immediate end to funneling weapons, ammunition and other support to any side, “as there is a risk that those supplying arms may be complicit in grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law.”
The experts focused on a period from January and August this year. They visited three neighboring countries and took testimonies from more than 180 survivors, relatives and witnesses to the conflict that now has spread to 14 of Sudan’s 18 states.
Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, a team member, said conflict-related sexual violence had a “long and tragic history” in Sudan, and civilians — overwhelmingly women and girls — “were, and continue to be, targeted with sexual violence in particular rape (and) gang rape by both parties to the conflict.”
Earlier this month, talks in Geneva convened by the United States, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia made some headway in getting aid into Sudan, but mediators lamented the lack of participation of Sudan’s armed forces. Egypt, the UAE, the African Union and the United Nations were also involved in the talks.
The U.N. World Food Program in Sudan reported that trucks carrying 100 metric tons of food entered Sudan on Friday through the Adre crossing from Chad, which reopened on Aug. 20. 
Since then, WFP has transported a total of 1,500 metric tons of food and nutrition supplies, enough for 130,000 people, United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.
Some aid has already been delivered to Mornei in West Darfur, an area at famine risk, he said. The rest is on its way to other West Darfur communities that are at risk of famine, though no aid is getting into the North Darfur capital, El Fasher, which is besieged by the RSF, Dujarric said. 
The fact-finding team has little power to affect events on the ground in what the U.N. has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Its report mainly serves to train a spotlight on rights abuses and violations for the world community and help inform International Criminal Court prosecutors.
Othman, speaking to The Associated Press, said that the team hadn’t compiled “concrete evidence” about which countries were funneling weapons and money to the rival sides beyond what they had seen in media reports, but that the issue was “worth investigating.”
“It should be assigned to some person or some agency to look into it, because it is serious in the context of the protracted war in Sudan,” he said.

Publication date:2024-09-25 22:48:00

ATLANTA (AP) — The final two games of a crucial series between the New York Mets and Atlanta Braves were postponed Wednesday by heavy rains ahead of Hurricane Helene.
Now, a wild-card race that seemed headed to the final day of the regular season may require an extra day.
And a doubleheader, at that.
The regular season was set to end Sunday, but the Mets are now scheduled to return to Atlanta on Monday for a pair of games 40 minutes apart that could determine who heads to the playoffs.
New York plays three games in Milwaukee against the NL Central champion Brewers beginning Friday, while the Braves have a weekend series against the Kansas City Royals, a playoff contender in the AL.
“We’ve got to move on to the next series now,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. “We’re facing another really good team in Milwaukee and we’ve got to go out there and not only win a series but we’ve got to go out there and take care of business. That’s the only thing we can do: control the things we control.”
The Mets (87-70) went into the day with a half-game lead over Arizona in the wild-card race, with the Braves (86-71) a full game back. Two of those teams will make the playoffs, which are set to begin Tuesday with the best-of-three wild-card round.
“I hope the Royals can get here,” said Braves manager Brian Snitker, looking ahead to an ominous forecast for the next two days as the hurricane’s remnants move through Georgia. “I would hope we don’t get things screwed up for their series.”


The Diamondbacks had a game Wednesday night against the San Francisco Giants. Arizona is off Thursday before a three-game series at home against the San Diego Padres to close out the regular season.
The Braves beat the Mets 5-1 on Tuesday night in the opening game of the series against their NL East rivals. 
Both teams were off Monday, but there was no indication that the teams or MLB considered moving up the start of the series. Also, there was a missed opportunity to get in Wednesday’s game before heavy rain swept through the area during the afternoon.
Mendoza said he didn’t have discussions with MLB until just before the decision was made to postpone both games at 5:11 p.m. EDT — about two hours before the first pitch Wednesday.
“Look, my job is to manage a team,” he said. “We knew there was weather, but you can’t predict it. We came here (Tuesday), lost a game, and we were ready to play today and we just got a call.”
With the final two games in Atlanta pushed back, the Mets could be facing an especially grueling travel schedule over the next week.
It’s not out of the question that they will fly to back to Atlanta for the doubleheader Monday, then hustle to grab another flight — either back to Milwaukee or to the West Coast — for the start of the wild-card series on Tuesday should they make the playoffs.
Then again, they did get a couple of unplanned off days before that final stretch.
“I mean, it could be beneficial,” Mendoza said. “A couple of guys needing an extra day or two and your bullpen is going to be a little bit fresher.”
There is a chance the doubleheader would not be needed if the playoff race is settled by Sunday, but Mendoza wasn’t sure if there was a contingency plan.
“I’m not going to get too far ahead,” he said. “Right now, we’ve just got to concentrate on the next series.”
Mets: SS Francisco Lindor was set for a return to the Mets’ lineup in the leadoff spot. He had missed the last eight games with lower back discomfort. Now, he’ll have a couple of extra days to rest up.
Braves: RHP Reynaldo López (shoulder inflammation) said he could return to the mound for the series against the Royals. He is eligible to come off the injured list Thursday and said his shoulder feels good after a couple of weeks off.
Mets: New York plans to leave for Milwaukee on Thursday morning, with Mendoza still trying to sort out his pitching plans. LH Jose Quintana (10-9, 3.74 ERA) had been set to start the series opener against the Brewers, but those plans are likely to be shuffled now. LH David Peterson (9-3, 3.08) and LH Sean Manaea (12-5, 3.29) had been set to start the final two games in Atlanta.
Braves: Chris Sale (18-3, 2:38) and Max Fried (10-10, 3.42) are likely to be pushed back to starts on Friday and Saturday against the Royals, though Snitker has yet to decide who will pitch on what days in the series. RH Charlie Morton is also in the mix.

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Kyler Murray and the Arizona Cardinals couldn’t sustain momentum in their bid to get off to a fresh and fast start to the season.
And this time they couldn’t complete a “Hail Murray” to come back and beat the Bills.
“I felt like we deserved to win that,” Murray said after a 34-28 loss at Buffalo on Sunday. “We should have won.”
For all that went right for Arizona, too many things went wrong in an outing during which the Cardinals scored on their first three possessions of an opener for the first time in 18 seasons, but still squandered a 17-3 lead.
One disappointment was how Murray struggled to get the ball to No. 4 overall pick Marvin Harrison Jr. throughout the receiver’s NFL debut. Harrison finished with just one catch on three targets for just 4 yards. One of Murray’s passes sailed behind the receiver; Harrison dropped another.
On the bright side, DeeJay Dallas gave Arizona hope in the fourth quarter by cutting the lead to 31-28 with his 96-yard return for the first touchdown under the NFL’s new dynamic kickoff rule.
Ultimately, the loss came down to the Cardinals falling short on their final drive.
Facing fourth-and-7 from Buffalo’s 29, Murray scrambled to his left and heaved a pass toward Greg Dortch near the goal line only to have it broken up by Ja’Marcus Ingram and Damar Hamlin. The high-arcing pass was reminiscent of the since-dubbed “Hail Murray” four years ago when the quarterback heaved a 43-yard touchdown to DeAndre Hopkins with 2 seconds left in the Cardinals’ 32-30 win against the visiting Bills.


“Bang-bang play. We’ll make more of those than we won’t,” coach Jonathan Gannon said. “Good back and forth game. What I like about this group is their will to not waver. We’ll keep our confidence. We’ll get back in the lab tomorrow and fix up what we need to.”

One missed opportunity that stood out on the final drive came when Murray was scrambling to his left and completed a 7-yard pass to Dortch for a first down, while failing to see Harrison running wide open up the right side.
“When you play football, there’s a lot of stuff moving around, moving fast,” Murray said. “You don’t see everything.”
Gannon stuck up for his quarterback, saying: “Whatever decision he made, we felt like that was the right one.”
Harrison declined to address reporters after the game. The 22-year-old is the son of former Colts star receiver Marvin Harrison. He won the Biletnikoff Award as the top receiver in college last season for Ohio State and was the first of a record seven receivers chosen in the first round of the draft.
Gannon credited the Bills defense with taking Harrison out of the offense. 
“That’s how our offense is going to be built,” he said. “The ball will go where it should go, depending on the coverage.”
“I wouldn’t say they were taking him away,” Murray said. “As a quarterback, you go through your reads sometimes, and the ball goes to the best option.”
Murray finished 21 of 31 passing for 162 yards and a touchdown to Michael Wilson on the opening drive. He also gained 57 yards on five runs. But after halftime, Murray was 5 of 12 for 23 yards.
Buffalo went ahead 24-17 late in the third quarter when Allen found Khalil Shakir for an 11-yard touchdown. That came five plays after Greg Rousseau forced Murray to fumble. Rousseau’s third sack came when he beat backup right tackle Kelvin Beachum, who came in after Williams hurt his knee in the first quarter.
Arizona’s offense gained 191 yards in scoring on its first three drives for the first time since its season-opening win against San Francisco in 2006.
“We stayed on schedule,” Murray said. “When you’re on the road, coming out in a first game, haven’t really played football in a long time, in a live atmosphere like that, coming out against a great team, you don’t want to be moving backwards.”
“That was the difference,” Murray concluded, “between the first half and the second half.”

Kansas’ resurgence under coach Lance Leipold reached new heights last season with a 9-4 record and a 49-36 win over UNLV in the Guaranteed Rate Bowl. Kansas has an opportunity Saturday for a road victory in a sold-out stadium that hasn’t been filled since 2016 against what appears to be an improved Illinois team. 
Kansas’ offense vs. Illinois’ defense. The Jayhawks have piled up 500 or more total yards 13 times in Leipold’s 39 games as coach, including three in a row. The Illini defense was porous and prone to penalties last season and gave up 24 or more points nine times.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Exceptionally heavy rainfall pounding Central Europe has prompted deadly flooding in the region, with four new deaths reported Monday in Poland, three in the Czech Republic and one in Romania.
The flooding has swamped parts of Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania as a low-pressure system crossing the region has unleashed record-high rains for days, and it was expected to affect Slovakia and Hungary later in the week. So far 16 people have been reported killed — seven people in Romania, five in Poland, three in the Czech Republic and one in Austria. 
In Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk held an emergency meeting and later declared a disaster in flooded areas, a government measure to facilitate evacuation and rescues. He also said the government would provide 1 billion zlotys ($260 million) in immediate payouts to victims.
The flooding in Poland has burst dams and embankments while receding waters left streets covered in piles of debris and mud. It prompted a hospital in the southwestern Polish city of Nysa to evacuate about 40 patients. 
Schools and offices in the affected areas were closed Monday and drinking water and food were being delivered by trucks. Many Polish cities, including Warsaw, have called for food donations for flood survivors. 
Experts warned of flood threats due to the cresting Oder River in Opole, a city of some 130,000 residents, and Wroclaw, home to about 640,000 residents and where disastrous flooding happened in 1997.


Firefighters in southwestern Poland said flood victims included a surgeon whose body was found Monday morning in Nysa after he returned from hospital duty. The bodies of two women and two other men have been found in other communities in the region. 
Police in the Czech Republic said that a woman and two men drowned in the northeast, which has been pounded by record rainfall since Thursday. The woman was found in the water in the town of Krasov and the men were found dead at different locations after water receded in the town of Krnov which was almost completely submerged on Sunday
Romanian authorities said Monday that another person died in the eastern county of Galati, bringing the total number of deaths there to seven. 
One death previously was reported in Austria.
Authorities in the Czech Republic declared an emergency in two northeastern regions, including in the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border.
A number of towns and cities had been submerged in the northeast, with thousands evacuated. Military helicopters joined rescuers on boats in efforts to transport people to safety. Waters were receding from the mountainous areas on Monday, leaving behind destroyed houses and bridges and damaged roads.
In most parts of the country, conditions were expected to improve later Monday.
Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala visited the town of Jesenik, one of the hardest hit places.
“The worst is behind us and now, we have to deal with all the damage,” Fiala said following the visit. 
In Hungary, the mayor of Budapest warned residents that the largest floods in a decade were expected to hit the capital later in the week, with the waters of the Danube River set to breach the city’s lower quays by Tuesday morning.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán canceled his planned foreign engagements, including an address to a plenary session of the European Parliament on Wednesday where heated debates were expected over his conduct since Hungary took over the European Union’s rotating presidency in July. 
“Until we reach the peak and get past the worst of it, I naturally won’t be leaving the country, I’ll be here at home,” he said. 
Budapest Mayor Gergely Karácsony wrote on Facebook that the city would use 1 million sandbags to bolster flood defenses, and asked residents to take extra care when near the river.

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — By the time Dominic Solanke slid in Tottenham’s third goal, some Manchester United fans had seen enough.
Trailing 3-0 after 77 chastening minutes at Old Trafford, they vacated their seats and headed out into the Manchester rain. In the background were the mocking sounds of the visiting Spurs supporters.
“Is there a fire drill?” came a joyous chorus from the away end.
There have been many occasions like this under Erik ten Hag. When his team has looked bereft of ideas and confidence. When a stadium known as the Theatre of Dreams has become the stuff of nightmares.
“First we have to deal with this and show resilience. This is not good enough,” Ten Hag admitted afterward. “We have to accept this and get better.”
Tottenham’s victory mirrored Liverpool’s win by the same margin in United’s previous Premier League home game at the start of the month.
Ten Hag said similar things back then, but problems persist. 
Goals by Brennan Johnson, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke consigned United to a third loss in the league already this season. The record 20-time champion, which was reduced to 10 men after Bruno Fernandes’ red card, is 12th in the standings after just one win in its last five games in the league. 
United has also failed to win any of its last three games in all competitions and there were boos inside the stadium from some of the fans that remained at the final whistle. 


Spurs supporters were even more brutal during the game — directing chants of “You’re getting sacked (fired) in the morning” toward Ten Hag.
The United manager, who only held onto his job after winning the FA Cup last season and being subjected to an end of year review, said such thoughts weren’t on his mind — even in the face of such a troubled start to the campaign and a slew of changes made under new minority owner Jim Ratcliffe. 
“No, I’m not thinking about this. We all made, in togetherness, this decision to stay together,” he said, adding that all parties “knew it would take some time”.
As bad as this latest setback for Ten Hag was, it could have been worse, with goalkeeper Andre Onana twice denying Timo Werner in one-on-one situations. He also stopped Solanke from scoring his second when through on goal late on. 
While Onana prevented a rout, this was another humbling day for United, which began with Johnson’s opener in the third minute.
The forward was left with an open net to aim at after defender Micky van de Ven was allowed to run from his own half and cross from inside the box.
Johnson might have added another when firing against the post as Spurs dominated from the start. 
In response Alejandro Garnacho volleyed against the post with a rare chance for United.
But any chance of a comeback was dealt a major blow after Fernandes was shown a straight red for a studs-up challenge on James Maddison shortly before the break. 
Spurs didn’t have to wait long to double the lead, with Kulusevski adding a second two minutes into the second half by flicking a shot past Onana from Johnson’s cross before Solanke added a third. 
“We were real good. Obviously it is a great victory,” Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou said. “That is everything we want to be.”
Aston Villa missed the chance to move level on points with Premier League leader Liverpool after a 2-2 draw at Ipswich earlier Sunday. 
Liam Delap scored twice for newly promoted Ipswich to earn a point at Portman Road. 
Villa had led 2-1 at halftime, but Delap’s goal in the 72nd ensured the points were shared. 
Villa remained in fifth place and Ipswich is 15th after a fourth-straight draw in the league. 
Delap fired Ipswich into a surprise lead in the eighth with a low effort at the near post. Morgan Rogers leveled the score seven minutes later as Villa capitalized on the Ipswich defense’s failure to clear the danger from its own box and drilled past goalkeeper Arijanet Muric.
Ollie Watkins headed the visitors in front in the 32nd when rising to meet Leon Bailey’s cross from the right for his fourth goal in as many games.
But Villa’s hopes of leapfrogging Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea were ended by Delap’s second from inside the box.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Reid Detmers worked six solid innings and Brandon Drury and Niko Kavadas homered to lead the Los Angeles Angels to a 6-2 victory over the struggling Minnesota Twins on Monday night.
Detmers (4-6) was making his second straight quality start after spending three months at Triple-A Salt Lake. The 25-year-old left-hander allowed five hits and struck out eight — including the last three batters he faced — for his first win since April 12 against Boston when he started the season 3-0. He allowed three hits and struck out 10 in six innings in a no-decision against the Los Angeles Dodgers last Tuesday in his first appearance since June 1 after being demoted to the minors after months of inconsistency.
“You always want to finish strong, especially these last starts I have left,” Detmers said. “Obviously give it your all, but trying to get my name back out there, trying to make a statement and show everybody who I am.”
Drury hit his fourth homer of the season, a two-run shot, in the third inning and Kavadas added another two-run homer, his third, in the sixth.
Kyle Farmer homered for the Twins, who struck out 12 times and lost their fourth straight game. Minnesota has scored just 13 runs in losing six of its last seven games. The Twins are 6-15 in their last 21 games, yet remain third in the American League wild-card standings, three games ahead of idle Detroit and Seattle.
“There’s times where you’re going to struggle for a moment at the plate, and right now unfortunately it’s contagious for us. But hopefully we’ll snap out of it tomorrow,” said Royce Lewis, who went 0 for 4 and is hitless in his last 20 at-bats.


David Festa (2-6) allowed a two-run single to Nolan Schanuel in the first and a 459-foot home run to Drury in the third inning as the Angels took a 4-0 lead. Festa was lifted after four innings.
“The game was a little bit out of our reach pretty much from the start and we were never able to get that moment where we were able to pull ourselves back. But we need to string together those good at-bats,” manager Rocco Baldelli said. “It feels like we’re piecemealing it a little bit. We’ve got to do more as a collective group and get the three, four, five good at-bats in a row.”
Carlos Santana had an RBI single in the third for Minnesota and Farmer homered in the fourth before Kavadas lined a home run to right field off Ronny Henriquez in the sixth to stretch the Angels’ lead to 6-2.
José Suarez, recalled Monday from Triple-A Salt Lake City, threw three hitless innings for this first career save. Since June 17, Los Angeles relievers lead the majors with a 2.62 ERA.
“He came out with intent from the first pitch because his first pitch was 95. He usually builds up as he goes along, but tonight he came out there and got on it right away,” Angels manager Ron Washington said.
Angels: 3B Anthony Rendon (back soreness) missed his second straight game as a precaution. He’s expected to return Tuesday. … OF Jo Adell (left oblique strain) was moved to 60-day injured list.
Twins: SS Carlos Correa, out since July 12 with right plantar fasciitis said a new treatment is working and expressed optimism he’ll be back soon. … CF Byron Buxton took defensive drills Monday as he attempts to get his hip pain to the point where he can play through it. … CF Willi Castro left the game due to illness. … C Christian Vázquez was placed on the paternity list and C Jair Camargo was recalled from Triple-A St. Paul.
Los Angeles plans to start RHP Griffin Canning (5-12, 5.02) Tuesday in the second game of this three-game set. RHP Pablo López (14-8, 4.05) is the scheduled Minnesota starter.

Publication date:2024-09-23 07:00:00

NEW YORK (AP) — Many years into their marriage, Stephen and Evie Colbert suddenly became co-workers. And that is why, in a roundabout way, we have their first cookbook. 
During the pandemic, Evie helped keep her husband’s “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on the air at CBS while the couple hunkered down in their South Carolina home.
“Evie was my crew and my only audience and my only guest. And it turned out we worked together well,” Stephen Colbert says. “We said, ‘We’ve always wanted to do something together. I think the thing to do would be a cookbook.’”
What emerged is “Does This Taste Funny?: Recipes Our Family Loves,” a collection of tried-and-true Colbert clan dishes like Spicy Lemon Chicken Thighs or Panfried Spot Tail Bass that also opens a window into their lives.
“It had to be a personal story because we’re not professional cooks. It’s all about our personal experience,” says Stephen Colbert.

The dishes range from a simple teriyaki-flavored pork loin — good for busy parents on a weekday for dinner — to an extravagant Beef Wellington, a fillet steak with mushrooms and prosciutto, wrapped in puff pastry, then baked.
It is a cookbook that also charts a love affair, celebrates extended family and rejoices over places visited — idiosyncratic and yet universal. There are four different recipes for fudge — each boasts it is the definitive one — submitted by the Colbert siblings.


A trip to a San Francisco restaurant in late 2007 inspired the recipe in the book for a clam chowder that is brothy, vegetable-forward and has plenty of clam meat.
“I don’t even know if the soup was as good as I remember it. We were just young parents with a moment away and big frosty glasses of sancerre,” says Stephen with a laugh. “Everything was tasting pretty good.”
Friends and family were tapped for their favorite dishes, like deviled eggs from Evie’s dad and chicken l’orange from Stephen’s mom. There are also photos and stories of their three children. 
“For Stephen’s career, we purposefully kept our children out of the limelight, and when we sat down to do this, we realized, ‘Oh, we’re involving a lot of family. How do we feel about that?’ And it felt like a wonderful way to be personal,” says Evie. “It felt very much like a collective project that way.”
Many of the dishes lean on the South, which is natural since both grew up in Charleston, South Carolina. There are Lowcountry recipes for pickled shrimp, pork belly sliders and red rice, a dish Stephen says he enjoys making the most. 
“At my little elementary school growing up, we had it just about every day. And it was fantastic. And this recipe comes closest to that really jammy, salty, smoky red rice I grew up with.” 
This image released by Celadon Books shows a table spread featuring a red rice dish, top center, from the cookbook “Does This Taste Funny: Recipes Our Family Loves” by Stephen Colbert and Evie McGee Colbert. (Eric Wolfinger/Celadon Books via AP)
Going back even further is Stephen’s Kindergarten Soup, which he learned to make helping the cook at Martin Luther Kindergarten. It calls for celery, carrot, onion, tomato, okra, corn, butter beans, green beans, peas and beef. The cookbook includes a photo of 5-year-old Stephen’s drawn recipe.
“It is the first recipe I ever learned. And my mom did hang up that recipe in her kitchen and take it down and make it every so often,” he says. He now laughs at its plainness, a yesteryear where it was “iceberg lettuce and salt and pepper for flavor.”
The Colberts have upped their sophistication levels since then, of course, including in the cookbook a recipe for duck breast with fig-orange sauce.
“People are afraid of duck, but it is really, really simple. Start in a cold pan, render it out. Save that duck fat for the potatoes you’re going to want with this later. Throw in some fig jam or any jam in with a little orange juice. It’s fantastic,” Stephen says.
Making the cookbook reconnected the couple to their roots. “It put us back in touch with all the food we grew up with and the people who taught us how to make these recipes,” says Evie, who still refers to recipes as receipts, the way her mother did.
One of her favorites is the flounder stuffed with crab meat that she grew up with. “I was really happy to rediscover that recipe. It was one that I had sort of forgotten about. And when I worked on the cookbook with my mother, we talked about that recipe. And so we had to get her approval on when we made it.”
Jokes Stephen: “Some of these recipes had to be released from their national security designation.”
The book ends with breakfast recipes. “If the party goes well, hopefully you’re spending the night,” he says. “The breakfast is the reward.”
While the pair clearly enjoy each other’s company, things in the kitchen weren’t always so smooth. They both point to the “spoon story.”
When they were married in 1993, someone gave them a nonstick Calphalon pan. Evie hadn’t grown up with non-stick cookware and used a metal spoon with it.
“So Stephen and I are married, and he walks into the kitchen one day and he says, ‘You’re using a metal spoon on a nonstick pan.’ I really thought he was going to say, ‘I’m sorry, we have to get divorced,’” Evie says.
“I believe I offered you a wooden spoon,” says Stephen. 
“That didn’t go over well,” she replies.
“Boy, the look on her,” he says, laughing. “She’s almost over it. She’s so close to forgiving me.”",False

Publication date:2024-09-26 18:42:00

WASHINGTON (AP) — Launchpad Strategies was incorporated less than a year ago and has since received $15 million from Donald Trump’s election fundraising machine. 
For what is mostly a mystery. Campaign finance records indicate the limited liability company was hired to provide online advertising, digital consulting and fundraising. On its website, the firm boasts it is a “full-service Republican digital agency run by expert strategists.”
Yet, those expert strategists aren’t identified. An online contact form does not appear to work. And business registration records in Delaware provide no clues as to who owns or runs the firm. The campaign’s checks are sent to a P.O. Box in North Carolina. 
Campaign finance experts said Launchpad Strategies was built for anonymity and is the latest example of how the Trump campaign has used secretive businesses to obscure its spending from the public.
“The Trump campaigns sort of exhibit a lot of the patterns of behavior that we’ve become accustomed to with Trump and his associates,” said Michael Kang, a law professor at Northwestern University. “There does seem to be some kind of self-dealing in a lot of what they do when it comes to their financial matters.”
An Associated Press review of Federal Election Commission records shows that more than $876 million moved through Trump’s campaigns and pro-Trump fundraising committees over the past nine years to six limited liability companies, including Launchpad Strategies. The filings meet the minimum disclosure requirements, yet the final recipients of the cash are unknown.


The $15 million paid to Launchpad Strategies is a fraction of the huge sums spent during presidential elections. But the lack of transparency makes it impossible to know if money donated by Trump’s supporters was spent wisely or could be personally benefiting the former president’s aides and allies.
The AP was not able to identify a representative for Launchpad Strategies from whom to seek comment. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about Launchpad Strategies or the other such companies it has paid. But its attorneys have argued previously in a federal filing that campaigns and fundraising committees are rarely required to itemize the “ultimate payees” of a contractor’s expenses. 
While other political campaigns have relied on vendors with hazy origins, Trump’s operation has set its “own standard in terms of doing it far more than anyone else,” said Saurav Ghosh of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, which advocates rigorous enforcement of campaign finance law.
The payments to Launchpad Strategies have evoked earlier allegations the Trump campaign subverted federal rules designed to prevent candidates from concealing how they spend donor dollars.
But the government agency that enforces federal campaign finance laws is unlikely to do much about it.
A deep ideological divide among the FEC’s commissioners has stymied almost 30 investigations recommended by agency lawyers of accusations Trump’s campaign broke the rules. One closed complaint alleged two of the limited liability companies were used to mask millions of dollars in payments to Trump family members or vendors controlled by campaign staff.
The FEC’s evenly divided structure and a polarized political environment have paralyzed the agency at a time when presidential and congressional elections are awash in money. The Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling opened the floodgates of election spending and raised the potential for misconduct. Yet no more than three of the FEC’s six commissioners can be from the same political party, leading to frequent gridlock.
What to know about the 2024 Election
FEC attorneys, for example, have advised commissioners to investigate 29 of the 59 complaints against the Trump campaign or his fundraising committees, according to a tally maintained by FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat. The agency pursued none of them.
The dysfunction, according to campaign finance experts, has given political campaigns the green light to ignore the transparency voters need to make informed decisions.
“It’s hard to know if a secretive group like Launchpad is doing anything improper, and it’s unlikely that the current Republican FEC commissioners would approve an investigation to find out,” said Michelle Kuppersmith, executive director of the Campaign for Accountability, a government watchdog group. “By repeatedly stonewalling merited complaints, they’ve made it clear that they have no interest in taking a closer look at any campaign activity tied to Donald Trump.”
The Trump campaign is not the only one to employ opaque firms. President Joe Biden’s presidential campaigns paid $522 million to a Georgia company called Media Buying & Analytics LLC. Its current address is a UPS mailbox at an Atlanta strip mall. Vice President Kamala Harris took over Biden’s campaign account when he dropped out of the race in July.
Unlike Launchpad Strategies, however, Media Buying & Analytics left digital fingerprints. A Federal Communications Commission form linked the company to Canal Partners Media, an established firm aligned with the Democratic Party.
Bobby Kahn, president of Canal Partners Media, acknowledged CPM owns Media Buying & Analytics and said the company was formed to handle the heavy accounting and paperwork load of a presidential campaign. Both companies are independent of their clients, he said.
Before Launchpad Strategies’ stealthy entry into Trump’s orbit, FEC records and a congressional transcript provide insights into how two of these limited liability companies operated. 
Former 2020 Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, assisted by campaign attorneys, established American Made Media Consultants in Delaware just after his appointment to the post to relieve him of time-consuming political advertising duties. He picked a campaign finance official named Sean Dollman to run the company, according to an interview Dollman had with House Jan. 6 committee investigators.
The campaign would at times tell him which subcontractors to hire, Dollman said. One of them was Phunware, a financially troubled Texas cellphone app developer that had built ties to Parscale. 
The Trump campaign promoted Dollman to chief financial officer in early 2020 while he was still in charge of American Made Media. His salary would grow to $40,000 a month as more money flowed to the company for advertising-related work. Dollman did not respond to messages seeking comment. 
FEC filings show Trump’s campaign paid American Made Media $782 million.
The Campaign Legal Center lodged a complaint with the FEC in July 2020 alleging American Made Media functioned as a “conduit” to conceal transactions with people “under the direction and control of the campaign.”
The center also accused the Trump campaign and the Make America Great Again fundraising committee of “routing campaign staff salary payments” through Parscale’s political consulting firm, Parscale Strategy. Two of the recipients were Lara Trump, the former president’s daughter-in-law, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a lawyer who was dating Donald Trump Jr.
The Trump campaign derided the complaint as a “headline-seeking publicity stunt,” according to its response to the FEC. 
But FEC attorneys determined the allegations had merit. In April 2022, they recommended the FEC’s commissioners approve a formal investigation based on a “reason to believe” campaign finance law may have been violated.
Votes from at least four of the six commissioners are required to move ahead with an investigation. They split, 3-3, killing the probe.

Publication date:2024-09-23 14:03:00

IndyCar on Monday finalized a charter system for 25 entrants that, while it pales in comparison to the contentious deal reached between NASCAR and its teams over their revenue sharing model, does give 10 open wheel organizations some guarantees.
The initial agreement runs through the 2031 season and ensures the 25 chartered cars a starting spot in all IndyCar races except the Indianapolis 500. Teams will still have to qualify on speed for the Indy 500’s 33-car field, and that was one of the biggest elements of negotiations as opinions were divided among traditionalists and those seeking greater value for their teams.
Chartered entries are also the only cars eligible for the Leaders Circle program, which is a monetary bonus awarded by IndyCar to the top 22 finishers at the end of each season. That bonus money covers significant portions of some teams’ annual budgets.
“This is an important development that demonstrates an aligned and optimistic vision for the future of our sport,” said Mark Miles, president and CEO of Penske Entertainment Corp. “We’re pleased to have a system in place that provides greater value for our ownership and the entries they field.”
Charters were extended to team owners based on full time entries over the previous two seasons and capped at three per team. The cap most affected Chip Ganassi Racing, which fielded five cars this year.


But Ganassi has created an alliance with Meyer Shank Racing and Marcus Armstrong will move to MSR after two seasons with Ganassi. It is not clear what will happen to the fourth car at Ganassi, who also fielded entries for six-time champion Scott Dixon, three-time champion Alex Palou, and rookies Linus Lundqvist and Kyffin Simpson.
Lundqvist had indicated at last week’s season finale that he would be the odd man out with no plans for 2025.
Andretti Global, Arrow McLaren, Ganassi, Rahal Letterman Lanigan and Team Penske all received three charters. AJ Foyt Enterprises, Dale Coyne Racing, Ed Carpenter Racing, Juncos Hollinger Racing and MSR received two charters each.
Prema Racing, which is entering IndyCar next year with two cars, did not receive any charters. The team announced last week Callum Ilott as the first of its two drivers.
Most teams were pleased with the system, which is essentially a franchise tag that gives team owners something of value beyond cars, parts and pieces.
“It is incredibly challenging to get a large group of owners to agree on something, and certainly there was some give and take but, in the end, I believe this is a path that is beneficial for all of the owners and for IndyCar, while also maintaining the availability for open competition,” said Larry Foyt, president of A.J. Foyt Enterprises.
But the system does little to move the needle for Arrow McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown, who wasn’t sure what the team actually gained in the charter agreement.
“I have found that there’s nothing material in there that drives for us any substantial incremental value. So if the hype was this is going to be a big thing and be great for the foundation of an IndyCar team, I haven’t seen those benefits,” Brown said. “It’s not bad. I think it’s good that it’s a first step. But there’s no revenue sharing model. Indy, I don’t have a guaranteed spot.
“It really only helps, from my perspective, helps in an event if a race is oversubscribed. If we had a (crash) in qualifying ... and couldn’t qualify, I’m protected to make the race. From what I can see, that’s what I’m getting.”
But rival Ganassi ranked the arrival of charters in IndyCar importance behind only the merger of the defunt CART Series with the IRL that create America’s current open-wheel series, and Roger Penske’s 2020 purchase of the series and Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
“When you look back in the modern era of IndyCar racing, you will look at a few important moments,” Ganassi said. “I truly believe the charter system will be the third.”
NASCAR earlier this month ended two years of tense negotiations on a new charter agreement with its teams. Both Michael Jordan-owned 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports refused to sign the new deal, and most teams said they did so reluctantly because they didn’t believe they could get anything more from NASCAR.
NASCAR’s charter agreement includes a revenue sharing model, while IndyCar’s does not. That’s because IndyCar does not have the lucrative television package that NASCAR must split between its stakeholders.
IndyCar did sign a new television deal with Fox Sports that begins next year, and team owner Ed Carpenter indicated the TV package and charter agreement paved the way for upcoming organizational announcements. Presumably, Carpenter needed the charter system finalized and the Leader’s Circle bonuses for his two cars to be able to sign his 2025 lineup.
“ECR will have announcements soon and I don’t know that they would be possible without the help of a program like this,” Carpenter said. “With this groundbreaking development, the new TV deal with FOX and the momentum that had been building, IndyCar’s future is very bright.”

Publication date:2024-09-23 07:00:00

CINCINNATI (AP) — The search for a new manager for the Cincinnati Reds will begin immediately following the firing of David Bell after six seasons, president of baseball operations Nick Krall said Monday.
The team announced the move on Sunday night hours after a 2-0 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bench coach Freddie Benavides was named interim manager for the final five games of the season. Most of the other coaches will be retained until a new manager is hired.
Krall cited inconsistency, philosophical differences, players not playing to their potential, and some young players who were added to the roster last season not developing as fast as the organization had hoped.
“When you look across the board, I thought we should have been better,” he said.
The 52-year-old Bell — whose grandfather Gus and father Buddy both spent part of their careers playing in Cincinnati — was hired by the Reds in October 2018. He had a 409-456 record over six seasons.
His contract had been extended in July 2023.
“We made the decision to extend David last season because I thought we were moving in the right direction as we promoted a younger core of players to develop in the big leagues,” Krall said. “But after reflecting on everything this season, I decided we needed to move in another direction with the leadership in the major league clubhouse. That’s why we made the change.”
With a week left in the season, the Reds are 76-81 and in fourth place in the NL Central, 13 1/2 games behind division champion Milwaukee. Cincinnati closes out the season with five road games. The Reds have a two-game series in Cleveland on Tuesday and Wednesday before closing out the campaign with three games in Chicago against the Cubs. 


“If we make the decision now it allows us to meet with everybody (in the organization) on the last road trip, it allows us to start this process and it gives us a week head start instead of waiting when you know what the decision is going to be,” Krall said.
Under Bell in 2020, the Reds earned a postseason berth in his second season, which was shortened by COVID-19 to 60 games.
The Reds finished the 2021 season with a respectable 83-79 record, good enough for third place in the National League Central. That season also produced a National League Rookie of the Year in second baseman Jonathan India. 
In 2022, Cincinnati lost 100 games for the first time in four decades. The Reds improved to 82-80 in 2023, despite leading the major leagues with 650 games missed by players because of injuries.
This season began with high expectations that Bell and the Reds couldn’t meet. A lack of consistency was the trend throughout the season, exacerbated by injuries to key players.
During Bell’s tenure, the Reds brought along a talented core expected to put the organization back on top, including India, Hunter Greene, Elly De La Cruz and Matt McLain. But Cincinnati hasn’t been able to get over the hump. 
Bell is the third manager fired this season. The Chicago White Sox fired Pedro Grifol and three coaches on Aug. 8, just days after the team ended a 21-game losing streak that tied the American League record.
The Seattle Mariners fired Scott Servais on Aug. 22, in the middle of his ninth season with the team.

LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England kept its main interest rate unchanged at 5% Thursday despite a big cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve, its first since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic more than four years ago.
The decision was widely expected amid ongoing concerns about inflation within the bank’s monetary policy committee, particularly the elevated levels in the crucial services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy. Figures on Wednesday showed that inflation overall in the U.K. held steady at an annual rate of 2.2% in August, still above the bank’s goal.
Minutes to the meeting showed that eight of the nine members of the panel voted to keep rates unchanged, while one backed a quarter-point reduction.
“The economy has been evolving broadly as we expected. If that continues, we should be able to reduce rates gradually over time,” said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. “But it’s vital that inflation stays low, so we need to be careful not to cut too fast or by too much.”
The bank, which last month cut interest rates for the first time since the pandemic, is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again at its next meeting in November, especially as it will have details of the government’s budget on Oct. 30.
On Wednesday, the Fed cut its main interest by half of a percentage point to roughly 4.8% from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months. It also signaled that there will be more cuts to come in the next few months.


Central banks around the world dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multi-decade highs recently, they have started cutting interest rates. 
On Wednesday, the Fed became the latest major central bank to reduce borrowing costs, cutting its main interest by half of a percentage point to roughly 4.8% from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months. It also signaled that there will be more cuts to come in the next few months.
Though Thursday’s decision could be seen as bad news for borrowers, they should get some relief over the coming months, with most economists predicting that the bank will reduce its main rate to around 3.5% by the end of 2025, with a consequent reduction in the cost of personal loans and mortgage rates.
The bank is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again at its next meeting in November, especially as it will have details of the government’s budget on Oct. 30. 
The new Labour government has said that it needs to plug a 22 billion pound ($29 billion) hole in the public finances and has indicated that it may have to raise taxes and lower spending, which would likely weigh on the near-term outlook for the British economy and put downward pressure on inflation.
Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, formerly Aberdeen Asset Management, said the Bank of England “will need to incorporate any fiscal changes in its next forecasts, which could provide the foundation for more rapid cuts in due course.”",False

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Napheesa Collier was voted the WNBA Defensive Player of the Year and Cheryl Reeve earned the Coach of the Year award on Sunday.
Collier won the defensive award for the first time, receiving 36 votes from a 67-person national media panel. A’ja Wilson finished second with 26 votes.
The Lynx star ranked second in the league in steals per game (1.91). She was fourth in defensive rebounds per game (7.5) and seventh in blocks per game (1.41), finishing with career highs in both categories.
She helped Minnesota finish second in the league in defensive rating (94.8) and fewest points allowed (75.6). 
“We take a lot of pride in our defense,” Collier said. “It’s something that obviously I’ve worked hard to improve because I know it’s what’s best for the team.”
Collier led the Lynx to the second-best record in the league (30-10) under the guidance of Reeve, who won the coaching award for a record fourth time. Reeve received 62 of the 67 votes for Coach of the Year. New York’s Sandy Brondello had four votes and Indiana’s Christie Sides got one.
“I think what comes to mind this time of year is all that has gone into the season, and then for us to experience success, I think of countless hours of work in the offseason,” Reeve said.
Reeve led the U.S. women to an Olympic gold medal this summer, while three of her players — Collier (USA), Alanna Smith (Australia) and Bridget Carleton (Canada) also spent their Olympic break on the court in Paris. She credited assistant coaches Katie Smith, Rebekkah Brunson and Elaine Powell for helping to make sure the Lynx didn’t miss a beat in the second half, when they won 13 of 15 games.


“They’ve carried me,” Reeve said. “The work that they put in while we were away and Phee and Lan and Bridget came back from playing for the Olympic teams. I don’t know about them, but I was exhausted for — I’m still exhausted.”
Reeve also earned WNBA Basketball Executive of the Year for the second time. Talisa Rhea of the Seattle Storm finished second.
Reeve broke a tie with Van Chancellor of the Houston Comets (1997-99) and Mike Thibault of the Connecticut Sun and Washington Mystics (2006, 2008 and 2013), who each won coach of the year three times. Reeve was previously honored in 2011, 2016 and 2020.

Publication date:2024-09-19 07:00:00

Instagram is making teen accounts private by default as it tries to make the platform safer for children amid a growing backlash against how social media affects young people’s lives. 
Beginning Tuesday in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia, anyone under 18 who signs up for Instagram will be placed into restrictive teen accounts and those with existing accounts will be migrated over the next 60 days. Teens in the European Union will see their accounts adjusted later this year. 
Parent company Meta acknowledges that teenagers may lie about their age and says it will require them to verify their ages in more instances, like if they try to create a new account with an adult birthday. The Menlo Park, California company also said it is building technology that proactively finds teen accounts that pretend to be grownups and automatically places them into the restricted teen accounts. 
The teen accounts will be private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to. “Sensitive content,” such as videos of people fighting or those promoting cosmetic procedures, will be limited, Meta said. Teens will also get notifications if they are on Instagram for more than 60 minutes and a “sleep mode” will be enabled that turns off notifications and sends auto-replies to direct messages from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m.
While these settings will be turned on for all teens, 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to turn them off. Kids under 16 will need their parents’ permission to do so. 


“The three concerns we’re hearing from parents are that their teens are seeing content that they don’t want to see or that they’re getting contacted by people they don’t want to be contacted by or that they’re spending too much time on the app,” said Naomi Gleit, head of product at Meta. “So teen accounts is really focused on addressing those three concerns.”
The announcement comes as the company faces lawsuits from dozens of U.S. states that accuse it of harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. 
While Meta didn’t give specifics on how the changes might affect its business, the company said the changes may mean that teens will use Instagram less in the short term. Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg said the revenue impact of the changes “will likely be minimal.” 
“Even as Meta continues to prioritize teen safety, it’s unlikely that it’s going to make sweeping changes that would cause a major financial hit,” she said, adding that the teen accounts are unlikely to significantly affect how engaged teens are with Instagram “not in the least because there are still plenty of ways to circumvent the rules, and could even make them more motivated to work around the age limits.”
New York Attorney General Letitia James said Meta’s announcement was “an important first step, but much more needs to be done to ensure our kids are protected from the harms of social media.” James’ office is working with other New York officials on how to implement a new state law intended to curb children’s access to what critics call addictive social media feeds.
Others were more critical. Nicole Gill, the co-founder and executive director of the nonprofit Accountable Tech, called Instagram’s announcement the “latest attempt to avoid actual independent oversight and regulation and instead continue to self-regulate, jeopardizing the health, safety, and privacy of young people.” 
“Today’s PR exercise falls short of the safety by design and accountability that young people and their parents deserve and only meaningful policy action can guarantee,” she said. “Meta’s business model is built on addicting its users and mining their data for profit; no amount of parental and teen controls Meta is proposing will change that.” 
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), the co-author of the Kids Online Safety Act that recently passed the Senate, questioned the timing of the announcement “on the eve of a House markup” of the bill. 
“Just like clockwork, the Kids Online Safety Act moves forward and industry comes out with a new set of self-enforcing guidelines,” she said.
In the past, Meta’s efforts at addressing teen safety and mental health on its platforms have also been met with criticism that the changes don’t go far enough. For instance, while kids will get a notification when they’ve spent 60 minutes on the app, they will be able to bypass it and continue scrolling. 
That’s unless the child’s parents turn on “parental supervision” mode, where parents can limit teens’ time on Instagram to a specific amount of time, such as 15 minutes. 
With the latest changes, Meta is giving parents more options to oversee their kids’ accounts. Those under 16 will need a parent or guardian’s permission to change their settings to less restrictive ones. They can do this by setting up “parental supervision” on their accounts and connecting them to a parent or guardian. 
Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said last week that parents don’t use the parental controls the company has introduced in recent years.
Meta’s Gleit said she thinks the teen accounts will incentivize parents to start using them.
“Parents will be able to see, via the family center, who is messaging their teen and hopefully have a conversation with their teen,” she said. “If there is bullying or harassment happening, parents will have visibility into who their teen’s following, who’s following their teen, who their teen has messaged in the past seven days and hopefully have some of these conversations and help them navigate these really difficult situations online.” 
U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that tech companies put too much responsibility on parents when it comes to keeping children safe on social media. 
“We’re asking parents to manage a technology that’s rapidly evolving that fundamentally changes how their kids think about themselves, how they build friendships, how they experience the world — and technology, by the way, that prior generations never had to manage,” Murthy said in May 2023.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — A’ja Wilson scored 30 points and had 14 rebounds, Chelsea Gray added 13 points and 10 assists and the Las Vegas Aces beat Chicago 90-71 on Tuesday night, handing the Sky their seventh straight loss.
Chicago’s loss, and Atlanta’s loss in Phoenix, clinched playoff spots for the Mercury and the idle Indiana Fever.
Tiffany Hayes, who stepped into the starting lineup for Kelsey Plum while she rested a sore ankle, added 20 points for the Aces (21-12), while Jackie Young had 15.
Wilson’s eighth game this season with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds helped Las Vegas stay a game up on Seattle for the fourth playoff spot and homecourt advantage in the first round. Wilson also had three blocks, three assists and two steals and did not commit a foul.
She has now scored 139 points in her last four games, tying Maya Moore for the most in a four game WNBA stretch. Moore did it for Minnesota 10 years ago.
The game was played at T-Mobile Arena instead of the Aces’ usual home arena at Mandalay Bay and drew 18,394 fans, the second-best home attendance in franchise history.
Michaela Onyenwere had 15 points to lead Chicago, which remains tied with Atlanta for the final playoff spot, one game ahead of Washington. Kamilla Cardoso added 14 points, Dana Evans had 13 off the bench and Angel Reese extended her rookie record for double-doubles to 25 with 12 points and 16 rebounds.
The Aces led 47-31 at halftime but the Sky wouldn’t fold. Evans hit a 3-pointer with 3:58 to play to cut the deficit to 78-68. Wilson scored the next six points as the Aces pulled away.


The Aces led 17-13 after one quarter and then scored 13 straight to open the second. Gray scored seven points in the surge and had assists on the other three baskets.
Las Vegas took a 68-51 lead into the fourth quarter as Young had four points to start a closing 8-2 surge.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Jalen Milroe and Alabama were locked in a surprising struggle for 50 minutes. The fun began for them when the miscues stopped.
Milroe ran for two touchdowns and threw for a pair of fourth-quarter scores to help the fourth-ranked Crimson Tide ultimately pull away to beat South Florida 42-16 on Saturday night. 
The Crimson Tide (2-0) couldn’t produce any breathing room against the Bulls (1-1) before exploding for 28 points in the final 10 minutes. It had turned into a surprising test for new coach Kalen DeBoer, whose team came in as 30-point favorites and didn’t come to life offensively until late.
“In the fourth quarter, staying away from the penalties and turnovers, it’s amazing what can happen,” DeBoer said.
Alabama lost three second-half fumbles and had an array of penalties, entering the fourth up just 14-13. Then Milroe had touchdown passes of 16 yards to Kobe Prentiss and 43 yards to Ryan Williams. Jamarion Miller added a 56-yard touchdown run and Justice Haynes had a 29-yarder in the final 2:30. 
Miller finished with 140 yards rushing. 
The Bulls bedeviled Alabama’s offense much of the way for the second straight year, this time with Milroe on the field. The Tide quarterback was benched for last year’s game, which was tied at the half before Alabama won 17-3.
Milroe led Alabama to 10 straight wins and a Southeastern Conference championship after that.


“This isn’t a wakeup call or nothing like that,” DeBoer said. “It’s nothing like that. It’s just keep raising the standard. I think this game last year was an important one that propelled them last year and it may be the same this year. That’s my hope.”
Milroe completed 17 of 27 passes for 199 yards but was sacked four times and lost a fumble from under center at the South Florida 2 in the second half.
Milroe’s first TD pass gave the Tide a 21-13 lead. The Bulls answered with John Collins’ third field goal on a drive propelled by Nay’Quan Wright’s two 19-yard runs and a targeting penalty against Justin Jefferson.
“We did for three and half quarters exactly what we needed to do defensively,” South Florida coach Alex Golesh said.
Milroe hit the freshman Williams, who spun away from a defender and scampered into the end zone for his third touchdown of 40-plus yards in two college games.
“Just to see the guys have tremendous grit and pull out a win like that, it just shows the toughness and the want-to,” Milroe said. 
Alabama lost two fumbles in its own territory in the first 4:05 of the second half, and Milroe later lost another.
His South Florida counterpart Byrum Brown passed for 103 yards and ran 23 times for another 108.
“That’s where we are as a program,” Golesh said. “That’s the last step of our growth is to go finish that game.”
South Florida: Put on a mostly competitive show in front of the biggest crowd (officially 100,077) to attend a Bulls game. Could have made it even closer but produced no points on two straight possessions near midfield to open the second half.
Alabama: The second game of DeBoer’s tenure was nowhere near as pristine as the debut, a 63-0 win over Western Kentucky. It included 13 penalties for 120 yards, plus the turnovers.
Alabama left tackle Kadyn Proctor missed his second straight game with a left shoulder injury. Tyler Booker moved over from left guard and was replaced by backup right guard Geno VanDeMark. VanDeMark and right tackle Wilkin Formby were called for a combined five holding penalties by halftime, with both having a flag negate touchdowns. One of those against Formby didn’t count on the stats for off-setting penalties, but he drew another flag in the second half.
Alabama had 183 total yards in the first three quarters and 210 in the final one. The fourth-quarter scoring drives took four plays, three plays, two plays and finally just one.
Alabama seems likely to stay put in the rankings, especially after the late surge extended it to a more impressive final margin.
South Florida: At Southern Mississippi on Saturday.
Alabama: At Wisconsin on Saturday.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Georgia and Alabama, Jalen Milroe and Carson Beck, put on quite a show even with a different Crimson Tide coach prowling the sideline.
Ryan Williams caught a 75-yard touchdown pass from Milroe with 2:18 left and No. 4 Alabama beat No. 2 Georgia 41-34 on Saturday night in a wild Southeastern Conference debut for Tide coach Kalen DeBoer.
Then, Alabama’s other freshman sporting a No. 2 jersey, defensive back Zabien Brown, intercepted Carson Beck’s pass in the end zone to secure the victory.
“We pushed each other to the very end,” DeBoer said. 
That’s no surprise with two teams that have battled for SEC and even national supremacy almost annually. It was DeBoer’s initiation into a captivating rivalry of SEC powers that added another memorable chapter, even without Nick Saban on the sideline opposite protege Kirby Smart of Georgia.
The postgame message from DeBoer wasn’t all that different. 
“We expect to win these games,” he said. “Of course the locker room is full of excitement but I also want to make sure they realize that’s the expectation. There’s a lot of season left.”
The dynamic 17-year-old Williams turned back to grab Milroe’s deep pass in tight coverage, did a quick spin and sprinted down the right sideline. Milroe then hit Germie Bernard for the two-point conversion for the Tide (4-0, 1-0).
“I did a spin move and it was like in slow motion,” Williams said. “It looked faster on the screen.”


It was fast enough.
The long TD pass came one play and 13 seconds after Carson Beck’s 67-yard bomb to Dillon Bell gave the Bulldogs (3-1, 1-1) their first lead of the game.
A rematch of last season’s SEC Championship Game, also won by Alabama, turned into a scintillating quarterback duel.
Milroe completed 27 of 33 passes for 374 yards with two touchdowns and an interception that bounced off the receiver. He also ran for 117 yards and a pair of TDs. Williams had six catches for 177 yards.
Beck was 27 of 50 passing for 439 yards with three touchdowns. He also threw three interceptions in the first multi-interception game of his career but put on a show in the second half.
Beck is 16-2 as a starter with both losses coming to the Tide.
The Bulldogs scored three touchdowns over the final 9:46. Alabama got the only one it needed.
Milroe led Alabama to touchdowns on its first four drives against a defense that stood as the only one in FBS not to allow one coming into the game.
“Obviously, we were not really prepared and that falls on me in the first half,” said Smart, who is just 1-6 against Alabama while dominating almost everyone else. 
The Bulldogs were down 28-0 a few minutes into the second quarter, their streaks of 42 consecutive regular-season victories and 28 straight regular-season SEC wins seemingly all but over by halftime.
Georgia and Beck fought way back instead of folding.
“The first half, we played terrible,” Beck said. “I don’t think we need to watch the film to go see that we didn’t play our best. You know, that starts with me. I;ve got to be better. 
“But I’m happy about how we fought, we brought it all the way back and took the lead, just weren’t able to close it out.”
Georgia: Has looked vulnerable for a program that has won two of the last three national titles in the last two games, including a 13-12 victory over Kentucky. But the Bulldogs showed they haven’t gone anywhere with the dominant second half.
Alabama: The Tide have so far shown no signs of slippage under DeBoer, especially offensively, rolling on the road against Wisconsin and surviving at home against their recent SEC nemesis.
Alabama will jump at least one spot in the AP poll. The Bulldogs’ second-half play probably means they won’t fall far.
Former President Donald Trump, the current Republican candidate, was on hand for the game. Trump was introduced early in the second quarter, drawing chants of “USA! USA!” and waving to the crowd from a luxury box.
Georgia went for it five times on fourth down and made them all. That helped make up from a 3-of-15 performance on third down.
Alabama: At Vanderbilt on Saturday in its first SEC road game.
Georgia: Hosts struggling Auburn on Saturday.

MADRID (AP) — Ángel Correa scored in stoppage time and Atletico Madrid drew 1-1 with Real Madrid in a tense Spanish league derby that was interrupted for more than 15 minutes in the second half after Atletico fans threw objects onto the field.
Correa equalized for Atletico in a breakaway five minutes into added time with a goal that was initially disallowed for offside but was awarded after video review. Éder Militão had given Madrid the lead in the 64th. 
The draw left Madrid in second place, three points behind leader Barcelona, which lost 4-2 to Osasuna on Saturday to end its seven-game winning streak. Atletico was third, two points behind Madrid after eight rounds.
“I always think positively,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “We moved closer to the leader and we have been playing well.”
The derby was interrupted shortly after Madrid’s goal at the Metropolitano, with the referee sending the players to the locker rooms after Atletico fans kept throwing objects onto the field.
Militão had celebrated near the sideline in front of Atletico fans, and Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was seen appearing to provoke Atletico fans after Militão scored.
“What the fans did wasn’t right but we are not helping when we provoke them,” Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. “I’m not justifying what the fans did, but we need to help as well.” 
It was Courtois who alerted the referee about the objects — including lighters — being thrown onto the field near him.


Atletico defender José María Giménez and midfielder Koke Resurrección went to talk to the fans in the section behind Courtois’ goal. That section is where usually the more radical Atletico supporters are located. Atletico coach Diego Simeone also asked several times for the fans to behave.
A message over the stadium loudspeakers said the match was being interrupted for 15 minutes, and that it would be suspended if the problem continued. 
The interruption came a day after the Spanish league said it would ask police to act against the promoters of a social media campaign which the league said was aimed at promoting racist acts against Madrid star Vinícius Júnior at the derby. 
The social media campaign was based on a hashtag encouraging Atletico fans to wear face masks, apparently to make it more difficult for authorities to identify individuals who participate in racist chants or insults.
Social media videos showed Atletico fans before the match chanting “Vinícius is different.”
Vinícius occasionally clashed with Atletico players at the Metropolitano.
Atletico’s Marcos Llorente was sent off in stoppage time.
Fourth-place 10-man Athletic Bilbao conceded a stoppage-time equalizer in a 1-1 draw with Sevilla at home, while Giovani Lo Celso scored an 85th-minute goal in Real Betis’ 1-0 home win over Espanyol. 
Iago Aspas got an 81st-minute equalizer for Celta Vigo in a 1-1 draw against visiting Girona.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Calling it “unserious and unacceptable,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries rejected on Monday a proposal from Speaker Mike Johnson that links continued government funding for six months with a measure to require proof of citizenship when registering to vote.
The response frames the spending battle to come over the next weeks as lawmakers work to reach consensus on a short-term spending bill that would prevent a partial government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. Lawmakers hope to avoid a shutdown just weeks before voters go to the polls.
Johnson is punting the final decisions on full-year spending into next year when a new president and Congress take over. He’s doing so at the urging of members within his conference who believe that Republicans will be in a better position next year to secure the funding and policy priorities they want. 
But Democrats said the appropriations process should be wrapped up by this Congress, and the short-term measure should reflect that. It also needs to be free of “partisan policy changes,” Jeffries said.
“There is no other viable path forward that protects the health, safety and economic well-being of hardworking American taxpayers,” Jeffries wrote in a letter to House Democrats released Monday.
Lawmakers are returning to Washington this week following a traditional August recess spent mostly working in their home states and districts. They are not close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that will fund the agencies during the next fiscal year, so they’ll need to approve a stopgap measure.
AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports that Congress returns to work today with a controversial government spending bill coming up for a vote this week.


Johnson’s proposal is not only running into resistance from Democrats, but it was clear Monday night that there are also some in the GOP conference who won’t vote for any stopgap bill, let alone one they say spends too much. Johnson can afford to lose only four dissenters from within his conference if Democrats are united in opposition.
“We need to stop spending at a level that is untenable for the American people,” said Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., who also predicted the bill would not have the votes to pass.
The House bill including the proof of citizenship mandate for voter registration complicates the effort. The voter registration measure is popular with House Republicans and has already passed once before in that chamber. The House Freedom Caucus, which generally includes the chamber’s most conservative members, called for it to be attached to the spending bill. But Democrats are overwhelmingly opposed.
Republicans say that requiring proof of citizenship would ensure that U.S. elections are only for American citizens, improving confidence in the nation’s federal election system, something that former President Donald Trump has sought to undermine over the years. 
Opponents say it is already against the law for noncitizens to vote in federal elections and that the document requirements would disenfranchise millions of Americans who do not have the necessary documents readily available when they get a chance to register.
Trump and other Republicans have revved up their complaints about the issue of noncitizens voting with the influx of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border under President Joe Biden’s administration. They are contending Democrats let them in to add them to the voter rolls. But the available evidence shows that noncitizen voting in federal elections is incredibly rare. 
Johnson called the proof of citizenship mandate a “righteous fight” as he entered the Capitol Monday afternoon. He said that even if a small percentage of people who have entered the U.S. illegally end up registering to vote, “they can throw the election. This is serious business.”
Senate Democrats have also come out against Johnson’s proposal. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the bill “pure partisan posturing.” 
“Speaker Johnson knows deep down that he needs to work with Democrats to get anything done,” Schumer said.
The White House said that if the bill reached Biden’s desk he will veto it. The veto threat said states already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters’ eligibility and maintain accurate voter rolls. 
“Instead of working in a bipartisan manner to keep the Government open and provide emergency funding for disaster needs, House Republicans have chosen brinksmanship,” the White House statement said.
The bill does provide an additional $10 billion for a disaster relief fund administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But the White House said it did not cover the full amount needed through other disaster relief programs, such as for highways and bridges damaged by disasters in 38 states.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned that long-term continuing resolutions, such as the current one before the House this week, harm military readiness. Austin said in a letter to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees that, if passed, the bill would mark the second year in a row and the seventh time in the past 15 years that the department is delayed in moving forward with some critical priorities. 
“These actions subject Service members and their families to unnecessary stress, empower our adversaries, misalign billions of dollars, damage our readiness, and impede our ability to react to emergent events,” Austin wrote.

Publication date:2024-09-23 07:00:00

The Massachusetts attorney general has named a veteran trial attorney to lead an outside investigation into the death of a state police recruit following a training exercise earlier this month.
Enrique Delgado-Garcia, 25, of Worcester, died at a hospital on Sept. 13, a day after the exercise in the boxing ring at the Massachusetts State Police Academy in New Braintree, in Worcester County, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Boston.
Delgado-Garcia was wearing boxing gloves and headgear during the exercise. The medical team determined he required urgent care and took him to the hospital, where he died. 
The Massachusetts State Police also said Monday that they have suspended full-contact boxing training activities among recruits until further notice.
Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell named David Meier to lead an independent investigation into Delgado-Garcia’s death.
Meier has worked as a trial attorney for over 30 years. In 2012-2013, he served as special counsel to then-Gov. Deval Patrick, overseeing the investigation into individuals potentially harmed by misconduct at a state drug lab. Meier had also served as chief of homicide in the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office.
“Mr. Meier has deep experience in death investigations and will ensure independence and integrity in this matter,” Campbell said.
Campbell said Meier will have complete authority to select his own investigative team and make his own decisions about the facts, evidence and course of the investigation. The Massachusetts State Police will have no role in the investigative team or decision-making process, she said.


Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said Delgado-Garcia’s family and the public deserve answers.
“I will be instructing new Col. Geoff Noble to review academy training and policy practices to ensure they best serve the men and women of the State Police,” said Healey, referencing the person recently named to replace Col. John Mawn Jr. as head of the state police in October.
Healey told reporters earlier Monday that she’ll ask Noble to conduct an independent review of the academy’s programs and trainings to make sure they are as strong as possible.
The manner and cause of death for Delgado-Garcia have not been released. Family members told reporters that he suffered broken teeth and a neck fracture.
“The Academy suspended full-contact boxing training activities between trainees until further notice,” Tim McGuirk, a state police department spokesperson, said in a statement Sunday night. 
On the day of the exercise, Mawn requested an investigation by the agency’s detective unit that is assigned to the Worcester County District Attorney’s office, McGuirk said. 
Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said last week that he will name another agency to investigate because of a conflict of interest. Delgado-Garcia worked in his office as a victim witness advocate before joining the state police training program in April. 
“The department is fully cooperating with investigatory authorities and urges the Worcester County District Attorney’s Office to name an independent investigator as soon as possible,” McGuirk said. 
Mawn also directed the state police’s Division of Standards and Training “to comprehensively review the Academy’s defensive tactics program,” McGuirk said. 
“That review remains ongoing and will ensure that the program delivers relevant skills safely and effectively to those preparing to become troopers,” he said. 
The review is assessing safety protocols, training methods and curriculum, as well as medical and health considerations, he said. It is soliciting feedback from recruits, instructors, and others. 
Details on the boxing training exercise Delgado-Garcia participated in have not been released.
The boxing training has been part of a 25-week, paramilitary-style curriculum that is “both physically and mentally demanding,” the academy says on its website. “While it’s designed to be challenging, it isn’t meant to be impossible.” 
Delgado-Garcia’s class is scheduled to graduate Oct. 9. He was administered the oath of office by state police in the final hours of his life.
Born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, Delgado-Garcia came to Worcester as a young boy, according to his obituary. He received a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Westfield State University in Springfield, Massachusetts. 
“Enrique was an exceptional young man who devoted himself to the service of others,” the obituary said. “He had always dreamed of becoming a state trooper and to be someone big who made a difference in the lives of the people in his community.”

CINCINNATI (AP) — The Cincinnati Reds fired manager David Bell on Sunday night after six seasons.
The team announced the move hours after a 2-0 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, and named bench coach Freddie Benavides as interim manager for the final five games of the season.
“David provided the kind of steadiness that we needed in our clubhouse over the last few seasons. We felt a change was needed to move the Major League team forward. We have not achieved the success we expected, and we need to begin focusing on 2025,” President of Baseball Operations Nick Krall said on a statement posted on the Reds’ website.
With a week left in the season, the Reds are 76-81 and in fourth place in the NL Central, 13 1/2 games behind division champion Milwaukee. Cincinnati closes out the season with five road games. The Reds have a two-game series in Cleveland on Tuesday and Wednesday before closing out the campaign with three games in Chicago against the Cubs. 
The 52-year-old Bell — whose grandfather Gus and father Buddy both spent part of their careers playing in Cincinnati — was hired by the Reds in October 2018. He had a 409-456 record over six seasons.
Under Bell in 2020, the Reds earned a postseason berth in his second season, which was shortened by COVID-19 to 60 games.
The Reds finished the 2021 season with a respectable 83-79 record, good enough for third place in the National League Central. That season also produced a National League Rookie of the Year in second baseman Jonathan India. 


In 2022, Cincinnati lost 100 games for the first time in four decades. The Reds improved to 82-80 in 2023, despite leading the major leagues with 650 games missed by players because of injuries.
This season began with high expectations that Bell and the Reds couldn’t meet. An eight-game losing streak in May put them five games under .500. They strung together seven wins in a row in June to get them back to one game under .500 but couldn’t sustain the success. 
That lack of consistency would be a trend for the rest of the season.
The Reds swept the Yankees in a three-game series in New York July 2-4 but again faded. They looked as if they could make a postseason run when an Aug. 12-14 sweep of the Cardinals improved their record to 60-61 as they moved into a tie for second place in the NL Central with St. Louis and within a half dozen games of a wild-card spot.
But consistency was a problem again, and Bell lost three of his top starting pitchers, Hunter Greene, Nick Lodolo and Andrew Abbott, to injuries. Cincinnati is 12-8 in September. 
During Bell’s tenure, the Reds brought along a talented core expected to put the organization back on top, including India, Greene, Elly De La Cruz and Matt McLain. But Cincinnati hasn’t been able to get over the hump. 
Bell becomes the third manager fired this season. The Chicago White Sox fired Pedro Grifol and three coaches on Aug. 8, just days after the team ended a 21-game losing streak that tied the American League record.
The Seattle Mariners fired Scott Servais on Aug. 22, in the middle of his ninth season with the team.
Krall plans to speak to the media on Monday at Great American Ball Park.

OAK PARK, Mich. (AP) — Bugs in a library — again.
The Oak Park Public Library in suburban Detroit was closed Wednesday for a scrubbing after bedbugs were found in two chairs in the computer area. A library nearby in Royal Oak was closed Sunday and part of Monday after staff said unwanted visitors crawled out of a just-returned DVD case. 
The library in Oak Park will reopen Thursday.
“We feel that taking every available action to ensure our public spaces are safe, comfortable and accessible for both our staff and community members goes without question here,” the library said on Facebook.
Bedbugs were confirmed to be in chairs that were swiftly removed from the Oak Park library on Tuesday. Pest experts found no evidence of other bugs, but the library still decided to clean the building.

PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) — Pope Francis called Saturday for the Catholic Church in Papua New Guinea to be particularly close to women who have been abused and marginalized, speaking out in a country where violence against women is reported to be more than twice the global average.
Francis heard first-hand about the plight of women during his first full day in the South Pacific nation. A nun told him of the church’s work caring for women who have been attacked and accused of witchcraft and sorcery, and then shunned by their families.
“I think too of the marginalized and wounded, both morally and physically, by prejudice and superstition sometimes to the point of having to risk their lives,” Francis said. He urged the church to be particularly close to such people on the peripheries, with “closeness, compassion and tenderness.”

According to U.N. Women, 60% of Papua New Guinea’s women have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner at some time in their lives, double the global average. Allegations of sorcery against women are common. Papua New Guinea ranked 151 out of 166 countries on the U.N. Development Program’s gender inequality index in 2022.
Francis amended his remarks throughout the day to include reference to women after the governor general of Papua New Guinea, Bob Dadae, welcomed him to Papua New Guinea by calling for greater protection of women and respect for their rights.


Women “are the ones who carry the country forward, they give life, build and grow a country,” Francis said in his first ad-libbed speech to political leaders and diplomats. “Let us not forget the women who are on the front line of human and spiritual development.”
The issue of women and inequality is particularly fraught for the Catholic Church, given women are barred from the priesthood and are often treated as second-class citizens by the all-male hierarchy. Francis has denounced gender-based violence, appointed women to top Vatican positions and called for women to have greater decision-making roles in the church, but he has still reaffirmed the ban on women’s ordination.
It was an improvised first day of Francis’ visit, the second leg of a four-nation journey through Southeast Asia and Oceania that represents the longest and most challenging of his pontificate.
Dancers in swishing grass skirts performed for Francis to the thump-thump-thump of drums as he presided over a mix of political and church business. In his opening remarks, he called for an end to the tribal violence that has troubled the country for decades and for equitable, sustainable extraction of its resources.
Francis marveled at the diversity of Papua New Guinea’s people — there are some 800 languages spoken here — saying their variety must be “a challenge to the Holy Spirit, who creates harmony amid differences!”

But he also noted that such diversity has long created conflict, a reference to the tribal violence over land and other disputes that have long characterized the country’s culture but have grown more lethal in recent years. Francis appealed for a sense of civic responsibility and cooperation to prevail, to benefit everyone.
“It is my particular hope that tribal violence will come to an end, for it causes many victims, prevents people from living in peace and hinders development,” he said.
But the issue of women as victims of violence and discrimination, including within the church, punctuated Francis’ day, including when Francis met with local priests and nuns gathered at a Marian sanctuary.
Sister Lorena Jenal told Francis about an organization, House of Hope, that provides shelter to women accused of witchcraft and sorcery and works with community leaders to try to change attitudes about women.
She told him about one woman who was nearly burned to death and was shunned by her family, but was eventually welcomed back after the church intervened.
A Catholic mother of three, Grace Wrakia, addressed the gathering about her experience being named to participate in Francis’ big meeting in Rome last year on the future of the Catholic Church, where women were given equal voice and a vote for the first time in Vatican conversations.
She said the church in Papua New Guinea “should develop and use more of such conversation methods so that the wisdom of the simple people in our peripheries may be heard, respected and valued.”
“I long to see more men and women as partners,” she said. 
A nun with the Sisters of Charity, Sister Genevie, was in the pews with other sisters and acknowledged the problem of violence and discrimination was real.
“In our country, men, they still hold onto leadership,” she told The Associated Press. “Mother Teresa told us to help the women.”
On his first day, Francis also called for fair and environmentally sustainable extraction of Papua New Guinea’s vast natural resources, which include gold, nickel and natural gas. 
Francis, who has written entire encyclicals about the environment, has long insisted that development of natural resources must benefit local people, not just the multinational companies that extract them. 
“These environmental and cultural treasures represent at the same time a great responsibility, because they require everyone, civil authorities and all citizens, to promote initiatives that develop natural and human resources in a sustainable and equitable manner,” he said.
Finally, Francis called for a “definitive solution” to the question of Bougainville, an island region whose people voted overwhelmingly to become independent from Papua New Guinea in 2019. The outcome of the nonbinding referendum has not been implemented.
Despite the rigors of the trip and jet lag — Papua New Guinea is eight hours ahead of Rome time — the 87-year-old Francis appeared in relatively good form, though he coughed throughout the day. He smiled and laughed as he handed out candies to young children who had performed for him, and even took a turn playing a kundu drum, a traditional hand-held hourglass-shaped drum that one group of children gave him.
He was warmly welcomed by crowds outside at each of his stops, with people young and old dressed in traditional grass skirts, face paint and headdresses dancing and singing. And several South Pacific leaders came to Port Moresby for the rare chance to greet the pope, including the prime minister of Vanuatu, the president of Nauru and the prime minister of Tonga.
Francis is the second pope to visit Papua New Guinea, after St. John Paul II visited first in 1984, then in 1995 to beatify Peter To Rot, a Catholic layman who was declared a martyr for the faith after he died in prison during World War II.

Publication date:2024-09-08 07:00:00

DETROIT (AP) — Matthew Stafford led 31 fourth-quarter comebacks with the Detroit Lions.
On Sunday night, he nearly got one against them.
“There was a lot of adversity that we had to overcome,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “We gave ourselves a chance, but we just fell short.”
Playing behind a makeshift offensive line, Stafford, who played 12 seasons for Detroit, helped Los Angeles overcome a 17-3 deficit. His 9-yard touchdown pass to Cooper Kupp gave the Rams a 20-17 lead with 4:35 to play, but the Lions ultimately won 26-20 in overtime.
After the Rams went ahead, the defense forced Jared Goff and the Lions into a three-and-out, giving Stafford the ball back at the 11-yard line with 4:10 to go.
Three plays later, he hit Demarcus Robinson for 6 yards on third-and-5 to keep the drive going. The Lions had to start using timeouts, and the Rams were close to clinching a Week 1 victory.
Stafford’s offensive line was riddled with injuries, though. A pair of holding penalties on backup tackle A.J. Arcuri cost the Rams in the red zone, including one that took a touchdown off the board. And on second-and-12 with 2:31 to go, a false start by Warren McClendon Jr., the other reserve tackle, pushed the Rams back 5 yards as they tried to close out the game.
Following the false start, Robinson took an end-around 7 yards, giving the Rams a third-and-10 from the 22 with 2:26 left, but Stafford narrowly missed Kupp on what would have been a massive first down.


“There were just some unfortunate things that happened,” Stafford said.
At the end of the game, the Rams were missing three starting offensive linemen — a position where they were already banged up — and No. 2 wide receiver Puka Nacua, who left with a knee injury.

Kupp did his part, catching 14 passes for 110 yards, but Stafford didn’t have Nacua when he was under pressure.
He didn’t blame the offensive line, though.
“We were already kind of thin up there, and I was proud of the guys who were playing,” he said. “They never blinked.”
After Stafford missed Kupp, the Lions extended the game. Goff drove them into position for the tying field goal with 20 seconds left in regulation, then Detroit won the coin toss in overtime.
Detroit took eight plays — seven runs and a pass to running back Jahmyr Gibbs — to win 26-20 on David Montgomery’s 1-yard rush.
“This is an opportunity for us to move forward the right way,” McVay said. “Tonight was a good indicator of the mental and physical toughness of this group.”
McVay had no interest in second-guessing one of his bigger decisions. In the second quarter, with the game tied at 3, McVay went for it on fourth-and-4 from the Lions 23 instead of trying a 40-yard field goal.
Kupp couldn’t make the catch, and the Rams lost out on points that could have made a huge difference down the stretch in another close loss to the Lions.
“That’s why we came up short the last time,” McVay said, referring to the Rams kicking three field goals in a 24-23 playoff loss to Detroit in January.
McVay didn’t have updates on his offense’s injuries and wasn’t sure if Nacua had aggravated the knee injury he dealt with in training camp.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Seventeen people, including 15 women, were killed in two mass shootings that took place at two homes on the same street in a rural town in South Africa, police said Saturday.
A search was underway for the suspects, national police spokesperson Brig. Athlenda Mathe said in a statement. The victims were 15 women and two men, she said. One other person was in critical condition in the hospital.
That person was among four women, a man and a 2-month-old baby who survived one of the shootings. Authorities didn’t immediately give any details on the age or gender of the person in critical condition or the medical conditions of the other survivors.
The shootings took place Friday night in the town of Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape province in southeastern South Africa. 
Three women and a man were killed in the first shootings at a home, where there were no survivors, police said. Twelve women and a man were killed at a separate home a short time later. The survivors were present at those second shootings. The shootings occurred late Friday night or in the early hours of Saturday, police said.
Video released by police from the scene showed a collection of rural homesteads along a dirt road on the outskirts of the town. Residents sat on the edge of the road as police and forensic investigators blocked off areas with yellow and black crime scene tape and began their investigations.
National police commissioner Gen. Fannie Masemola said he had ordered a specialist team of detectives be deployed from the administrative capital, Pretoria, to help with the investigation.


“A manhunt has been launched to apprehend those behind these heinous killings,” police spokesperson Mathe said. 
Local media reported that the people were attending a family gathering at the time of the shooting, but police gave no indication of any possible motive, nor how many shooters there were and what type of guns were used. Police were treating the shootings as connected, however.
Police minister Senzo Mchunu said at a press conference later Saturday that it was an “intolerably huge number” of people killed and those responsible “can’t escape justice.”
“We have full faith and confidence in the team that has been deployed to crack this case and find these criminals. Either they hand themselves over or we will fetch them ourselves,” Mchunu said.
South Africa, a country of 62 million, has one of the highest homicide rates in the world. It recorded 12,734 homicides in the first six months of this year, according to official crime statistics from the police. That’s an average of more than 70 a day. Firearms were by far the biggest cause of deaths in those cases.
Mass shootings have become increasingly common in recent years, sometimes targeting people in their homes. Ten members of the same family, including seven women and a 13-year-old boy, were killed in a mass shooting at their home in the neighboring KwaZulu-Natal province in April 2023.
Sixteen people were fatally shot in a bar in the Johannesburg township of Soweto in 2022, the worst mass shooting in South Africa in decades before the latest killings in Lusikisiki.
Firearm laws are reasonably strict in South Africa, but authorities have often pointed to the large number of illegal, unregistered guns in circulation as a major problem. Authorities sometimes hold what they call firearm amnesties, where people can hand over illegal guns to police without being prosecuted.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans are pointing to newly released immigration enforcement data to bolster their argument that the Biden administration is letting migrants who have committed serious crimes go free in the U.S. But the numbers have been misconstrued without key context.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement released data to Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales in response to a request he made for information about people under ICE supervision either convicted of crimes or facing criminal charges. Gonzales’ Texas district includes an 800-mile stretch bordering Mexico.
Gonzales posted the numbers online and they immediately became a flashpoint in the presidential campaign between former President Donald Trump, who has vowed to carry out mass deportations, and Vice President Kamala Harris. Immigration — and the Biden administration’s record on border security — has become a key issue in the election.
Here’s a look at the data and what it does or doesn’t show:
As of July 21, ICE said 662,556 people under its supervision were either convicted of crimes or face criminal charges. Nearly 15,000 were in its custody, but the vast majority — 647,572 — were not.
Included in the figures of people not detained by ICE were people found guilty of very serious crimes: 13,099 for homicide, 15,811 for sexual assault, 13,423 for weapons offenses and 2,663 for stolen vehicles. The single biggest category was for traffic-related offenses at 77,074, followed by assault at 62,231 and dangerous drugs at 56,533.


The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, later clarified that the numbers span decades — including the Trump administration and other presidencies — and that those not in its custody may be detained by a state or local agency. It’s a distinction ICE didn’t make in its report to Gonzales.

“When we speak of somebody who is not detained, we mean not detained in ICE custody. The individual could be in Folsom State Prison, for example,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday. 
Millions of people are on ICE’s “non-detained docket,” or people under the agency’s supervision who aren’t in its custody. Many are awaiting outcomes of their cases in immigration court, including some wearing monitoring devices. Others have been released after completing their prison sentences because their countries won’t take them back.
Republicans pointed to the data as proof that the Biden administration is letting immigrants with criminal records into the country and isn’t doing enough to kick out those who commit crimes while they’re here.
“The truth is clear — illegal immigrants with a criminal record are coming into our country. The data released by ICE is beyond disturbing, and it should be a wake-up call for the Biden-Harris administration and cities across the country that hide behind sanctuary policies,” Gonzales said in a news release, referring to pledges by local officials to limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
Trump, who has repeatedly portrayed immigrants as bringing lawlessness and crime to America, tweeted multiple screenshots of the data with the words: “13,000 CROSSED THE BORDER WITH MURDER CONVICTIONS.”
He also asserted that the numbers correspond to Biden and Harris’ time in office.
The data was being misinterpreted, Homeland Security said in a statement Sunday.
“The data goes back decades; it includes individuals who entered the country over the past 40 years or more, the vast majority of whose custody determination was made long before this Administration,” the agency said. “It also includes many who are under the jurisdiction or currently incarcerated by federal, state or local law enforcement partners.”
Mayorkas said it was “unfortunate” the information didn’t come with proper explanation, saying that “lends itself to misinterpretation, either deliberate or otherwise.” 
The department also stressed what it has done to deport those without the right to stay in America, saying it had removed or returned more than 700,000 people in the past year, which it said was the highest number since 2010. Homeland Security said it had removed 180,000 people with criminal convictions since President Joe Biden took office.
The data isn’t only listing people who entered the country during the Biden administration but includes people going back decades who came during previous administrations, said Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was the predecessor to ICE. 
They’re accused or convicted of committing crimes in America as opposed to committing crimes in other countries and then entering the U.S., said Meissner, who is now director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.
“This is not something that is a function of what the Biden administration did,” she said. “Certainly, this includes the Biden years, but this is an accumulation of many years, and certainly going back to at least 2010, 2011, 2012.”
A 2017 report by Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General says that as of August 2016, ICE had about 368,574 people on its non-detained docket who were convicted criminals. By June 2021, shortly after Trump left office, that number was up to 405,786.
ICE has limited resources. The number of people it supervises has skyrocketed, while its staffing has not. As the agency noted in a 2023 end-of-year report, it often has to send staff to help at the border, taking them away from their normal duties. 
The number of people ICE supervises but who aren’t in its custody has grown from 3.3 million a little before Biden took office to a little over 7 million last spring.
“The simple answer is that as a system, we haven’t devoted enough resources to the parts of the government that deal with monitoring and ultimately removing people who are deportable,” Meissner said.
ICE also has logistical and legal limits on who they can hold. Its budget allows the agency to hold 41,500 people at a time. John Sandweg, who was acting ICE director from 2013 to 2014 under then-President Barack Obama, said holding people accused or convicted of the most serious crimes is always the top priority. 
But once someone has a final order of removal — meaning a court has found that they don’t have the right to stay in the country — they cannot be held in detention forever while ICE works out how to get them home. A 2001 Supreme Court ruling essentially prevented ICE from holding those people for more than six months if there is no reasonable chance to expect they can be sent back. 
Not every country is willing to take back their citizens, Sandweg said. 
He said he suspects that a large number of those convicted of homicide but not held by ICE are people who were ordered deported but the agency can’t remove them because their home country won’t take them back. 
“It’s a very common scenario. Even amongst the countries that take people back, they can be very selective about who they take back,” he said.
The U.S. also could run into problems deporting people to countries with which it has tepid relations.
Homeland Security did not respond to questions about how many countries won’t take back their citizens. The 2017 watchdog report put the number at 23 countries, plus an additional 62 that were cooperative but where there were delays getting things like passports or travel documents.",True

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Even after all the success the San Francisco 49ers had the past few seasons, a two-game skid and a string of injuries early in the season can raise some doubts for any team.
Considered those answered for one day at least.
Brock Purdy threw a touchdown pass, Fred Warner returned an interception for a score and the 49ers bounced back by beating the New England Patriots 30-13 on Sunday.
“We needed it,” left tackle Trent Williams said. “It was more than just going 2-2 on the season. It was something for the confidence.”
The confidence took a hit for the 49ers after losses on the road the past two weeks at Minnesota and against the Los Angeles Rams, plus injuries to several key players.
But the Niners found their footing quickly back at home against the struggling Patriots (1-3). The defense delivered six sacks and a touchdown in the first game since losing Javon Hargrave to a potentially season-ending injury, Purdy hit three deep passes and Jordan Mason rushed for 123 for his third 100-yard rushing game in four weeks.
“It feels good to get a win,” defensive end Nick Bosa said. “It’s such a long year. If you look from an outsider’s perspective or looked online you’d think the building’s burning down. But I told the d-line guys in our meeting last night that we’ve lost some guys, but I haven’t lost confidence in this group.”
San Francisco got field goals from Jake Moody on the opening two drives before Warner delivered his latest big play of the season, making a diving interception against Jacoby Brissett and returning it 45 yards for his second career TD. Warner has three forced fumbles and two interceptions through four games this season. 


It was the first interception of the season for the Patriots, who have been unable to get any consistent passing game generated with Brissett at quarterback, which will lead to more questions about when rookie Drake Maye will take over.

Brissett went 19 for 32 for 168 yards and was sacked six times for 25 yards. New England has been held under 150 yards passing in each of the first four games of the season for the first time since 1971.
“At this point, Jacoby is our starting quarterback,” coach Jerod Mayo said. “I haven’t watched any film or anything like that. He’s been a great leader. ... We’ve got to watch the film. We’ve got a long flight to go back and watch the film and we’re always evaluating every single position.”
Purdy hit several deep passes on the day for San Francisco on the way to throwing for 288 yards, with his TD coming to George Kittle.
The Niners were held to field goals on their first two drives after getting inside the 10 and looked like they might have to settle for one again late in the second quarter after penalties wiped out two potential touchdowns.
But then Purdy threw a high pass up for grabs that Kittle leaped to grab between three defenders for his second touchdown of the season to make it 20-0.
“I saw him break out. I was getting hit so I was like, ‘I have to give my guy a shot here and give him a chance,’” Purdy said. “I put it up for him. He made a great play, way better than the throw. He made the play.”
San Francisco allowed a 63-yard field goal by Joey Slye on the final play of the first half and then rookie Isaac Guerendo lost a fumble on the opening kick of the second half in the latest special teams blunder for the 49ers.
That set up Brissett’s 5-yard touchdown pass to Austin Hooper that made it 20-10.
Purdy answered with a 53-yard pass to open the next drive, setting up Mason’s 4-yard run that put San Francisco back in control with a 27-10 lead. 
Patriots: C David Andrews (shoulder), OT Caedan Wallace (ankle) and S Kyle Dugger (ankle) all left the game in the first half and didn’t return.
49ers: Warner left the game late in the first half with an ankle injury and didn’t return. .... DT Jordan Elliott (knee) also got hurt in the first half.
Patriots: Host Miami on Sunday.
49ers: Host Arizona on Sunday.

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Three Libertarian candidates seeking U.S. House seats in Iowa will not appear on the ballot this November following a judge’s ruling Saturday, upholding a state election panel’s decision.
The ruling came in an appeal by the candidates after the State Objection Panel, composed of one Democratic and two Republican elected officials, ruled 2-1 that the Libertarian candidates should be removed from the ballot on a technicality.
The panel agreed with several Republican Party officials who argued that the Libertarian Party failed to follow state law when it nominated the candidates at its county conventions, which were held on the same day as precinct caucuses where the county convention delegates were selected. State law says the term of convention delegates begins the day after the caucuses.
That means the Libertarian candidates were not nominated at valid county conventions, conservative attorney Alan Ostergren argued.
Polk County District Judge Michael Huppert agreed and rejected the candidates’ arguments that the state panel had no authority to strike them from the ballot. He found that the state law is “mandatory in nature and requires strict compliance.”
“The panel concluded correctly by requiring this level of compliance,” Huppert wrote.
The panel’s two Republican members, Attorney General Brenna Bird and Secretary of State Paul Pate, sided with the challengers, saying the parties are obligated to follow the rules governing candidate nominations. The lone dissent on the three-person panel came from State Auditor Rob Sand, a Democrat, who accused his colleagues of political bias.


Independent or third-party candidates usually have little chance of winning. Still, the question of how their margin of support could change the outcome of the race vexes Democratic and Republican leaders alike.
“In general, the parties are worried about minor parties that might take votes from them,” said Stephen Medvic, professor of government at Franklin & Marshall College. “It’s a pretty straightforward calculus. The Libertarian is more likely to take votes from the Republican.”
Challenges to third-party candidates are as common as the election cycle, Medvic said, and especially at the presidential level, they often occur in swing states where a fraction of the vote for a third-party candidate could matter most.
One of Iowa’s four congressional races was decided by a razor-thin margin in 2022. Republican Zach Nunn, who challenged incumbent Democrat Cindy Axne, won by less than a percentage point. There was not a third-party candidate.
The Libertarian Party of Iowa reached major party status in 2022, when their nominee for governor earned support from more than 2% of voters.
The state’s attorney told the judge at a hearing Thursday that the state’s regulations for major parties are reasonable and non-discriminatory to keep the nominating process organized and transparent, arguing that Iowa’s interest in keeping the candidates off the ballot is to maintain election integrity.
The chair of the Libertarian Party of Iowa, Jules Cutler, told the judge that this was “bullying” to keep the “small kid on the block” off the ballot. Cutler has called the party’s technical mistakes embarrassing but argued they should not invalidate the nominations.
What to know about the 2024 Election
The judge’s ruling means that the names of Libertarian nominees Nicholas Gluba in the 1st District, Marco Battaglia in the 3rd District and Charles Aldrich in the 4th District will not be included — for now — on the ballot.
Ballots were supposed to be certified by Pate’s office on Sep. 3, but the judge ordered certification to be put on hold until the issue could be heard in court. An appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court is still possible, further delaying the certification and printing of ballots.",False

LAS VEGAS (AP) — A’ja Wilson scored 21 points and blocked five shots after earning her record-tying third MVP award earlier Sunday, and the two-time defending-champion Las Vegas Aces held the Seattle Storm to a pair of free throws in the fourth quarter in pulling away for a 78-67 victory in Game 1 of the best-of-three series.
Wilson made just 1 of 8 shots as Las Vegas missed 16 of 18 altogether and fell behind 18-9 after one quarter. She had four points at halftime and Seattle led 42-38 after Jordan Horston and Mercedes Russell both made two free throws in the final 43 seconds. 
But the third quarter was a different story as Wilson sank seven shots with a 3-pointer, accounting for 15 of the Aces’ 26 points. Skylar Diggins-Smith had a three-point play in the final minute and the Storm took a 65-64 lead into the final period.
Kelsey Plum missed her first seven shots, but she had the first basket of the final quarter at the 7:04 mark to give Las Vegas the lead. Seattle missed its first seven shots, and back-to-back layups from Wilson and Tiffany Hayes pushed the Aces’ lead to 70-65 with 4:49 left to play. Diggins-Smith hit two free throws for the Storm’s first points to get them within three, but Chelsea Gray had two baskets in an 8-0 run to wrap up the victory. Seattle missed all 13 of its shots and turned the ball over six times in the final 10 minutes.
Hayes finished with 20 points and five steals off the bench for fourth-seeded Las Vegas. Gray had 16 points and seven assists. Jackie Young added 12 points and seven rebounds. Wilson had eight boards. She joined Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie and Lauren Jackson as the league’s only three-time MVPs.
Diggins-Smith led fifth-seeded Seattle with 16 points and eight assists. Gabby Williams finished with 14 points and eight rebounds, while Nneka Ogwumike had 13 points and 10 rebounds. Horston had 10 points off the bench.


Seattle beat Las Vegas by 13 the first time they met this season, but the Aces closed with three straight victories over the Storm — two by double digits.
Las Vegas will host Game 2 on Tuesday. Seattle would host Game 3 on Thursday, if necessary.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Edouard Julien hit a three-run homer, and the Minnesota Twins beat the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 Thursday in a game with a 13-minute interruption largely caused by a video review.
With Tampa Bay trailing 4-2 in the seventh inning and Jonny DeLuca on third, Yandy Díaz sliced a drive toward the right-field corner, Matt Wallner gloved the ball on two hops as DeLuca scored, and Wallner’s momentum carried him over the low wall and into a camera well.
Umpires held a crew chief review that took about nine minutes and determined Díaz should be placed on second base. 
“If the guy has possession of the ball going into the stands, it’s one base. If he doesn’t have possession of it, it can be two bases,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “So he had possession of it. ... I’m confident that they got the call right.”
Twins manager Rocco Baldelli then brought in reliever Griffin Jax to replace Pablo López (14-8). Jax retired Brandon Lowe on a groundout.
“It was the difference between a man being on second and third. When you’re on third you can score on a wild pitch, you can find a way to score,” said Díaz, who had two of the Rays’ eight hits.
López gave up three runs and seven hits, struck out nine and walked one. His scoreless streak reached 23 1/3 innings before Junior Caminero’s two-run single in the third.
“I didn’t know what was going on,” López said of the long video review. “The Jumbotron said the play is under review, and the umpire said it was about the rules of the ballpark and they were trying to get everything right. I wasn’t happy that it took that long and may have cost me (the completion of the inning).”


Jhoan Durán struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 22nd save in 24 chances as the Twins gained a four-game split.
Minnesota (76-64) moved a half-game ahead of idle Kansas City (76-65) for the AL’s second wild card.
Eight of the last nine games between the teams have been decided by one run.
Julien homered in the second inning on a first-pitch splitter from Taj Bradley (6-10) and Wallner in the third on a 2-0 fastball.
Bradley allowed six hits in seven innings, struck out 10 and walked one. He is 0-6 in seven starts since winning at Toronto on July 25.
He gave up one hit in 4 2/3 innings after the homers. His seven innings matched a career high.
“You kind of get angry after something like that,” he said. “I just concentrated on not letting those runs beat me. I feel like that’s what’s been happening; I’d come out early because of the big inning. I was just trying to eliminate that.”
Before the game, the Rays recalled infielder Austin Shenton from Durham, selected the contract of left-hander Mason Montgomery from the Triple-A affiliate, optioned left-hander Tyler Alexander to the Bulls and designated catcher Alex Jackson for assignment.
Montgomery made his major league debut with a hitless eighth inning that included a walk.
Twins: OF Max Kepler (left patellar tendinitis) was placed on the 10-day injured list and OF DaShawn Keirsey Jr.'s contract was selected from Triple-A St. Paul, Keirsey made his major league debut in the eighth inning in center field. ... OF Byron Buxton’s recovery has been hampered by continued discomfort in his right hip, according to manager Rocco Baldelli reported. Buxton played briefly before being ejected from his first rehab game Wednesday night. 
Twins: RHP Zerby Matthews (1-2, 7.41) will make his fifth career start of his career Friday night in the opener of a three-game series at Kansas City. 
Rays: RHP Shane Baz (2-2, 3.49) will try to win his third straight start Friday night at Baltimore.

WASHINGTON (AP) — One of the biggest challenges for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the final stretch of the campaign is introducing herself to voters before her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has a chance to define her.
Until her sudden election to the top of the Democratic ticket this summer, Harris was still a somewhat unknown figure in national politics, driven in part by her aversion to opening up and embracing the spotlight. And since she’s become the nominee, Republicans have criticized Harris for not doing many interviews or giving enough specifics on her policy plans.
But the vice president is sharing personal details about her childhood, cooking and food to show her more private side.
It is known that Harris is a foodie and likes to cook. In fact, she had just made a pancakes-and-bacon breakfast for her niece’s 6- and 8-year-old daughters on the July morning when Biden called with the news that he was dropping out of the race. 
From talking about nacho cheese Doritos as her snack of choice to washing collard greens in the bathtub, Harris is aiming to connect with voters on a more personal level. While learning that she likes to munch tortilla chips at snack time likely isn’t enough on its own to sway anyone to vote for her, the small — and sometimes amusing — details could help Harris show she can relate to people and their concerns. 
“She is trying to show that she is a full person beyond just her policy proposals,” Dana Brown, executive director of the Pennsylvania Center for Women and Politics at Chatham University, said in an email. 


Stopping at Dottie’s Market in Savannah during a campaign bus tour of southeastern Georgia last week, Harris became excited by what she saw on the counter. 
“What is that cake?” she said. Chocolate caramel, an employee answered.
“I want a slice of that. Caramel is like my favorite,” Harris said. “Oh, chocolate and caramel?” she added, after appearing to digest the description. The cake was covered in a white frosting with caramel on top and drizzling down the sides. 
“Fantastic,” Harris said. 
“I was in band when I was your age,” she said while visiting marching band practice at Liberty County High School in Hinesville, Georgia. She gave a pep talk about leadership.
“All that you all are doing, it requires a whole lot of rehearsal, a whole lot of practice, long hours. Right?” she said. “Sometimes you hit the note; sometimes you don’t. Right? But all that practice makes for beautiful music.”
Harris did not say which instrument she played. An aide later told a reporter that Harris played French horn, xylophone and kettle drums; the vice president had confided that she “couldn’t stick with one” instrument.
Harris shared her collard greens recipe — and unusual preparation method — with Mashama Bailey, chef at The Grey restaurant in downtown Savannah. A friend used to ask Harris to make the greens for a yearly Christmas Eve party.
“And I am not lying to you that I would make so many greens that I’d need to wash them in the bathtub,” the vice president told Bailey. “I’m telling you the truth.” 
Harris starts by rendering the fat from bacon before stirring in sliced garlic, chili peppers, a lot of water and some chicken stock. “And I let it go for a while, before I put the greens in,” she said. After a couple of hours, she finishes with vinegar and Tabasco sauce.
What to know about the 2024 Election
According to McDonald’s, 1 in 8 Americans have worked at its fast-food restaurants at some point in their lives. Harris is among them.
“I had a summer job at McDonald’s,” she said at an August campaign rally in Las Vegas, trying to show an understanding of middle-class struggles. 
During a policy speech in North Carolina to discuss her price gouging proposal, also last month, Harris said she was in college when “I worked at McDonald’s to earn spending money.”
Her duties were making french fries and working the cash register, she said on “The Drew Barrymore Show” earlier this year. 
Harris and her sister, Maya, were raised by a single mother, Shyamala, an immigrant from India. Harris has said she was 13 when her mother bought her first home after saving for a decade.
At snack time, Harris reaches for Doritos.
“This is my go-to, the original, nacho cheese,” Harris said while holding a red bag of Doritos when she and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and their spouses stopped at a Sheetz convenience store in Moon Township during their campaign bus tour of southwestern Pennsylvania in August. 
Her soda of choice?

CHICAGO (AP) — Once Caleb Williams and the Bears’ offense found their rhythm, they started stringing together the sort of possessions the team and its fans envision on a regular basis.
Williams led four scoring drives, D’Andre Swift had 165 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown, and Chicago held off the Los Angeles Rams 24-18 on Sunday.
The Bears (2-2) scored touchdowns on back-to-back possessions in the second half after struggling early. Jaquan Brisker intercepted Matthew Stafford with about a minute remaining following a punt on the previous play.
Williams threw for 157 yards and a touchdown after setting a Bears rookie record by passing for 363 yards on 52 attempts in a loss at Indianapolis last week. He said this performance was a step forward.
The No. 1 overall draft pick and former Heisman Trophy winner out of Southern California was 17 of 23 with a 9-yard TD pass to DJ Moore in the third quarter. He did not have a turnover, coming off a game in which he got picked off twice and lost a fumble.
“Obviously when you don’t have two turnovers, that’s the most important thing,” Williams said. “When you have a defense like us, you have a punter and a kicker like we have, you’re not turning the ball over, it goes a long way. You’re going to win a lot of games.”
Swift had his best game since signing with the Bears in March. A Pro Bowler with Philadelphia last season, he broke off a 36-yard touchdown run that made it 24-15 in the fourth quarter. He finished with 16 rushes for 93 yards and seven catches for 72 yards.


Roschon Johnson ran for a 1-yard touchdown in the second quarter following a strip-sack by Montez Sweat deep in Los Angeles territory, and Chicago finished with 131 yards rushing after managing 63 against the Colts.

“We’re addressing the issues that need to be addressed,” coach Matt Eberflus said. “Early on it was getting in and out of the huddle and cadence and making sure we’re doing good there. And then it was distributing the ball to different skill sets. We did that. Now it’s running the football. We did a better job with that today. We’re just addressing the issues. When you’re building chemistry the first time together with a new and young quarterback, I just think that’s a part of growing.”
Brisker’s clinching pick felt particularly good since a penalty negated his interception in the end zone in the first half, and he also was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct.
“I owed the team one, just get my mind right, stay locked in, stay focused and try to get the ball at some point today,” said Brisker, who also had a sack in the fourth quarter.
The Bears won for the first time since beating Tennessee in Week 1 and snapped a three-game skid against the Rams (1-3), who were coming off a fourth-quarter rally to beat San Francisco.
“The guys stayed in the fight,” Los Angeles coach Sean McVay said. “There was some good things, but there was some really uncharacteristic mistakes that we made as a team in regards to just some mental errors, where we left people free. And you can’t do that if you’re going to be a good offense and consistently execute.”
Stafford moved ahead of Eli Manning for 10th on the NFL’s all-time passing list with 57,025 yards. The two-time Pro Bowler completed 20 of 29 passes for 224 yards. But he threw a late interception on first down at the Los Angeles 8. The Rams also had trouble finishing drives, with just one touchdown in four trips inside the red zone.
Tutu Atwell had 82 yards receiving with Cooper Kupp (ankle) and Puka Nacua (knee) sidelined, and Kyren Williams ran for 94 yards and a TD.
“They sting when you lose,” Stafford said. “They’re frustrating. I don’t really want to sit here and talk to you guys. There’s a lot of things that are frustrating about losses and they eat at us. But come Monday, time to move on and find a way to get a win next week.”
The Bears led 17-9 after Caleb Williams found Moore in the back of the end zone late in the third quarter.
The Rams answered with a 70-yard drive, capped by Kyren Williams’ 3-yard score on the first play of the fourth. That made it 17-15, but the 2-point conversion pass failed.
Chicago then went 70 yards for another TD. Caleb Williams hit Cole Kmet over the middle for a neat 22-yard pass, and Swift leapt over a lunging linebacker Michael Hoecht at the line on the next play to spring his long touchdown run, his first score since signing with the Bears in the offseason.
Joshua Karty cut it to 24-18 with a 52-yard field goal. 
Bears: RG Teven Jenkins (ribs) exited early in the second quarter after he was hurt blocking on a run. 
Rams: Host Green Bay next Sunday.
Bears: Host Carolina next Sunday.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a former rival, Gideon Saar, as a member of his Cabinet on Sunday, expanding his coalition and strengthening his hold on office.
Under their agreement, Netanyahu said Saar would serve as a minister without portfolio and serve in the Security Cabinet, the body that oversees the management of the ongoing war against Israel’s enemies across the Middle East.
Saar, 57, had hoped to replace Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, another rival of Netanyahu’s. But a deal to become defense minister fell through several weeks ago after fighting intensified with Hezbollah along Israel’s northern border, leaving the popular Gallant in office for the time being.
Saar has had a strained relationship with the prime minister. He was once a rising star in Netanyahu’s Likud party, but angrily left it four years ago after accusing the prime minister of turning it into a “cult of personality” as he battled corruption charges.
Since then, however, Saar has struggled as leader of a small conservative party, enjoying little support with the broader public. While he and Netanyahu have little love for one another, they share a hard-line ideology toward Israel’s Arab adversaries. 
In recent months, Saar has said Israel must fight until Hamas is destroyed. He also has called for tougher action against Hezbollah’s sponsor, Iran. And like Netanyahu, he strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state.


In a joint statement, they said they had put their differences aside for the good of the nation.
Netanyahu’s decision appears to have been driven in part by domestic politics. He faces a number of key political battles in the coming weeks — including the contentious issue of drafting ultra-Orthodox men into the army, passing a budget and taking the stand in his long-running corruption trial. Saar is expected to help Netanyahu on many of these issues.
His appointment also will likely scale back the influence of ultranationalist members of his coalition. Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s minister of national security, are religious ideologues who have threated to bring down the government if Netanyahu makes too many concessions in any cease-fire deal. Ben-Gvir has also drawn international criticism for provocative visits to a contested Jerusalem holy site.
Sunday’s agreement gives Saar, who hopes to be prime minister one day, an opportunity to revive his political career, while expanding Netanyahu’s majority coalition to 68 seats in the 120-seat parliament.

LONDON, Ky. (AP) — A manhunt was underway early Sunday as police searched for a gunman in a rural area of southeastern Kentucky near Interstate 75, according to authorities who said seven people were hurt in the shooting and a vehicle accident that accompanied the violence.
The shooting Saturday was followed by an intense search for a suspect by multiple law enforcement agencies. The Laurel County Sheriff’s Office said in a post on Facebook that it was an “active shooter situation” and “numerous persons” were shot near the highway. 
Deputy Gilbert Acciardo, a spokesperson for the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office, said authorities were notified about 5:30 p.m. Saturday about gunshots along Interstate 75. When they arrived at the scene in London, a small city of about 8,000 located about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Lexington, they found numerous vehicles on the side of the highway at Exit 49.
“When our first two units got to the scene there, they said it was a madhouse: people on the sides of the road, emergency flashers going, bullet holes, windows shot out, nine vehicles shot. Can you imagine that? Just chaotic,” Acciardo said during a news conference Sunday.
Five people were shot and all were in stable condition early Sunday, although some of the victims had “very serious” injuries, including one person who was shot in the face, Acciardo said. 
Two other people were hurt in the vehicle accident, he said.


Police blocked traffic in both directions on the highway because they did not know where the bullets came from. “We’re still attempting to determine that,” Acciardo said. 
Authorities believe there was only one shooter and Acciardo said they do not believe the shooting was sparked by road rage.
Officers from multiple law enforcement agencies searched a remote, wooded area, but eventually suspended the search because of darkness. The search will resume at daybreak Sunday, he said.
“We do have the area contained right now. It’s a very fluid investigation. Our people are still on the scene. Our special response team is there. We are trying to find a shooter there,” Acciardo said.
The sheriff’s office said a “Person of Interest” has been identified in connection with the shooting, saying he should be considered armed and dangerous and people should not approach him. The man’s name was given as Joseph A. Couch, a 32-year-old white male, and anyone with information about his location was urged to call the county 911 center. 
Acciardo cautioned that authorities “have not determined that this is the individual that fired the weapon.”
State lawmakers from Laurel County urged residents in the area to stay home as police continued to search for the shooter. 
“Without a doubt, this is an act of senseless violence that does not reflect the values of this community, our Commonwealth, or its people,” they said in a statement.
The interstate was closed 9 miles (14 kilometers) north of London but reopened about three hours later, according to the sheriff’s office.
In an video update on Facebook late Saturday night, London Mayor Randall Weddle tried to calm fears as the search continued for the gunman. He urged residents to call 911 if they hear or see anything suspicious near their homes.
“We’re asking folks please do not go outside your home shooting because we might have first responders in that area. It’s important to know you are safe. We have multiple agencies in this community, in the city of London and in Laurel County,” Weddle said.
Weddle said searchers “know the general area where this individual is,” but he would not release specific details.
“I am receiving initial reports from the Kentucky State Police and our Office of Homeland Security — together we are actively monitoring the situation and offering support in any way possible,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a post on the social platform X. “Please pray for everyone involved.”",True

Publication date:2024-09-29 13:44:00

NEW YORK (AP) — Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans says the sense of urgency that younger generations bring to solving international challenges needs to be nurtured in the rest of the world.
“So many of the world’s most prolific movements were started by people when they were young,” Hugh Evans said, noting that Martin Luther King Jr. was only 34 when he delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. “Can you imagine that? (Nelson) Mandela was 26 when he co-founded the ANC Youth League. Malala (Yousafzai) was 11 when she gave her first protest speech. And my hero (William) Wilberforce was 21 when he entered into politics. So we have to get our skates on.”
The Associated Press spoke with Evans shortly before Saturday’s Global Citizen Festival in New York, am event headlined by superstars like Post Malone and Doja Cat, as well as breakout artists like Benson Boone and Rauw Alejandro. The festival generated more than $1 billion in new commitments to fight extreme poverty, as well as a new partnership with FIFA in which Global Citizen supporters get tickets to matches by taking action on humanitarian issues. 
The interview was edited for clarity and length.
A: We’re operating against the backdrop of a world with constant shocks -- the ongoing shock of recovering from the pandemic and now the shocks of global conflicts. That has resulted in the first time in our lifetime where poverty for the last three years has been on the increase. We’re talking about 719 million people now living on less than $2.15 a day worldwide. The other big shock that the world hasn’t yet fully experienced is the shock of climate change, which has the potential to push another 100 million people into extreme poverty in the next ten years.


A: Those are our big pushes this time. We want to address the reality that the world is confronting multiple crises at once.
A: Based on our most recent data, over 70% of our members are Gen Z. We need to continue to double down on that. It’s fueled by the reality that I think we have a model of activism powered through the Global Citizen app that young people can relate to. And it gives them the power of putting activism and advocacy within their own hands. I think that our approach has always been to try to equip young people with the best, most thoughtful policy asks that are backed by incredible research and data and have the ability to have the most profound impact to bring an end to extreme poverty.

Publication date:2024-09-09 07:00:00

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Tennessee Titans and quarterback Will Levis are going through some growing pains. 
First-year coach Brian Callahan’s challenge is speeding up Levis’ learning curve after a very painful lesson, blowing a 17-point lead to lose the season opener 24-17 in Chicago. 
Making it worse? Callahan just talked with Levis at the end of the third quarter that the Titans could win protecting a 17-10 lead by just punting with how well Tennessee’s defense was controlling the Bears. 
Then Levis, in his 10th NFL start, turned it over three times in the fourth quarter.
“Tough lesson to learn in a moment like that that loses you a game,” Callahan said Monday. 
The Titans know well enough they let a season-opening win on the road slip away. Center Lloyd Cushenberry said they also know they have a lot of room for improvement and need to put their foot down when up by double digits.
“We just have to learn not to beat ourselves,” Cushenberry said.
The defense under new coordinator Dennard Wilson. Tennessee held Chicago to 148 yards. The Titans held the Bears to an average of 2.79 yards per play. Chicago was the first NFL team in 32 games to win averaging fewer than 2.8 yards per play and first since Seattle beat Dallas 21-12 on Dec. 24, 2017. Teams had been 70-534-3 when being held to fewer than 2.8 yards per play. 
It was the best defensive performance since Sept. 19, 2010, when Tennessee held Pittsburgh to 127 yards and the franchise’s best defensive performance to open a season since 1995 when the then-Houston Oilers held Jacksonville to 146 yards in 1995.


The offense. Callahan was hired to rev up a group that averaged 17.9 points a game last season. The group looked efficient enough in scoring the first 17 points with free agent signee Tony Pollard averaging 5.1 yards on 16 carries.

Callahan, who is calling the offensive plays, said he can be better. The Titans also hurt themselves with eight penalties for 50 yards. Communication also needs to improve. Callahan noted one play where Levis threw to a spot where he expected receiver Calvin Ridley to be when the veteran was somewhere else.
RG Dillon Radunz. The second-round pick out of FCS North Dakota State in 2021 earned the starting job this preseason, helped when Saahdiq Charles abruptly retired. He took a hit that left him with injured ribs in the second half. Radunz tried to return after going to the locker room, then left the game.
Levis. Yes, the 33rd pick overall in the 2023 draft has had to learn his second offense with a second new coach and coordinator in as many offseasons. But Tennessee still had a 17-10 lead when the quarterback turned it over three times — twice in the span of less 4 1/2 minutes in the fourth quarter. 
Levis drifted left almost into a defender instead of moving up in the pocket, and Callahan said Levis reverted to some footwork issues the coach thought had been fixed. That’s when Levis threw the pick-6 instead of taking the sack. 
The Titans had a final chance to force overtime when Levis’ final pass on fourth down was picked off. Levis had only four interceptions in nine starts as a rookie. 
Radunz may be limited, but Callahan said the guard should be ready for Sunday’s home opener. 
2 — Number of rookies who started of the seven who played for Tennessee. Left tackle JC Latham gave up some pressures, including on the strip-sack of Levis. T’Vondre Sweat was the other rookie who started and he had a couple of quarterback pressures in 38 defensive snaps. 
The Titans host Aaron Rodgers and the New York Jets on Sunday with the Jets not only playing a second straight road game. The Jets also played Monday night in California with a long plane ride back home. Then Green Bay visits with Malik Willis, traded by Tennessee just before the final roster cut deadline, possibly starting with Jordan Love injured late in the Packers’ season opening loss.

LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — All good things come to an end. Few expected Liverpool’s good thing to end on Saturday.
An uncommon perfect run of three wins to start the English Premier League without conceding a goal came to a stunning end at Anfield where Nottingham Forest won for the first time since 1969.
Forest had 30% possession, three shots on target — all after halftime — and only two corners but Callum Hudson-Odoi curled a shot beyond the reach of Alisson in the 72nd minute and it held up in a 1-0 win.
Liverpool’s effort was scrappy as passes went astray and touches were often missed. The players looked like they hadn’t seen each other for two weeks.
The international break took away 10 players but manager Arne Slot said that was no excuse. 
“It’s always difficult, but I don’t think it had anything to do with it,” Slot said.
“Players came back strong and I saw today a team that wanted to fight until the end. That wasn’t to do with energy.
“If you look at the goals we scored until now, we scored quite a few from transition moments from winning the ball back, but the other team (Forest) played over our press a lot with a lot of long balls.
“Too many individual performances in ball possession were not up to the standards that I’m used to from these players.”
Liverpool’s best chance was its first when Luis Diaz shot against the near post and the ball ricocheted across the face of the goal.


The amount of possession Liverpool had made the result that much more pitiful for Slot.
“We had a lot of ball possession but only managed to create three or four quite good chances. That’s by far not enough.
“If you have so much possession and play so much in their half we need to be much better. We lost the ball so many times in simple situations.
“It is a big setback. If you lose a home game that’s always a setback.”

TORONTO (AP) — Dane Myers hit a three-run homer and finished with a career-high five RBIs, Griffin Conine had three hits and an RBI and the Miami Marlins claimed a series against Toronto for the first time since 2009 with an 8-1 victory over the Blue Jays on Saturday.
Miami’s Jesús Sánchez scored three runs for the second straight game.
Bench coach Luis Urueta managed the Marlins in the next-to-last game of the season after manager Skip Schumaker returned home to California because of a family medical issue. 
“I know he was watching,” said Urueta, who will also handle Sunday’s season finale.
Myers was activated off the 60-day injured list Tuesday. He fractured his left ankle when he kicked a door out of frustration after being ejected in a 10-6 loss at Cincinnati on July 13.
“I’m so happy for him, especially what he’s been through the last two months,” Urueta said. “To be able to come here today and do what he did, it’s pretty cool.”
Myers said it was tough being on the sidelines while injured.
“Sitting in the hotel watching the boys play was tough,” he said. “I think the mental rehab was a little bit harder than the physical rehab.”
Xzavion Curry (2-2) allowed one run and two hits in five innings in his first start with Miami, which won its third straight.
“Outstanding job,” Urueta said of Curry. “He attacked the zone, threw strikes.”
Darren McCaughan pitched the final four innings and earned his second save in two chances.


Miami had been winless in its past eight series against Toronto, losing six and splitting two. The Marlins swept a three-game road series against the Blue Jays in June 2009.
Nathan Lukes hit his first career home run for the Blue Jays — a solo shot in the first inning — but Toronto lost for the ninth time in 11 games. The Blue Jays are 7-16 in September.
Toronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. went 0 for 4 with a strikeout to remain one hit shy of 200. Manager John Schneider said Guerrero might lead off Sunday.
Blue Jays starter Yariel Rodríguez (1-8) wrapped up his rookie season by losing his fifth straight decision. 
“It’s not exactly the year that I really wanted,” Rodríguez said through a translator. “I know I can be better than that.”
The 27-year-old right-hander allowed three runs and four hits in five-plus innings. He walked two and struck out five.
Both of Rodríguez’s walks came in the first, and both scored on two-out, RBI hits by Jonah Bride and Conine.
Lukes cut the deficit in half by homering off Curry in the bottom of the inning, but Miami added three more in the sixth. Myers hit a bases-loaded double off the top of the right field wall that chased reliever Brendon Little before Jhonny Pereda added an RBI single off Erik Swanson.
Myers homered off Génesis Cabrera in the eighth, his third of the season.
Blue Jays: Toronto recalled RHP Nick Robertson from Triple-A Buffalo and optioned LHP Easton Lucas to the Spring Training Complex.
LHP Ryan Weathers (4-6, 3.81 ERA) is expected to start for Miami in Sunday’s season finale. The Blue Jays had not named a starter.
