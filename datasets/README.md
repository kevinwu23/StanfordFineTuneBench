# New Knowledge Datasets

Each CSV file in this directory contains evaluation data with the following core columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each example
- `prompt`: The input prompt/question
- `answer`: The expected answer/response

Individual datasets also contain additional columns specific to their evaluation criteria and domain.
