BERLIN (AP) — Rafael Nadal withdrew Thursday from next week’s Laver Cup in Berlin, leaving it unclear when the Spanish great will play again.
The Laver Cup — the tournament where Roger Federer retired in 2022 after teaming up with Nadal in doubles — would have been Nadal’s first event since the Paris Olympics and potentially one of his last ever.
“I’m really disappointed to share that I won’t be able to compete at the Laver Cup in Berlin next week,” the 38-year-old Nadal said. “This is a team competition and to really support Team Europe, I need to do what’s best for them and at this moment there are other players who can help the team deliver the win.”
The 22-time Grand Slam champion didn’t address his current fitness after a spate of injuries in recent years, or when he might play again.
Nadal withdrew last month from the U.S. Open, meaning he missed three of the four Grand Slam tournaments in 2024. He last played in reaching the men’s doubles quarterfinals at the Olympics, where he also lost in the second round of singles to Novak Djokovic.
The Laver Cup, to be held from Sept. 20-22, is an indoor hard-court men’s competition pitting Team Europe against Team World in a format reminiscent of golf’s Ryder Cup. No replacement for Nadal was immediately announced.

Follow AP’s live coverage of Helene and the 2024 hurricane season.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — An enormous Hurricane Helene swamped parts of Mexico on Wednesday as it churned on a path forecasters said would take it to Florida as a potentially catastrophic storm with a surge that could swallow entire homes, a chilling warning that sent residents scrambling for higher ground, closed schools, and led to states of emergency throughout the Southeast.
Helene’s center was about 430 miles (735 kilometers) southwest of Tampa, Florida, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, and the hurricane was expected to intensify and accelerate as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico toward the Big Bend area of Florida’s northwestern coast. Landfall was expected sometime Thursday evening, and the hurricane center said by then it could be a major Category 4 storm with winds above 129 mph (208 kph). 
Tropical storm conditions were expected in southern Florida Wednesday night, spreading northward and encompassing the rest of Florida as well as Georgia and South Carolina through Thursday night. The storm was moving north at 12 mph (19 kph) with top sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) Wednesday evening. 


Helene could create a life-threatening storm surge as high as 20 feet (6.1 meters) in parts of the Big Bend region, forecasters said. Its tropical storm-force winds extended as far as 345 miles (555 kilometers) from its center.
The fast-moving storm’s wind and rain also could penetrate far inland: The hurricane center posted hurricane warnings well into Georgia and tropical storm warnings as far north as North Carolina, and it warned that much of the Southeast could experience prolonged power outages, toppled trees and dangerous flooding.


“Just hope and pray that everybody’s safe,” said Connie Dillard, of Tallahassee, as she shopped at a grocery store with thinning shelves of water and bread before hitting the highway out of town. “That’s all you can do.”
One insurance firm, Gallagher Re, is expecting billions of dollars in damage in the U.S. Around 18,000 linemen from out of state staged in Florida, ready to help restore power. Airports in St. Petersburg, Tallahassee and Tampa were planning to close on Thursday, and 62 hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities evacuated their residents Wednesday.
Georgia activated 250 National Guard soldiers for rapid deployment. State game wardens, foresters and Department of Correction teams will help provide swift-water rescues and other emergency responses.
State meteorologist Will Lanxton said tropical storm-force winds are expected throughout Georgia. Lanxton said metro Atlanta hasn’t seen sustained tropical storm winds since Hurricane Irma in 2017.
“I think we’re going to see some significant power outages, probably nothing like we’ve seen, because it’s 159 counties wide,” said James Stallings, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency.
In Tallahassee, where stations started to run out of gas, 19-year-old Florida A&M student Kameron Benjamin filled sandbags with his roommate to protect their apartment before evacuating. Their school and Florida State shut down.
Florida and Georgia are preparing for what could be a Category 3 hurricane. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.
“This hurricane is heading straight to Tallahassee, so I really don’t know what to expect,” Benjamin said. 
As Big Bend residents battened down their homes, many saw the ghost of 2018’s Hurricane Michael. That storm rapidly intensified and crashed ashore as a Category 5 that laid waste to Panama City and parts of the rural Panhandle. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service posted an urgent warning for residents along Apalachee Bay:
“There is a danger of catastrophic and unsurvivable storm surge for Apalachee Bay,” it said. “Storm surge may begin to arrive as early as late Wednesday night ahead of the winds. This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay. Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!”
“People are taking heed and hightailing it out of there for higher ground,” said Kristin Korinko, a Tallahassee resident who serves as the commodore of the Shell Point Sailboard Club, on the Gulf Coast about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Tallahassee.
For toughened Floridians who are used to hurricanes, Robbie Berg, a national warning coordinator for the hurricane center, advised: “Please do not compare it to other storms you may have experienced over the past year or two.”
Helene is forecast to be one of the largest storms in breadth in years to hit the region, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. He said since 1988, only three Gulf hurricanes were bigger than Helene’s predicted size: 2017’s Irma, 2005’s Wilma and 1995’s Opal.
Areas 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Georgia-Florida line can expect hurricane conditions. More than half of Georgia’s public school districts and several universities canceled classes. 
And for Atlanta, which is under a tropical storm watch, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd.
“It’s going to be a lot like Hugo in Charlotte,” Shepherd said of the 1989 storm that struck the North Carolina city, knocking out power to 85% of customers as winds gusted above hurricane force. 
Landslides were possible in southern Appalachia, with catastrophic flooding predicted in the Carolinas and Georgia, where all three governors declared emergencies. Rainfall is possible as far away as Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana.
Parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula were under hurricane warnings as Helene wound between it and the western tip of Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm formed Tuesday in the Caribbean, and it flooded streets and toppled trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort city of Cancun. 
In Cuba, authorities moved cattle to higher ground and medical brigades went to communities often cut off by storms. The government preventively shut off power in some communities as waves as high as 16 feet (5 meters) slammed Cortes Bay. In the Cayman Islands, schools remained closed as residents pumped water from flooded homes.
In the U.S., federal authorities positioned generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams. 
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that Helene could be as strong as a Category 4 hurricane when it makes landfall. The state was providing buses to evacuate people in the Big Bend region and taking them to shelters in Tallahassee. 
But near Florida’s center, outside Orlando, Walt Disney World said its only closures Thursday would be the Typhoon Lagoon water park and its miniature golf courses.
Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.
The Atlantic’s ninth named storm of the season Tropical Storm Isaac formed Wednesday night in the Atlantic Ocean. It was expected to strengthen as it moves eastward, possibly becoming a hurricane by the end of the week, forecasters said, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
In the Pacific, former Hurricane John reformed Wednesday as a tropical storm and was strengthening as it threatened areas of Mexico’s western coast. Officials posted hurricane warnings for southwestern Mexico.
John hit the country’s southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing at least two people, triggering mudslides, and damaging homes and trees. It grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours and made landfall east of Acapulco. It reemerged over the ocean after weakening inland.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s governing party on Friday picked former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba as its leader, setting him up to become prime minister next week.
The party leadership is a ticket to the top job because the Liberal Democratic Party’s governing coalition controls parliament.
Considered a defense policy expert, Ishiba secured a come-from-behind win against Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who hoped to become the country’s first female prime minister.
AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on a new leader for Japan’s ruling party.
The LDP, which has enjoyed nearly unbroken rule since World War II, may have seen Ishiba’s more centrist views as crucial in pushing back challenges by the liberal-leaning opposition and winning voter support as the party reels from corruption scandals that drove down outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s popularity. 
After his victory was announced, Ishiba stood up, waved and bowed repeatedly and pledged to “devote all my body and soul” to regain public trust.

“We must be a party that allows members to discuss the truth freely, a party that is fair and impartial and a party that is humble,” he told a news conference later Friday. 
He stressed Japan needs to reinforce its security, noting recent violations of Japanese airspace by Russian and Chinese warplanes and repeated missile launches by North Korea.

He pledged to continue Kishida’s economic policy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and achieving real salary increases, while tackling challenges such as Japan’s declining birthrate and population, as well as resilience in one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.


“I will achieve a society in which women and young people can have hope, hard-working people feel rewarded, and anyone can excel,” Ishiba said. 
He is expected to call a general election within weeks to capitalize on his win, but it is unclear when. He only said that he would seek the public’s mandate at an appropriate time after forming his new administration.
Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance, and said Friday that the idea is to form “an organic connection” of existing U.S.-led defense networks such as the ANZUS alliance with Australia and New Zealand and its alliances with South Korea and the Philippines. “We have to think how we can achieve peace and stability in this region,” he said.
He also suggested a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, and said having Japanese Self Defense Forces training bases in the United States would “contribute to the strengthening of the Japan-U.S. security alliance,” though he did not elaborate. 
He is a supporter of Taiwan’ s democracy. He also advocates the establishment of a disaster management agency in one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.
Ishiba, first elected to parliament in 1986, has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and was LDP secretary general under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

But he has long been viewed with wariness by powerful conservatives in his party. The 67-year-old former banker was running in the party leadership race for a fifth time and had said this was going to be his “final battle.” 
A hawk on defense issues, Ishiba has riled some party leaders by supporting measures to improve gaps between men and women and legalizing same-sex marriage. 
A record nine lawmakers, including two women, ran in the vote decided by LDP members of parliament and about 1 million dues-paying party members. That’s only 1% of the country’s eligible voters. 
Some experts believe that party turmoil could mean that Japan will return to an era similar to the early 2000s, which saw “revolving door” leadership changes and political instability.
A succession of short-lived governments hurts Japanese prime ministers’ ability to set up long-term policy goals or develop trusted relations with other leaders. 
On Tuesday, Kishida and his Cabinet ministers will resign. Ishiba, after being formally elected in a parliamentary vote, will then form a new Cabinet later in the day, he said.

Kishida congratulated Ishiba on his victory and said his election is the first step for a new LDP.
“The LDP will be reborn and will live up to the people’s expectations and achieve results,” he said. As Japan faces security tensions in the region and elsewhere, Japan must step up its own defense power and its ties with the United States, he said. 
South Korea, which has substantially improved ties with Japan over the past year in the face of an increasingly assertive China, said in a Foreign Ministry statement that it was looking forward to “continuing active exchanges with the new prime minister.” 
The main opposition group, the liberal-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, has struggled to build momentum despite the LDP scandals. Experts say its newly elected leader, centrist former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, is pushing a conservative shift for the party to attract swing voters.
Voters expressed hope that Ishiba would bring a positive change to politics.

“I think the LDP made a wise decision,” said Takeshi Irita, a 64-year-old engineer. “He is among the most realistic and stable ones and his mindset is relatively closer to the public.”
Hideko Arakawa, an 84-year-old retiree, said she has high expectations because of Ishiba’s expertise as a veteran lawmaker. “I hope he strives to make changes in Japan,” she said.

LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) — Hinano Rodrigues remembers being 4 or 5 years old, carrying a bucket across a highway to the ocean in the Maui community where he still lives.

At dawn, he would accompany his grandmother to a reef at low tide, where she plucked black snails, spiny lobsters and spiky sea urchins from the craggy rock. In Hawaiian, she would instruct him to break off a branch of kiawe, a type of mesquite, to tease out an octopus hiding in a hole.

It taught Rodrigues, 71, the value of ahupuaa, a Native Hawaiian system for dividing land from the mountains down to the ocean, with the residents of each section living off the land and waters within it.

But now the section where he lives and where his ancestors have always lived — the Olowalu ahupuaa — is also home to a temporary landfill being used to store debris from the deadly wildfire that decimated the historic nearby town of Lahaina last summer, destroying thousands of buildings and killing 102 people. It’s enough refuse to cover five football fields five stories high, including soil contaminated with lead and arsenic.

A controversy over whether that site is truly temporary — and over where the debris might finally wind up — has sparked a fierce legal fight with tens of millions of dollars at stake, not to mention a priceless ecosystem rich with coral, manta rays and other sea life just offshore.

“Why would you go put opala like this in a place that’s clean?” Rodrigues asked, using a Hawaiian word for trash.



Handling debris after large wildfires is always a logistical challenge. After the 2018 Camp Fire killed 85 people and burned down most of the town of Paradise, California, more than 300,000 truck loads were required to transport the debris to three different landfills, said Cole Glenwright, the deputy incident commander of the debris removal operation. The whole process took about a year.

It’s taking much longer on Maui, given environmental concerns, how long it has taken to clear destroyed lots, worries about Native Hawaiian cultural sites, and tussling over the ownership of a potential permanent site for the debris.

The temporary landfill in Olowalu is a former quarry on state-owned land and close to Lahaina, which made it a convenient choice for quickly storing the debris being cleared away so the town can rebuild. Officials believe its arid climate will reduce the risk of contamination spreading, and they say they’ve taken many precautions, including using thick liner and stormwater controls to contain runoff.

Officials have analyzed samples of soil, groundwater and surface water and found no traces of contamination being released, according to a quarterly report released in July.

But the site is just uphill from a coral reef, and some locals fear an ecological catastrophe if pollution does reach the water. 

The operation of the site also threatens sacred Hawaiian shrines and altars and desecrates ancient Hawaiian burial sites, according to a lawsuit filed by two people who don’t want the debris in Olowalu. One of the plaintiffs is Manoa Ka’io Martin, whose ancestors are among those buried nearby. The other is farmer Eddy Garcia, who worries about contamination of the food he grows, including taro, bananas, pineapples and starfruit.

Amid demands to remove the debris from Olowalu, Maui County is seeking to seize a privately owned former quarry near the Central Maui Landfill across the island to use as a permanent dump site.

That’s prompted another legal fight. The company that owns the land, Komar Maui Properties, doesn’t want to give it up.

Komar bought the land in 2015 with plans to build a private landfill, but it says permitting issues have stalled development. It is contesting the county’s effort to take the property by eminent domain — a process by which governments can seize private land for public use, with fair compensation for the owner. A federal judge has prevented the county from taking immediate possession while the lawsuit plays out.

Andy Naden, general counsel and executive vice president of Komar Investments, the parent company of Komar Maui Properties, says the county moved to seize its land only after learning the Federal Emergency Management Agency would pay “tipping fees” associated with disposing of the Lahaina debris — fees typically paid by weight to landfill owners. Maui County charges a tipping fee of nearly $110 per ton for municipal solid waste.

“FEMA is going to dump 400,000 tons into this hole,” Naden said. “That equates to $44 million that the federal government is going to give to whoever has the hole.”

Shayne Agawa, director of Maui’s Department of Environmental Management, disputed that. He said his department has long been interested in acquiring the land as part of plans to expand the adjacent public landfill.

Agawa, who lives in Olowalu, said the county doesn’t want the debris to remain at the temporary site. But it has yet to come up with a backup plan in case the court blocks the county from seizing Komar’s land. Officials are looking at other nearby parcels, he said.

To respond to cultural concerns, Maui officials consulted with the county’s archaeologist, Janet Six, and FEMA had one of its historic advisors assess the site. Six told The Associated Press she could not rule out the presence of ancient cultural sites or burial grounds, but noted that the area was previously disturbed by mining. FEMA found that no historic properties would be affected.

The lawsuit filed by Garcia and Martin asserted that the construction and operation of the temporary dump has in fact damaged or desecrated such sites by exposing them to toxic material, in violation of Martin’s spiritual practices.

Garcia said he feels uneasy as rumbling trucks haul debris up the road next to his farm. He worries one heavy bout of rain will cause toxins from the debris to contaminate the food he grows.

The pair dropped their lawsuit after the county announced plans for the permanent site in central Maui, but their lawyer is considering their next legal steps while the debris sits in Olowalu.

“I have a feeling they’re going to try to make it permanent and just say, ‘Sorry, we can’t move it to the other site,’” Garcia said.

Further complicating the issue is that the ashes or bones of some fire victims might be mingled in the debris. Raenelle Stewart’s 97-year-old grandmother died in the fire. Stewart often wonders if the ashes the family received contained all her remains. The fire debris should be kept nearby, she said.

“I think they should designate a spot in Lahaina for it,” she said. “I don’t think it’s so toxic that the earth can’t handle.”

Randy Awo, a retired administrator in the state Department of Land and Natural Resources, is a Native Hawaiian resident of Maui. He’d prefer to have the debris shipped out of state — an option officials rejected as too expensive.

Awo called the concerns about remains “a sacred topic” and said he does not want to be insensitive to families who lost loved ones. But, he added, the community must also protect Maui’s finite amount of land.

“When our environment is subjected to toxins that threaten life itself,” Awo said, “we have to start making decisions that weigh both.”",True,"400,000 tons","400,000 tons","400,000 tons","20,000 tons

TOKYO (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping is reported to be a big soccer fan, and he promised in a 2015 document to resuscitate the men’s national team, damaged by abysmal results on the global stage and widespread corruption in local leagues. 
He cannot be happy.
Japan defeated China 7-0 on Thursday in a World Cup qualifier in Saitama, Japan, a brutal loss that came against one of China’s biggest sports and geopolitcal rivals in Asia. It was China’s most lopsided loss against Japan, and a historic loss in World Cup qualifying.
China’s national team coach Branko Ivankovic of Croatia called it a “most difficult night,” as quoted in English by the official Xinhua news agency, which termed the loss “humiliating.”
Wataru Endo and Kaoru Mitoma scored in the first half on a night of Asian World Cup qualifiers. Takumi Minamino scored twice in the second half with others from Daizen Maeda, Junya Ito and Takefusa Kubo.
“It was a tough match,” Xinhua quoted Ivankovic as saying. “And as a coach, this was the most difficult night for me.”
Reaction in China was muted on state media. The China Sports Daily had a very short story titled: “China lost to Japan in World Cup qualifier” with few details.
But there was more discussion on Chinese social media.
Zhang Feng, a journalist and commentator with a popular blog, was direct.
“Football cannot be boosted by singing odes, or telling stories,” he wrote. “It needs skill, and physical and tactical training. It cannot be accomplished through politics.”


Tang Yinghong. a prolific writer with a large following, suggested football is not a good fit for China, which won 40 gold medals in the recent Paris Olympics to tie the United States. Some were in sports like diving and others that do not have a large global following.
“In my opinion, let’s just let football develop on its own,” Tang wrote. “Leaders should not place high hopes on the sport, and the government needn’t give it a lot of care.”
China has nine more qualifying matches remaining, and still has a shot at reaching the expanded, 48-team World Cup in 2026, hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. But even with the larger and weakened field, China still might not make it.
China has qualified only once for the World Cup. It lost all three matches in 2002 and failed to score a goal.
China is No. 87 in the most recent FIFA rankings for men’s teams, just below the Caribbean island of Curaçao (population 150,000), and just above the African nation of Equatorial Guinea (1.7 million). China’s population is about 1.4 billion.

CAIRO (AP) — New fighting rocked Sudan’s capital on Thursday with airstrikes and drone attacks in and around Khartoum amid a worsening cholera outbreak, officials said.
Sudan’s military launched an operation in the early hours of Thursday aimed at taking control of areas in the capital that had been in the hands of its enemy, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. Sudanese media reported increased military movements and airstrikes in the districts of Khartoum and Omdurman, the heaviest in the capital area in months. 
Mohamed Ibrahim, the health ministry’s spokesperson in Khartoum, said in a statement that four civilians were killed and 14 others wounded in the latest fighting in the Karrari district of Omdurman, a city next to the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
A military spokesman confirmed the operation was underway, but declined to comment further. A military spokesman confirmed the operation was underway, but declined to comment further. The head of Sudan’s military, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, addressed the U.N. General Assembly in New York, saying that “we’ve done everything we could to put an end to this war and to steer our country from the destruction being waged” by the militia.
He maintained that position when he spoke to reporters at the Sudanese Mission to the United Nations on Thursday evening.
“The operation going on in Khartoum is meant to preserve the integrity of our country, the safety of our people and our armed forces,” he said.


“The military solution is the last one,” Burhan continued. “We crave a peaceful solution that spares out people more suffering, more hunger, more displacement.” 
Burhan, who led a military takeover of Sudan in 2021, is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.
His country plunged into chaos in April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military led by Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo broke out into street battles in Khartoum. Fighting has spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas and the western Darfur region.
At a General Assembly whose doomsday feeling was fueled by three major wars along with inaction on global warming, the fighting and humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan took third place after the killing in the Middle East and Ukraine. The lack of focus on Sudan was bemoaned by many. 
The “brutal power struggle” between Sudan’s warring generals has “unleashed horrific violence,” including widespread rape, and a “humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding as famine spreads,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told the annual high-level gathering of the 193 member nations on Tuesday.
Saudi Arabia, the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations met without measurable results Wednesday to urge Sudan’s warring parties in Sudan to hold breaks in the fighting and allow aid to reach civilians.
“More than 25 million Sudanese face acute hunger,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement Wednesday. “Some 11 million have fled their homes in what has become the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet ... We must compel the warring parties to accept humanitarian pauses.” 
Jeremy Laurence, a spokesman for the U.N. human rights office in Geneva, said in a statement to The Associated Press on Thursday that at least 78 civilians were killed because of artillery shelling and airstrikes since the beginning of September in the Khartoum area.
“Our immediate concern is for the welfare of civilians, and the likelihood of further displacement and damage to civilian infrastructure,” he said.
For months, some of the worst fighting has been in the city of El Fasher, the capital of the North Darfur state. RSF forces have laid siege to the city since May. On Thursday, U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said that artillery shelling on a market there had killed at least 20 civilians on Sep. 20 and 21. 
Meanwhile, the death toll from Sudan’s cholera outbreak jumped by nearly 100 or nearly 20% in only two days, Sudan’s health ministry said Wednesday, in a worrying sign that the disease is spreading more rapidly. A total of 473 people have died from cholera since the country’s rainy season began two months ago, health officials said.
Sudan’s Federal Ministry of Health in a Wednesday update reported on Facebook 14,944 cholera cases across 10 states, with 386 new cases. It said that six people died on Tuesday alone in six states. 
The majority of cases were reported in Kassala, where UNICEF is collaborating with the ministry and the World Health Organization to carry out a second round of the oral cholera vaccination campaign that kicked off last week.
UNICEF delivered 404,000 doses of the vaccine to Sudan on Sep. 9. More vaccination campaigns are expected to be rolled out in other affected states. 
Cholera was officially declared an outbreak on August 12 by the health ministry after a new wave of cases was reported starting July 22. The disease is spreading in areas devastated by recent heavy rainfalls and floods, especially in eastern Sudan which sheltered millions of people displaced by the conflict between the Sudanese military and the RSF. 
Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and could be fatal if not immediately treated, according to WHO. It’s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.
UNICEF said in a statement last week that an estimated 3.4 million children under the age of 5 are at high risk of epidemic diseases. 
The war in Sudan created environments prone to disease outbreaks, impacting millions of people already experiencing food insecurity and displacement. The country plunged into war in April 2023 after tensions increased between the military and the RSF.

WINDER, Ga. (AP) — A 14-year-old student opened fire at a Georgia high school and killed four people on Wednesday, authorities said, sending students scrambling for shelter in their classrooms — and eventually to the football stadium — as officers swarmed the campus and parents raced to find out if their children were safe. 

The dead were identified as two students and two teachers at Apalachee High School in Winder, about an hour’s drive from Atlanta. Killed were two other 14-year-olds, Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, and instructors Richard Aspinwall and Christina Irimie, Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said in a nighttime news conference. 

At least nine other people — eight students and one teacher — were taken to hospitals with injuries. All were expected to survive, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith said.



The words “hard lockdown” appeared on a screen in junior Layla Ferrell’s health class and lights began flashing. She and her frightened classmates piled desks and chairs in front of the door to create a barricade, she recalled.

Sophomore Kaylee Abner was in geometry class when she heard the gunshots. She and her classmates ducked behind their teacher’s desk, and then the teacher began flipping the desk in an attempt to barricade the classroom door, Abner said. A classmate beside her was praying, and she held his hand while they all waited for police.

After students poured into the football stadium, Abner saw teachers who had taken off their shirts to help treat gunshot wounds.



Two school resource officers encountered the shooter within minutes after a report of shots fired went out, Hosey said. The suspect, a student at the school, immediately surrendered and was taken into custody. He is being charged as an adult with murder. Authorities said the weapon was an assault-style rifle.

The teen had been interviewed after the FBI received anonymous tips in May 2023 about online threats to commit an unspecified school shooting, the agency said in a statement.

The FBI narrowed the threats down and referred to the case to the sheriff’s department in Jackson County, which is adjacent to Barrow County.

The sheriff’s office interviewed the then-13-year-old and his father, who said there were hunting guns in the house but the teen did not have unsupervised access to them. The teen also denied making any online threats.

The sheriff’s office alerted local schools for continued monitoring of the teen, but there was no probable cause for arrest to additional action, the FBI said.

Hosey said the state Division of Family and Children’s Services also had previous contact with the teen and will investigate whether that has any connection with the shooting.

Authorities were still looking into how the suspect obtained the gun used in the shooting and got it into the school in Barrow County, a rapidly suburbanizing area on the edge of metro Atlanta’s ever-expanding sprawl. 

At an afternoon news conference, Smith choked up as he began to speak. He said he was born and raised in the community and his kids are in the school system.

“My heart hurts for these kids. My heart hurts for our community,” he said. “But I want to make it very clear that hate will not prevail in this county. I want that to be very clear and known. Love will prevail over what happened today.”

It was the the latest among dozens of school shootings across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut, Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas. The classroom killings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to active shooter drills in classrooms. But they have done little to move the needle on national gun laws.

Before Wednesday, there had been 29 mass killings in the U.S. so far this year, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. At least 127 people have died in those killings, which are defined as incidents in which four or more people die within a 24-hour period, not including the killer — the same definition used by the FBI.

Last year ended with 217 deaths from 42 mass killings, making 2023 one of the deadliest years on record for such shootings in the country.

On Wednesday in Winder, Landon Culver, an 11th grader, said he had stepped out of his algebra class to get a drink of water when he heard shots and then saw someone wearing a black hoodie with a long gun.

“I didn’t really stick around too long to look,” he said.

Instead he ran back inside the classroom and locked the door. The class huddled in the back in the dark and waited for the rampage to end. Culver listened as gunshots rang out in the building.

“You’re just wondering like, which one of those is going to be somebody that you’re best friends with or somebody that you love?” he said.

Later police officers arrived and escorted the students out. As they were leaving the building, Culver saw “multiple people who had been shot.”

“You hear about this kind of stuff, but you like never think it’s going to happen to you until like it’s happening.”

When Erin Clark, 42, received a text from her son Ethan, a senior, saying there was an active shooter, she rushed from her job at the Amazon warehouse to the school. The two texted “I love you,” and Clark prayed for her him as she drove.

With the main road to the school blocked, she parked and ran with other parents. They were directed to the football field, and amid the chaos, Clark found Ethan sitting on the bleachers. 

Clark said her son was writing an essay in class when he first heard gunfire. He worked with his classmates to barricade the door and hide.

“I’m so proud of him for doing that,” she said. “He was so brave.”

“It makes me scared to send him back,” Clark said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.”

Traffic going to the school was backed up for more than a mile as parents tried to get to their children. Barrow County schools will be closed for the rest of the week as they cooperate with the investigation, but grief counseling will be available.

“It’s just outrageous that every day, in our country, in the United States of America, that parents have to send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive,” Vice President Kamala Harris said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire.

In a message posted to social media, former President Donald Trump said: “These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster.” 

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who canceled a speech planned for the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas and returned to the state, said in a statement: “This is a day every parent dreads, and Georgians everywhere will hug their children tighter this evening because of this painful event.” 

Apalachee High School opened in 2000 and has about 1,900 students, according to records from Georgia education officials. 

On Wednesday evening, hundreds gathered in Jug Tavern Park in downtown Winder for a vigil. Volunteers handed out candles and also water, pizza and tissues. Some knelt as a Methodist minister led the crowd in prayer after a Barrow County commissioner read a Jewish prayer of mourning.

Some were clad in athletic gear from Apalachee’s crosstown rival, Winder-Barrow High School. At the end of the vigil, someone released balloons in Apalachee’s blue, gold and white. 

Sophomore Shantal Sanvee, who was in a classroom near the gunshots, said she saw “a whole lot of blood. And it was just, it was just horrible.”

“I don’t think I want to be here for like a long time now,” Sanvee said.

HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — The death toll in the aftermath of Typhoon Yagi in Vietnam climbed to 233 on Friday as rescue workers recovered more bodies from areas hit by landslides and flash floods, state media reported. 
Flood waters from the swollen Red River in the capital of Hanoi were beginning to recede, but many neighborhoods remained inundated and farther north, experts were predicting it could still be days before any relief is in sight. 
Typhoon Yagi made landfall Saturday, setting off heavy rains that have triggered flash floods and landslides, particularly in Vietnam’s mountainous north. Across the country, 103 people are still missing and more than 800 have been injured. 
In a village on the outskirts of Hanoi, Nguyen Thi Loan returned to the home that she’d hastily fled on Monday as the floodwaters rose. Much of A Lac village was still under water, and as she surveyed the damage, she wondered how she and others would manage. 
“The flood has made our lives so difficult,” she said. “Our rice crop has been destroyed and at home the electrical appliances like the washing machine, TV and fridge are under water.”
Most fatalities have come in the province of Lao Cai, where a flash flood swept away the entire hamlet of Lang Nu on Tuesday. Eight villagers turned up safe on Friday morning, telling others that they had left before the deluge, state-run VNExpress newspaper said. However, 48 others from Lang Nu have been found dead, and another 39 remain missing.


Roads to Lang Nu have been badly damaged, making it impossible to bring in heavy equipment to aid in the rescue effort.
Some 500 personnel with sniffer dogs are on hand, and in a visit to the scene on Thursday, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh promised they would not relent in their search for those still missing.
“Their families are in agony,” Chinh said.
Coffins were stacked near the disaster site in preparation for the worst, and villager Tran Thi Ngan mourned at a makeshift altar for family members she had lost. 
“It’s a disaster,” she told VTV news. “That’s the fate we have to accept.”
In Cao Bang, another northern province bordering China, 21 bodies had been recovered by Friday, four days after a landslide pushed a bus, a car and several motorcycles into a small river, swollen with floodwaters. Ten more people remain missing. 
Experts say storms like Typhoon Yagi are getting stronger due to climate change, as warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel them, leading to higher winds and heavier rainfall.
The effects of the typhoon, the strongest to hit Vietnam in decades, were also being felt across the region, with flooding and landslides in northern Thailand, Laos and northeastern Myanmar.
In Thailand, 10 deaths have been reported due to flooding or landslides, and Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra flew to the north on Friday to visit the border town of Mae Sai. Thailand’s Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation warned of a continuing risk of flash floods in multiple areas through next Wednesday, as new rain was expected to increase the Mekong River’s levels further. 
In Myanmar, the army said Friday that at least 33 people died across the country since Wednesday. It said 187 relief camps have been established for nearly 240,000 flood victims from 34 townships.
There are fears the death toll may rise sharply as local news outlets reported dozens missing in floods and landslides in the central regions of Mandalay and Bago, as well as eastern Shan State and the country’s capital, Naypyitaw.
International aid has been flowing into Vietnam in the aftermath of Yagi, with Australia already delivering humanitarian supplies as part of $2 million in assistance.
South Korea has also pledged $2 million in aid, and the U.S. Embassy said Friday it would provide $1 million in support through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. 
“With more heavy rain forecast in the coming days, USAID’s disaster experts continue to monitor humanitarian needs in close coordination with local emergency authorities and partners on the ground,” the embassy said in a statement. “USAID humanitarian experts on the ground are participating in ongoing assessments to ensure U.S. assistance rapidly reaches populations in need.”
The typhoon and ensuing heavy rains have damaged factories in northern provinces like Haiphong, home to electric car company VinFast, Apple parts suppliers and other electronic manufacturers, which could affect international supply chains, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a research note. 
The center said 95% of businesses in Haiphong were to resume some activity on Sept. 10 but that “repair efforts will likely lower output for the next weeks and months.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Napheesa Collier scored a playoff career-high 38 points and the Minnesota Lynx blew a 23-point lead before rallying late to beat the Phoenix Mercury 102-95 on Sunday in Game 1 of a best-of-three series.
Minnesota, the Western Conference champions and No. 2 seed, turned a 32-19 first-quarter lead into a 50-27 advantage with 5:35 left before halftime. Phoenix whittled nine points off its deficit, trailing 56-42 at intermission, and closed within 77-69 heading to the fourth quarter.
Kahleah Copper scored five points in a 10-2 run and her 3-pointer followed by two free throws by Brittney Griner gave seventh-seeded Phoenix its first lead since scoring the first four points of the game. Natasha Cloud’s layup put the Mercury on top 92-91 with 2:06 left to play, but Myisha Hines-Allen answered with a layup and Bridget Carleton hit a 3-pointer in a 9-0 spurt to pull out the victory.
Collier sank 11 of 19 shots from the floor with three 3-pointers and 13 of 14 free throws for Minnesota. She added six rebounds and four assists. Kayla McBride hit three 3-pointers and all seven of her foul shots, scoring 20. Carleton had 12 points, six boards and four assists, and Hines-Allen added 10 points, five rebounds and three assists off the bench.
Cloud had 33 points, matching her postseason high, and 10 assists to lead Phoenix. Diana Taurasi made half of her 10 3-point attempts and scored 21. Copper added 16 points, and Griner finished with 10 points and six rebounds.


Collier finished four points shy of Breanna Stewart’s playoff-record 42-point effort. Stewart scored 42 points while playing for the Seattle Storm in a 97-92 loss to the Las Vegas Aces in Game 4 of a Western Conference semifinal in 2022.
Minnesota won three of four games — all by double digits — against Phoenix during the regular season. The Mercury beat the visiting Lynx 81-80 for their lone victory.
The Lynx will host Game 2 at the Target Center on Wednesday. Phoenix would host Game 3 on Friday, if necessary.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential candidate, is less popular among voters than his Democratic rival, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 
Both Vance and Walz entered the spotlight this summer as relative political unknowns. As both running mates prepare to address a huge audience in next week’s vice-presidential debate, Democrats are more positive about Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris than Republicans are about Vance and former President Donald Trump.
The findings of the new survey reinforce the challenge for the Republican presidential ticket as voting begins in more and more states. 
The poll shows that negative feelings about Vance are considerably more widespread than positive opinions. About half of registered voters have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Vance, up from about 4 in 10 in late July, while around one-quarter have a somewhat or very favorable view of him, and a similar share don’t know enough to say. 
Walz, by contrast, is better liked. About 3 in 10 voters have a negative view of Walz, while about 4 in 10 have a positive opinion and about 3 in 10 don’t know enough to say.
That difference in favorability extends to the candidates’ bases. About 7 in 10 Democratic voters have a positive opinion of Walz, compared to about 6 in 10 Republican voters who have a favorable view of Vance.


Democratic candidates tend to receive more support from women, while Republicans perform better among men. That gap is clear in Trump and Harris’ favorability numbers — but Walz is better liked than Vance among both men and women.
About 4 in 10 male and female voters have a positive view of Walz, while about 3 in 10 men and about one-quarter of women have a positive view of Vance.
Walz also has a popularity advantage over Vance among voters over the age of 60. Half of voters in this group view Walz somewhat or very favorably, while about 3 in 10 have a similar opinion of Vance.
Despite his strength over Vance in some areas, there are also some key Democratic groups where Walz still has work to do. About three-quarters of Black adults have a favorable view of Harris, while roughly half say the same about Walz. She is also viewed more positively by women; about 3 in 10 women don’t know enough about Walz to have an opinion.
In general, though, neither of the vice-presidential candidates outshine Harris or Trump among major demographic groups, and they remain less well-known than the presidential nominees, even among groups that are traditionally part of each party’s base. For example, about one-quarter of white voters without a college degree don’t know enough to say about Vance, and around 4 in 10 voters between the ages of 18 and 29 don’t have an opinion on Walz. 
This means their popularity could continue to shift as their national profiles rise. 
The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted Sept. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

NEW YORK (AP) — With presidential candidates looking on, some 9/11 victims’ relatives appealed to them Wednesday for accountability as the U.S. marked an anniversary laced with election-season politics.
In a remarkable tableau, President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris stood together at ground zero just hours after Trump and Harris faced off in their first-ever debate. Trump and Biden — the successor whose inauguration Trump skipped — shook hands, and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared to facilitate a handshake between Harris and Trump.
AP AUDIO: AP correspondent Julie Walker reports the U.S. remembers the lives taken by the 9/11 attacks, marking the anniversary with both family and politics.
Then the campaign rivals stood only a few feet (meters) apart, Biden and Bloomberg between them, as the hourslong reading of victims’ names began. At Trump’s side was his running mate, Sen. JD Vance.

The image was one of putting politics aside at this year’s solemn commemoration of the hijacked-plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001. But some victims’ relatives, after reading out names, delivered political messages of their own.

“We are pleading for your help, but you ignore us,” Allison Walsh-DiMarzio said, directly challenging Trump and Harris to press Saudi Arabia about any official involvement in the attacks. Most of the 19 hijackers were Saudi, but the kingdom denies it was behind their plot.
“Which one of you will have the courage to be our hero? We deserve better,” Walsh-DiMarzio said. She’s a daughter of 9/11 victim Barbara P. Walsh, an administrative assistant.


Joanne Barbara was one of multiple readers who spoke out against a now-revoked plea deal that military prosecutors struck with alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two fellow defendants.
“It has been 23 years, and the families deserve justice and accountability,” said the widow of Assistant Fire Chief Gerard A. Barbara.
Biden, on his last Sept. 11 in office, and Harris paid respects Wednesday at all three 9/11 attack sites: ground zero, the Pentagon and a rural part of Pennsylvania.
The president, vice president — and, separately, Trump — laid wreaths Wednesday afternoon at the Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Biden and Harris spoke with victims’ relatives and visited the local fire department; Trump and Vance went to a New York City firehouse earlier in the day.
The Flight 93 memorial stands where one of the hijacked planes crashed after crew members and passengers tried to storm the cockpit. Trump described the site as an “incredible place” in brief remarks from afar to reporters.
The attacks killed 2,977 people and left thousands of bereaved relatives and scarred survivors. The planes took down the World Trade Center’s twin towers and carved a gash in the Pentagon, the U.S. military headquarters, where Biden and Harris laid a red, white and blue wreath Wednesday afternoon. 
While many Americans may not observe 9/11 anniversaries anymore, “the men and women of the Department of Defense remember,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said earlier in the day.
The attacks altered U.S. foreign policy, domestic security practices and the mindset of many Americans who had not previously felt vulnerable to foreign extremists.
Effects rippled around the world. Victims came from more than 90 different countries, and the U.S. responded to the attacks with a “ Global War on Terrorism.” U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq killed hundreds of thousands of Afghans and Iraqis and thousands of American troops.
Communities around the country hold events on the anniversary, which Congress has titled both Patriot Day and a National Day of Service and Remembrance. 
Thousands of Americans commemorate it with volunteer work — among them Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. He packed meals in St. Paul for people in need.
During early anniversaries at ground zero, presidents and other officeholders read poems, parts of the Declaration of Independence and other texts.
But the National Sept. 11 Memorial and Museum decided in 2012 to limit the ceremony to relatives reading victims’ names.
If politicians “care about what’s actually going on, great. Be here,” said Korryn Bishop, who attended Wednesday to remember her cousin John F. McDowell Jr., who worked in finance. “If they’re just here for political clout, that upsets me.” 
Brandon Jones was glad politicians weren’t on the podium.
“This should be a site for coming together to find feasible solutions and peace. This should not be a place to score political points to get brownie points to round up your base,” said Jones. He’s a cousin of victim Jon Richard Grabowski, an insurance firm technology executive.
In 2008, then-senators and presidential campaign rivals John McCain and Barack Obama jointly paid their respects at ground zero. 
Eight years later, the Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, abruptly left the trade center ceremony, stumbled while awaiting her motorcade and later disclosed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia. The episode stirred fresh attention to her health, which her Republican opponent — Trump, who was also at that observance — had been questioning for months.
Over the years, some victims’ relatives have used the forum to exhort leaders to prioritize national security, acknowledge the casualties of the war on terror, complain that officials are politicizing 9/11 and even criticize individual officeholders. Others bemoan Americans’ divisions or decry violence.
“It’s my prayer that this wicked act called terrorism will never occur again,” Jacob Afuakwah said Wednesday. He lost his brother, Emmanuel Akwasi Afuakwah, a restaurant worker.
But many family members stick to tributes and personal reflections. Increasingly they come from children and young adults born after the attacks killed one of their relatives.
Thirteen-year-old twins Brady and Emily Henry read names to honor their uncle, firefighter Joseph Patrick Henry.
“We promise to continue telling your stories,” Emily Henry said, “and we’ll never let anyone forget all those lost on Sept. 11.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump launched his family’s cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, with an interview on the X social media platform in which he also gave his first public comments on the apparent assassination attempt against him a day earlier.
Trump did not discuss specifics about World Liberty Financial on Monday or how it would work, pivoting from questions about cryptocurrency to talking about artificial intelligence or other topics. Instead, he recounted his experience Sunday, saying he and a friend playing golf “heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five.”
“I would have loved to have sank that last putt,” Trump said. He credited the Secret Service agent who spotted the barrel of a rifle and began firing toward it as well as law enforcement and a civilian who he said helped track down the suspect.
World Liberty Financial is expected to be a borrowing and lending service used to trade cryptocurrencies, which are forms of digital money that can be traded over the internet without relying on the global banking system. Exchanges often charge fees for withdrawals of Bitcoin and other currencies.
Other speakers after Trump, including his eldest son, Don Jr., talked about embracing cryptocurrency as an alternative to what they allege is a banking system tilted against conservatives. 


Experts have said a presidential candidate launching a business venture in the midst of a campaign could create ethical conflicts.
“Taking a pro-crypto stance is not necessarily troubling; the troubling aspect is doing it while starting a way to personally benefit from it,” Jordan Libowitz, a spokesperson for the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said earlier this month.
During his time in the White House, Trump said he was “not a fan” of cryptocurrency and tweeted in 2019, “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” However, during this election cycle, he has reversed himself and taken on a favorable view of cryptocurrencies. 
He announced in May that his campaign would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency as part of an effort to build what it calls a “crypto army” leading up to Election Day. He attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville this year, promising to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” and create a bitcoin “strategic reserve” using the currency that the government currently holds.
Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who has done research on cryptocurrencies, said she was skeptical of Trump’s change of heart on crypto.
“I think it’s fair to say that that reversal has been motivated in part by financial interests,” she said.
Crypto enthusiasts welcomed the shift, viewing the launch as a positive sign for investors if Trump retakes the White House. 
Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has not offered policy proposals on how it would regulate digital assets like cryptocurrencies.
In an effort to appeal to crypto investors, a group of Democrats, including Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, participated in an online “Crypto 4 Harris” event in August.
Neither Harris nor members of her campaign staff attended the event.

Publication date:2024-09-26 00:13:00

A 10th person has died in the listeria outbreak that shuttered a Boar’s Head deli meat plant, federal health officials said Wednesday. 
At least 59 people in 19 states have been sickened by the bacteria first detected in liverwurst made at the Jarratt, Virginia, plant. Illnesses were reported between late May and late August, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. All of those who fell ill were hospitalized. 
The latest fatality was reported in New York, bringing the total deaths to two each in New York and South Carolina and one each in Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee and New Mexico.
The Sarasota, Florida-based company announced on Sept. 13 that it was closing the Jarratt plant and discontinuing production of liverwurst. The moves came after inspection reports revealed problems including mold, insects, dripping water and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment dating back at least two years. 
Boar’s Head faces multiple lawsuits related to the deaths and illnesses. 
The plant hasn’t operated since late July, when officials with the U.S. Agriculture Department suspended inspections and the firm recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli meats because of potential contamination. 
Boar’s Head officials have said they “regret and deeply apologize” for contamination in their products. 
Listeria infections are caused by a hardy type of bacteria that can survive and even thrive during refrigeration. An estimated 1,600 people get listeria food poisoning each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC. Infections can be hard to pinpoint because symptoms may occur up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Former Venezuelan presidential candidate Edmundo González arrived in Spain on Sunday after fleeing into exile in as part of a negotiated deal with Nicolás Maduro’s government that dealt a major blow to millions who placed their hopes in his opposition campaign.
The surprise departure of the man considered by Venezuela’s opposition and several foreign governments to be the legitimate winner of July 28 presidential election was announced late Saturday by Venezuelan officials who just a few days ago ordered his arrest.
González landed Sunday at a military airport near Madrid, accompanied by his wife and Spanish officials. Hours later, he sent a short voice message to supporters thanking them for their support.
“My departure from Caracas was surrounded by acts of pressure, coercion and threats,” he said. “I trust that we will soon continue our fight to achieve our freedom and the restoration of Venezuela’s democracy.”
Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado tried to put a positive spin on his departure, assuring Venezuelans the 75-year-old retired diplomat would be back on Jan. 10 for a swearing-in ceremony marking the start of the next presidential term.
“His life was in danger, and the increasing threats, summons, arrest warrants and even attempts at blackmail and coercion to which he has been subjected, demonstrate that the regime has no scruples,” Machado said on X. “Let this be very clear to everyone: Edmundo will fight from outside alongside our diaspora.”
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024
But on the streets of Caracas on Sunday the mood was one of despair at the loss of someone who, against the odds, reignited a movement to end more than two decades of single party rule.


“What little hope we had left, it went with him,” said Laura Vargas, as she scrolled through the news on her cellphone while sitting on a park bench.
González joins the swelling ranks of opposition stalwarts who once fought Maduro only to throw in the towel and seek asylum abroad in the face of a brutal crackdown. In Spain, he joins at least four former presidential hopefuls who were imprisoned or faced arrest for defying Maduro’s rule.
Ever since the vote, he and Machado have been in hiding as security forces rounded up more than 2,000 people, many of them young Venezuelans who spontaneously took to the streets to protest Maduro’s alleged theft of the election.
Venezuelan officials have yet to comment. Vice President Delcy Rodríguez said in a statement late Saturday that the government decided to grant González safe passage out of the country to help restore “the country’s political peace and tranquility.”
Spain’s center-left government said the decision to leave Venezuela was González’s alone, and he departed on a plane sent by the country’s air force. González had sought refuge in the Dutch ambassador’s residence in Caracas after the election, the Netherlands’ government said Sunday, as he secretly negotiated his exit.
Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares told Spanish broadcaster RTVE that his government will grant González political asylum as he requested.
“Of course, I told him we were pleased that he is well and on his way to Spain, and I reiterated the commitment of our government to the political rights of all Venezuelans,” Albares said while en route to China for a state visit with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.
The European Union’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister, described González’s departure as “a sad day for democracy in Venezuela.”
Referring to González as the apparent winner of the presidential elections, Borrell in a statement said the ”EU will maintain its support of the Venezuelan people in their democratic aspirations.”
González was a last-minute stand-in after Machado was banned from running. Previously unknown to most Venezuelans, he nonetheless rapidly galvanized the hopes of millions of Venezuelans desperate for change after a decade-long economic free fall.
While Maduro was declared the winner of the July vote, most Western governments, including Spain, have yet to recognize his victory and are instead demanding that authorities publish a breakdown of votes. Meanwhile, tally sheets collected by opposition volunteers from over two-thirds of the electronic voting machines indicate that González won by a more than 2-to-1 margin.
The tally sheets have long been considered the ultimate proof of election results in Venezuela. In previous presidential elections, the National Electoral Council published online the results of each of the more than 30,000 voting machines, but the Maduro-controlled panel did not release any data this time, blaming an alleged cyberattack mounted by opponents from North Macedonia.
Attorney General Tarek William Saab, a staunch Maduro ally, sought González’s arrest after he failed to appear three times in connection with a criminal investigation into what it considers an act of electoral sabotage.
Saab told reporters that the voting records the opposition shared online were forged and an attempt to undermine the National Electoral Council. On Wednesday, González’s attorney delivered a letter to Saab in which he seemed to distance himself from the opposition’s publication of the voting records, saying it wasn’t his responsibility.
Experts from the United Nations and the Carter Center, which observed the election at the invitation of Maduro’s government, determined the results announced by electoral authorities lacked credibility. In a statement critical of the election, the U.N. experts stopped short of validating the opposition’s claim to victory, but they said the voting records it published online appear to exhibit all of the original security features.
Spain has been a major point of exodus for Venezuelans, particularly those leading opposition to Maduro’s regime. They include Leopoldo López, who fled to Spain to reunite with his family in 2020, and Antonio Ledezma, who left in 2017.
Some 44,000 Venezuelans immigrated to Spain in the first six months of this year. The last government statistics from 2022 said that some 212,000 Venezuelans lived in Spain.
“The truth is he’s more useful fighting abroad than in hiding or imprisoned,” said Gustavo Tovar-Arroyo, a human rights activist who was himself forced to flee into exile in 2012.

Florida State fell out of The Associated Press college football poll on Tuesday after starting the season 0-2, becoming just the third team to go from preseason top 10 to unranked in the first regular-season poll since the rankings expanded to 25 in 1989.
Georgia remained No. 1, receiving 57 first-place votes after starting the season with a blowout of then-No. 14 Clemson. The Tigers hung on at No. 25, but it was the second straight year they dropped at least 10 spots after losing their season opener.
Ohio State was No. 2 with five first-place votes. No. 3 Texas and No. 4 Alabama each moved up a spot, putting three Southeastern Conference teams in the top four along with Georgia. The last time the SEC did that in a non-pandemic season was Sept. 22, 2019.
No. 5 Notre Dame jumped two spots after opening the season with a victory at then-No. 20 Texas A&M, which fell out of the rankings.
Florida State has been the early season’s major disappointment. The defending Atlantic Coast Conference champion lost in Dublin, Ireland, to ACC rival Georgia Tech and then dropped another league game Monday night at home to Boston College.
No other preseason Top 25 team this year lost to an unranked opponent to open the season. Florida State did it twice as a double-digit favorite and did not receive a single vote from the AP poll panel.
The other preseason top-10 teams to fall all the way out of the Top 25 after Week 1 in the past 35 years were Michigan in 2007 after famously losing to Appalachian State as No. 5 and Clemson in 2008. The Tigers were No. 9 but opened with a blowout loss to Alabama and tumbled out of the rankings.


Mississippi remained at No. 6. Oregon slipped four spots to No. 7 after winning a close game with Idaho. Penn State stayed at No. 8. Missouri moved up two spots to No. 9 to give the SEC five teams in the top 10. Michigan dropped one spot to No. 10.
Georgia Tech’s 2-0 start has the No. 23 Yellow Jackets ranked for the first time since 2015.
Because Florida State started its season a week before most of the country, it moves into an exclusive club of teams that began their seasons 0-2 with each loss coming while ranked in the top 10.
Notre Dame was the last to do it in 2022, when the Fighting Irish began the season No. 5, lost at No. 2 Ohio State in their opener, and then were beaten at home the next week by Marshall while ranked eighth. The Irish went to on finish 9-4.
Ohio State opened the 1986 season ranked ninth and lost back-to-back games to ranked opponents, No. 5 Alabama and No. 17 Washington. The Buckeyes were No. 10 when they played the Huskies. Ohio State finished 10-3.
The 1967 Texas team and TCU from 1952 also started 0-2 while ranked in the top 10 in both games.
Florida State is only the second ranked team to lose twice before the first regular-season poll was released, joining Kentucky in 1951. The Wildcats went from No. 6 to No. 17 while going 1-2 to start the season, losing at No. 11 Texas and at Mississippi.
Florida State gets a weekend off before resuming its schedule with home games against Memphis and new ACC member California before a trip to SMU followed by a home game against Clemson.
“You’ve got a football team that nobody envisioned ever being where we are and having disappointment, having failure, but I do believe in what this team can do,” coach Mike Norvell said after the BC loss. “I believe in what this team can accomplish.”
The big movers upward in the Top 25 were Miami and Southern California.
The Hurricanes jumped seven spots to No. 12 after routing Florida at The Swamp and have their best ranking since cracking the top 10 late in the 2020 season.
No. 13 USC moved up 10 places after beating LSU with a late touchdown Sunday night in Las Vegas. LSU dropped to No. 18.
The Trojans started last season at No. 6, but ended up unranked after a disappointing 8-5 season with 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams.
The only other team to move into the rankings this week, along with Georgia Tech, was fellow ACC school Louisville. The Cardinals were among the top unranked voter-getters in the preseason and now sit at No. 22.
Despite Florida State and Clemson starting the season 0-3, the ACC has one more team in this week’s rankings than it did last time:
SEC — 8 (Nos. 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 14, 16, 18).
Big Ten — 6 (Nos. 2, 7, 8, 10, 13, 21).
ACC — 5 (Nos. 12, 22, 23, 24, 25).
Big 12 — 5 (Nos. 11, 16, 17, 19, 20).
Independent — 1 (No. 5).
No. 3 Texas at No. 10 Michigan. The first regular-season meeting ever is a top-10 matchup at the Big House.
No. 14 Tennessee vs. No. 24 N.C. State in Charlotte, North Carolina. Interesting SEC-ACC ranked matchup.

CLEVELAND (AP) — Lane Thomas hit a two-run homer and drove in three, Josh Naylor had a pair of RBIs, and the AL Central champion Cleveland Guardians clinched a first-round bye in the postseason with a 6-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night.
Tanner Bibee (12-8) allowed one run on four hits over seven innings to win for the first time at home since July 19. The right-hander struck out seven in what could be his final outing until Game 1 of the ALDS.
Cleveland earned a five-day break between the end of the regular season and the start of the division series on Oct. 5 at Progressive Field.
“Getting these days off is going to give us a lot of rejuvenation, especially for a young team,” Bibee said. “Now, we’re going to be here at home for like two weeks in a row. It’s going to be nice.”
Thomas and Kyle Manzardo both went deep against Carson Spiers (5-7) in a three-run first as the Guardians improved their AL-best home record to 49-28. They have the second-best overall mark in the AL, 1 1/2 games behind the New York Yankees.
Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said he will treat the next four games the same way as the first 158, but admitted, “We might give guys a day off.”
“We’ve said from the beginning that we think we can play with anybody –- and these guys have proved it,” the first-year skipper said. “It’s incredible, so great for them. We couldn’t be happier about this opportunity.”


The Reds made their debut under interim manager Freddie Benavides, who was promoted Sunday after David Bell was fired. Benavides’ only managerial experience was four years in the minors for Cincinnati, most recently in 2007 at Single-A Billings.
With the loss, Cincinnati was assured of finishing with a losing record for the eighth time in 10 seasons.
Spencer Steer had an RBI single in the fourth, plating Tyler Stephenson, for the Reds’ final hit. Leadoff hitter Jonathan India was struck on the helmet by a pitch in the fifth, but remained in the game for two more innings.
Hunter Gaddis and AL saves leader Emmanuel Clase retired all six batters they faced to complete the four-hitter for the Guardians.
“Bibee kept us off-balance and he kept balls off the barrel, basically,” Benavides said. “Those two guys at the end are pretty good, too. It’s a solid, solid staff they have on that side.”
Spiers gave up three runs in four innings. Ian Gibaut followed in his first major league appearance since Sept. 30, 2023, working one inning and allowing one run.
Reds: RHP Julian Aguiar (right elbow sprain), who was scheduled to start Wednesday, was placed on the injured list after being hurt during a throwing session. Aguiar did not travel to Cleveland in order to undergo an MRI.
Guardians: OF Steven Kwan (mid-back inflammation) took swings in the batting cage and Vogt said he will be activated during the homestand. The All-Star left fielder was eligible to come off the IL on Tuesday.
Reds RHP Jakob Junis (4-0, 2.61 ERA) takes on Guardians LHP Joey Cantillo (2-3, 4.63 ERA) in the two-game series finale. Trade deadline acquisition Junis was scratched from starting the opener for personal reasons.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — A landslide caused by heavy rains has killed six people near Mexico City, authorities said.
The landslide on Monday night in Naucalpan, a community northwest of Mexico City, also affected a house and school, the State of Mexico government said in a statement. The victims were four men and two women. Another three people were injured and transported to a state hospital.
State Gov. Delfina Gómez ordered the deployment of rescue teams and security task forces to support affected families.
The deaths in Naucalpan occurred a few days after another landslide killed nine people on Saturday in Jilotzingo, west of Mexico City in the State of Mexico. A 3-month-old baby was among the victims. Two children, ages 10 and 12, and a 34-year-old woman were rescued. Several homes were affected and authorities had to evacuate more than 100 people for fear of further landslides.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Liover Peguero slashed a two-run double, Luis Ortiz pitched seven strong innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 on Wednesday night.
Ortiz (7-6) allowed one run on four hits with a walk and five strikeouts in seven innings. His only mistake was a second-inning pitch to Jake Bauers that Milwaukee’s designated hitter sent to the seats in right-center for his 12th homer of the season.
Peguero led all Pirates minor leaguers this season in hits, RBIs and doubles before being called up on Tuesday after Pittsburgh s urprisingly released first baseman Rowdy Tellez. The shortstop laced a ball to the notch in left-center against Freddy Peralta (11-9) in the fifth that drove in Yasmani Grandal and Nick Yorke, both of whom reached base after working full-count walks.
“When you work really hard and then you see the results, the results that you’ve be looking for, you just get excited,” Peguero said. “Right now, I just want more. I’m going to continue to keep improving out there and give everything I have, which is really exciting.”
Isiah Kiner-Falefa had the other two hits for Pittsburgh, a clean single in the fourth and an infield hit in the eighth. Aroldis Chapman recorded his 12th save after left fielder Bryan Reynolds threw out Willy Adames with two outs in the ninth when Adames tried to stretch a single into a double.
Ortiz, who began the season as a long reliever, has put together a compelling case that he deserves to stay in the rotation in 2025, a rotation that will include rookie sensation Paul Skenes. 


“After we broke camp and they told me I was going to be in the bullpen, all that was in my mind was to try and help the team in as many ways as possible,” said Ortiz, who will finish the year with a 3.32 ERA. “Whatever happens after that, it happens. The other thing I was focused on was to just work hard and give the team a good shot to win.” 
The right-hander has developed a deeper repertoire this season, adding a cutter to the mix that has helped him become more effective.
“That’s a new pitch,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “For how much it played and how much he was able to make that pitch better during a major league season is something that’s really important.”
Rhys Hoskins, William Contreras and Sal Frelick all singled for the NL Central champion Brewers, who are readying for their sixth playoff appearance in the last seven years.
Peralta has been among the major reasons why Milwaukee is heading back to the postseason. The 28-year-old right-hander has been a fixture near the top of the Brewers’ rotation that has seen 17 different players start at least one game.
“You talk about a pillar,” Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said. “We call those guys our pillars. But he did it on the field, too. He showed every single start and he gave us everything he got.”
Peralta was in October form for most of the night against Pittsburgh, retiring the first nine batters he faced. He ran into trouble with two outs in the fifth, which also happened to come when he was one strikeout away from reaching 200 for a second straight season. The 28-year-old admitted he was chasing the milestone against Grandal, Yorke and Peguero and it cost him.
“One of his better outings except for that little three-batter stretch where there’s two outs and he’s trying to punch guys out,” Murphy said. “Hopefully he learned a lesson.”
Murphy let Peralta go out for the top of the sixth, then pulled him after Peralta fanned Reynolds to get to 200. Next up is a bit of rest before the playoffs begin.
“I’m in a great position right now,” Peralta said. “I feel great. Awesome.”
The series wraps up on Thursday in Pittsburgh’s home finale. Aaron Civale (7-9, 4.53 ERA) starts for Milwaukee. Mitch Keller (11-11, 4.21) will make his final start of the season for the Pirates.

NEW YORK (AP) — Gunnar Henderson had three of Baltimore’s 12 hits in the first four innings, and the Orioles again prevented the New York Yankees from clinching the AL East title by holding on for a 9-7 victory Wednesday night despite another home run from Aaron Judge.
Colton Cowser drove in three runs for the playoff-bound Orioles, who dinged substitute starter Marcus Stroman early and improved to 8-4 against New York with one matchup left in their season series.
“We’re just focusing on us,” Henderson said. “I feel like we’re starting to get it going at the right time.”
Judge went deep for the fourth game in a row, connecting on his major league-leading 57th homer in a four-run ninth inning. 
The three-run shot off Matt Bowman upped Judge’s career-best total to 142 RBIs, also most in the majors, and shaved New York’s deficit to 9-7.
“No quit in the team there all the way till the end,” Judge said. “I never feel like we’re ever out of a game no matter the score.” 
Keegan Akin retired the next two batters for his third career save and first this year. 
Juan Soto also homered and knocked in three runs for New York, which could have wrapped up the AL East race with a victory over the Orioles either of the past two nights. Anthony Volpe had an RBI single.
“Nothing’s been easy for us this year. Shouldn’t expect it to be now. But we’ve kind of persevered and kind of grinded our way through all of it,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “We’ll be ready to go tomorrow.”


Baltimore moved within four games of the Yankees in the division standings with four remaining. Cedric Mullins went 3 for 4 with a walk, three runs scored and two stolen bases.
Assured at least an American League wild card, the second-place Orioles secured their second consecutive trip to the postseason Tuesday night when their 5-3 win at Yankee Stadium was paired with Minnesota’s loss to Miami nine minutes later.
Baltimore enjoyed a booze-filled bash in the visitors’ clubhouse afterward, but it was the Yankees who appeared a little hungover Wednesday.
Stroman (10-9) was a late replacement for injured left-hander Nestor Cortes and gave up six straight singles to begin the game — several of them not hit very hard — as the Orioles grabbed a 3-0 lead. 
Rookie outfielder Jasson Domínguez overran Cowser’s two-run single, a flyball that fell in the left-field corner. 
“He’s missed some plays that he should make,” Boone said.
Domínguez, a natural center fielder, said he lost the ball at the end.
“I have no excuse. That ball has to be caught like 100% of the time,” he said.
Ryan Mountcastle followed with an RBI single. Henderson’s two-run single with one out in the fourth chased Stroman from his first start since Sept. 10. He gave up 10 of Baltimore’s 17 hits — 14 were singles — and was charged with six runs.
Anthony Santander and Cowser added consecutive RBI doubles later in the inning.
“Right away just really good at-bats from the first inning,” Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. “We had a lot of clutch hits, kept the line moving. Thought our at-bats all night were really good and you can never score enough here. We almost saw it. So it was a great night for us offensively.”
Stroman had been moved to the bullpen for the final two weeks of the season because the Yankees had six healthy starters before Cortes went down. The veteran right-hander threw 64 pitches for a three-inning save Sept. 17 in Seattle. 
Handed an 8-1 lead, Orioles starter Zach Eflin walked a career-high five and was pulled after 4 2/3 innings. Jacob Webb (2-5) retired Jazz Chisholm Jr. with the bases loaded to end the fifth and worked 1 1/3 scoreless innings.
“It was a great win,” Eflin said. “Offense had my back.”
Orioles: RHP Grayson Rodriguez will miss the postseason because of right lat discomfort.
Yankees: Cortes had been scheduled to start, but he was scratched and placed on the 15-day injured list with a flexor strain in his pitching elbow. He and the Yankees are holding out hope he could return at some point in the postseason, but it didn’t sound likely.
A matchup of Cy Young Award winners Thursday night, when Baltimore RHP Corbin Burnes (15-8, 2.95 ERA) faces Gerrit Cole (7-5, 3.67) to conclude the three-game series.
In his only previous start at Yankee Stadium, Burnes threw eight hitless innings for Milwaukee last September. The right-hander has a 1.08 ERA this month and will try to become the first Orioles pitcher to win 16 games in a season since Chris Tillman in 2016. 
Cole went nine innings for the win last time out in Oakland, allowing one run and two hits with seven strikeouts.

Publication date:2024-09-11 07:00:00

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Receiver Puka Nacua, guard Steve Avila and offensive tackle Joe Noteboom were placed on injured reserve Wednesday by the Los Angeles Rams, and coach Sean McVay acknowledged all three players could be out longer than four games.
Even with the Rams’ bye week providing a fifth week of recovery into mid-October for the trio, McVay isn’t sure when his team will be whole again after a series of significant injury setbacks already this season.
“Each of those three guys have unique injuries that, as of right now, it could keep them out longer than that,” McVay said. “And so we’ll see. ... Let’s not place expectations on when they’re going to come back, because these guys are so conscientious. Let’s allow them to be ready to go whenever their body says, and when the doctors do say. I know they’re going to accelerate it and be ready as quickly as possible.”
When asked if this season already feels a bit like the Rams’ injury-ruined Super Bowl title defense season in 2022, McVay replied flatly and sarcastically: “I don’t remember that year.”
Nacua aggravated a sprained ligament in his right knee during the first half of Los Angeles’ 26-20 overtime loss at Detroit last weekend. The Rams were still competitive while players went down left and right with injuries, and they even scored 17 consecutive points down the stretch before the Lions’ offense took control.
McVay said he threw out his entire offensive game plan and worked with Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp on new ways to move the ball without their starting offensive line — and it almost worked.


“The game was such an outlier for how we had to play, how we had to adjust,” McVay said. “I’ve never been a part of circumstances quite like that, but that’s also probably as proud as I’ve been of a group’s ability to adjust. The guys seamlessly handled that.”

The long-term absence of Nacua, the most productive rookie receiver in NFL history last season, leaves another major hole in a unit already playing behind a patchwork offensive line.
Avila sprained a ligament in his knee in the first half in Detroit, while Noteboom sprained his ankle. The Rams already were playing without both of their starting offensive tackles: Left tackle Alaric Jackson is suspended for one more week, and right tackle Rob Havenstein is hoping to return after missing the season opener with a persistent ankle injury, although he was quite limited in practice Wednesday.
What’s more, right guard Kevin Dotson missed practice to rest his sprained ankle, although the Rams are optimistic he’ll play when they travel to Arizona on Sunday hoping to avoid the franchise’s first 0-2 start to a season since 2011.
The Rams are filling their roster gaps with newcomers, signing offensive lineman Dylan McMahon off Philadelphia’s practice squad and adding veteran offensive lineman Geron Christian. Los Angeles also re-signed two former Rams to the practice squad this week, reuniting with cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon and offensive tackle Ty Nsekhe.
Cornerback Cobie Durant also missed Wednesday’s practice with an injured toe. Since the Rams already are without starting cornerback Darious Williams on injured reserve, they re-signed Witherspoon, an eight-year NFL veteran who made three interceptions while starting all 17 games for the Rams last season.
McMahon is a rookie chosen in the sixth round by the Eagles last spring, and McVay said the Rams had their eye on the N.C. State product all year.
Christian played in 58 games over the past six seasons with Washington, Houston, Kansas City and Cleveland. He started nine games at left tackle last season for the Browns, and he spent this year’s training camp and preseason with Tennessee before being released late last month.
Nsehkhe started eight games for the Rams in that ill-fated 2022 season before spending last year with Cleveland. The veteran tackle, who turns 39 next month, played for the St. Louis Rams in 2012, and he also played for McVay when the coach was Washington’s offensive coordinator in 2015 and 2016.
“I thought he played really well in ‘22,” McVay said. “He’s timeless. He’s still doing his thing.”

Publication date:2024-09-26 17:07:00

McALESTER, Okla. (AP) — Oklahoma executed a man Thursday for his role in the 1992 fatal shooting of a convenience store owner after the governor again rejected a recommendation from the state’s parole board to spare a death row inmate’s life.
Emmanuel Littlejohn, 52, received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and was declared dead at 10:17 a.m. 
“A jury found him guilty and sentenced him to death,” Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement explaining why he declined to commute Littlejohn’s sentence to life in prison without parole. “As a law and order governor, I have a hard time unilaterally overturning that decision.” 
Stitt has granted clemency only once out of the five times that the parole board has recommended it during Stitt’s nearly six years in office. Oklahoma has carried out 14 executions under Stitt, having resumed them in 2021 after a more than six-year hiatus. 
In voting 3-2 last month to recommend clemency, the board appeared to be moved by questions Littlejohn’s lawyers raised about whether he or a co-defendant fired the shot that killed Kenneth Meers. Littlejohn’s attorneys also suggested the jury was unclear about whether a sentence of life without parole would guarantee someone would never be released.
His lethal injection came just two days after the execution of Marcellus Williams in Missouri, where advocates insisted Williams was innocent.


Strapped to a gurney and with an IV line in his right arm, Littlejohn looked toward his mother and daughter, who witnessed the execution.
“Mom, you OK?” Littlejohn asked. 
“I’m OK,” his mother, Ceily Mason, responded.
“Everything is going to be OK. I love you,” he said.
Mason sobbed quietly and clutched a cross necklace during the lethal injection, which began shortly after 10 a.m. Littlejohn’s breathing became labored before a doctor declared him unconscious at 10:07 a.m. He was pronounced dead 10 minutes later.
Littlejohn’s spiritual advisor, the Rev. Jeff Hood, was inside the death chamber and prayed over him.
Steven Harpe, the director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, said the lethal injection went without any problems.
If an execution set for Thursday evening in Alabama is carried out, it would mark the first time in decades that five death row inmates were put to death in the U.S. within one week. The five executions would also mark another grim milestone — 1,600 executions since the death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Littlejohn was 20 when prosecutors say he and co-defendant Glenn Bethany robbed the Root-N-Scoot convenience store in south Oklahoma City in June 1992. 
During video testimony to the Pardon and Parole Board in early August, Littlejohn apologized to Meers’ family but denied firing the fatal shot. Littlejohn’s attorneys pointed out that the same prosecutor tried Bethany and Littlejohn in separate trials using a nearly identical theory, even though there was only one shooter and one bullet that killed Meers, 31.
But prosecutors told the board that two teenage store employees who witnessed the robbery both said Littlejohn, not Bethany, fired the fatal shot. Bethany was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
Littlejohn’s attorneys also argued that killings resulting from a robbery are rarely considered death penalty cases and that prosecutors today would not have pursued the ultimate punishment.
“It is evident that Emmanuel would not have been sentenced to death if he’d been tried in 2024 or even 2004,” attorney Caitlin Hoeberlein told the board.
Littlejohn was prosecuted by former Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy, who was known for his zealous pursuit of the death penalty and secured 54 death sentences during more than 20 years in office.
Stitt previously asked one of his appointees to the parole board, Adam Luck, to step down after Luck voted several times to recommend clemency.
The only time Stitt has granted clemency was in 2021, when he commuted Julius Jones’ death sentence to life without parole just hours before Jones was scheduled to receive a lethal injection. Stitt has denied clemency recommendations from the board in three other cases: Bigler Stouffer, James Coddington and Phillip Hancock, all of whom were executed.
A state appellate court on Wednesday denied a last-minute legal challenge from Littlejohn’s attorneys to the constitutionality of the state’s lethal injection method of execution. A similar appeal filed in federal court also was rejected Thursday.",True,Emmanuel Littlejohn,Emmanuel Littlejohn,Emmanuel Littlejohn,"Richard Glossip

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Royals’ late-season losing streak stretched to five on Friday night with a 2-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants, who got three hits from Heliot Ramos.
Kansas City dropped four games behind Baltimore for the first AL wild card spot and saw its lead cut to one game over Minnesota for the second of the three wild cards.
“You’ve got to make your own breaks,” Royals manager Matt Quatraro said. “We had every opportunity to hit a ball in the gap or a line drive through the middle. We’ve got to keep putting ourselves in the opportunities to get guys on base and force the action. Hopefully we break through.”
Mason Black (1-4) pitched shutout ball over a career-high 5 2/3 innings for already eliminated San Francisco, limiting the Royals to four hits. 
“He pitched great,” San Francisco manager Bob Melvin said. “He seems like the last few times he’s been a little bit more comfortable and confident with what he’s doing out there.”
Camilo Doval allowed Garrett Hampson’s sacrifice fly before striking out Tommy Pham with runners on second and third to get his 23rd save in 28 chances.
“That was a little stressful, but he got out of it,” Melvin said.
Hampson came close to a bases-clearing double down the left-field line that would have won the game with one out in the ninth, but the ball was ruled foul. Quatraro asked to challenge the ruling but was denied.


“I was surprised it was called foul,” Quatraro said. “I didn’t have a great angle from where I was sitting, but they called it foul and it’s not reviewable.”
Quatraro felt like the ball was behind third-base umpire John Bacon, but he was told that the replay umpire in New York said it wasn’t.
“I’ve argued that one a million times,” Melvin said. “You can’t review it unless it’s behind him.”
Kansas City went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position and stranded nine runners, including three runners in scoring position in the first two innings.
“You want to score every time you get those opportunities,” Quatraro said. “It just didn’t go our way.”
“We hit the ball hard but didn’t have anything to show for it,” Adam Frazier said. “We just need a timely hit or two. The pitchers kept us in the game.”
Michael Wacha (13-8) gave up two runs on six hits in 5 2/3 innings, dropping to 9-2 in 15 starts since June 22.
“I feel like they made me work, especially in the first,” Wacha said. “I feel like I was able to settle in there, but the sixth was frustrating.”
Mike Yastrzemski led off the first with a bloop single, advanced to second on a walk and to third on a flyout, then scored on Ramos’ infield hit.
Ramos hit a two-out double to the wall in right-center in the sixth and scored on Patrick Bailey’s single for a 2-0 lead.
Giants right-hander Jordan Hicks was placed on the 15-day injured list retroactive to Tuesday with right-shoulder inflammation and right-hander Austin Warren was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento.
In a game moved up to 4:10 p.m. CDT because of a forecast of bad weather, San Francisco RHP Landen Roupp (0-1, 3.02 ERA) is to start Saturday against Kansas CIty RHP Brady Singer (9-11, 3.53 ERA).

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Ronel Blanco threw six scoreless innings, Jason Heyward had a home run among his three hits and the Houston Astros finished off a three-game sweep of the Los Angeles Angels with a 6-4 victory on Sunday.
Jeremy Peña had two hits and two runs scored as the Astros won their fourth consecutive game and remained 4 1/2 games ahead of the Seattle Mariners in the American League West.
Blanco (11-6) allowed two walks and had five strikeouts in his return to the starting rotation after pitching two innings of scoreless relief Sept. 7 against Arizona. Blanco was used out of the bullpen for a game to manage his usage in his first full season in the majors.
“The thing that helped me a ton was being able to have that rest before this outing,” Blanco said through an interpreter.
Josh Hader recorded the final two outs for his 31st save in 33 opportunities.
Despite just 52 appearances and 34 starts since 2022, Blanco is expected to play a key role into October.
“Looking at the second half, I was looking at the things I was doing wrong and the things I could make better,” Blanco said. “The fastball was one (area of improvement). I thought I was missing up way too much with the fastball. I told myself to attack the strike zone more.”
Taylor Ward hit a home run and rookie Eric Wagaman had two hits for the Angels, who lost their fifth consecutive game and fell for the seventh time in their last eight. The Angels dropped to 60-89, matching their loss total from the 2022 and 2023 seasons. 


Angels rookie right-hander Caden Dana (1-2) went 3 1/3 innings in his third career start, giving up five runs on five hits with two walks and three strikeouts.
“The only ball they got in the air, of all the hits they got, was the one Heyward hit,” Angels manager Ron Washington said of Dana’s outing. “You want the ball down on the ground and today they found the holes. He was a little flat with his fastball but he had a good changeup working.”
In his fourth game in the starting lineup since debuting with the Astros on Sept. 1, Heyward hit a home run, his eighth, in his first at bat to give Houston a 1-0 lead in the third.
“If (Heyward) gets a pitch in an area he likes it, he’s not going to miss,” Astros manager Joe Espada said. “He hits the ball hard and he plays hard too. That’s something that I have always admired from Jason.”
Heyward, who was released by the Los Angeles Dodgers on Aug. 24, reached base a fourth time after getting aboard on catcher’s interference in the eighth inning.
“It’s nice to have a job with a team competing to win and wanting to win a World Series,” Heyward said. “That really does make a difference because that is hard. It’s hard to be the last team standing. So it’s just nice to step into another clubhouse with that mentality, that mindset and experience.”
Heyward had an RBI single in a four-run fourth that also included RBI singles from Peña and Mauricio Dubon. Peña scored a run in the inning on a passed ball by Angels catcher Logan O’Hoppe.
Jake Meyers gave the Astros a 6-0 lead in the eighth on an RBI single to right. Ward ended the Astros’ shutout bid with his home run in the eighth off Kaleb Ort, his 24th.
The Angels scored three times in the ninth with all three runs charged to left-hander Caleb Ferguson. Gustavo Campero had a run-scoring ground out in his major league debut and Charles Leblanc had a two-run single.
Astros pitching coach Joshua Miller was ejected by third base umpire Dan Iassogna for arguing a hit-by-pitch call in the bottom of the ninth.
Astros: OF Ben Gamel was not in the lineup after sustaining a knee contusion in Saturday’s game. ... OF Kyle Tucker made his second start in right field since returning Sept. 6 from a right shin fracture. ... 1B Jon Singleton was a late scratch with an illness and was replaced by Victor Caratini.
Angels: OF Mickey Moniak was hit by a pitch on his left hand in the ninth and left the game. ... An MRI on the right shoulder of RHP Ben Joyce revealed only inflammation but the team still will shut down the reliever, whose last pitch of the season on Sept. 3 was a 105.5-mph fastball. ... RHP Carson Fulmer (right elbow inflammation) was reinstated from the injured list, while both OF Bryce Teodosio (right middle finger fracture) and LHP Sam Aldegheri (left middle finger blister) were placed on the IL.
Astros: RHP Spencer Arrighetti (7-12, 4.72 ERA) is scheduled to pitch in the opener of a three-game road series against the San Diego Padres.
Angels: LHP Reid Detmers (4-6, 5.64 ERA) is scheduled to pitch in the opener of a three-game road series against the Chicago White Sox.

Over 140 Ukrainian drones targeted multiple Russian regions overnight, including Moscow and surrounding areas, killing at least one person and injuring eight, officials said Tuesday, in one of the biggest drone attacks on Russian soil in the 2 1/2-year war.
A woman died in the town of Ramenskoye, just outside Moscow, where drones hit two multistory residential buildings and started fires, Moscow region Gov. Andrei Vorobyov said. Five residential buildings were evacuated due to falling drone debris, Vorobyov said.
The attack also prompted the authorities to shut three airports just outside Moscow — Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky — forcing 48 flights to be diverted to other airports, according to Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia. 
The first two airports, which are Russia’s second- and third-busiest, reopened in the morning but Zhukovsky was still closed in the afternoon because law enforcement officers were dealing with drone debris there, an airport spokesperson told the Interfax news agency.
It was the second massive Ukrainian drone attack on Russia this month. On Sept. 1, the Russian military said it intercepted 158 Ukrainian drones over more than a dozen Russian regions in what Russian media described as the biggest Ukrainian drone barrage since the start of the war. Russia’s Investigative Committee announced a criminal investigation into what it described as a terror attack.
Russia has pummeled Ukraine with missiles, glide bombs and its own drones, killing over 10,000 civilians since the war began in 2022, according to the United Nations.


Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 46 Shahed drones and two missiles at Ukraine overnight. The air force said it downed 36 of the drones.
Ukraine has invested a lot of effort in developing domestic drone production, extending drones’ range, payload and uses. It has increasingly utilized drone blitzes to slow Russia’s war machine, disrupt Russian society and provoke the Kremlin.
Ukrainian officials have complained that weapons pledged by the country’s Western partners fall short of what their military needs and commonly arrive long after promised. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged defense companies to increase their output.
On the battlefield’s 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, Ukrainian troops are up against Russia’s larger and better-equipped army. The two sides are especially contesting parts of eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, fighting over towns and villages that are bombed-out wrecks, while Ukraine last month launched a bold incursion into Russia’s Kursk border region.
In Moscow on Monday night, drone debris fell on a private house on the outskirts of the city, but no one was hurt, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. He counted over a dozen drones heading toward Moscow that were shot down by air defenses as they were approaching the city.
Overall, Russia’s Defense Ministry said it “intercepted and destroyed” 144 Ukrainian drones over nine Russian regions, including those on the border with Ukraine and those deeper inside Russia.
Ukrainian officials declined to comment on the attack.
As the war drags on, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been expanding his alliances:
The Russian military on Tuesday began massive naval and air drills, involving over 90,000 troops and over 400 warships, that China will also take part in, the Defense Ministry said.
Putin is also beefing up his military arsenal with Iranian ballistic missiles, the United States and Britain said Tuesday.
Moscow and the surrounding region have often come under attack throughout the war.
In May 2023, Russian officials said Ukraine tried to attack the Kremlin with drones which lightly damaged the roof of the palace that includes one of Putin’s official residences.
In August 2023, a drone attack on Moscow’s prestigious business district blew out part of a section of windows on a high-rise building and sent glass cascading to the streets, unsettling Muscovites. The attacks exposed gaps in the city and region’s air defenses.

PARIS (AP) — With his hair colored in a design reminiscent of the eyes in a Picasso painting, Team USA athletics captain Roderick Townsend was ready to go for a three-peat at the Paralympics.
“I’m a showman,” Townsend said, explaining the hairstyle he had done at a salon in Paris. “Had they been out there booing me? I’d probably still be jumping.”
Instead of booing, the Stade de France crowd followed Townsend’s every command, sitting quiet or cheering, as he won the T47 high jump finals on Sunday night, notching a 2.12-meter (6 feet, 11.5 inches) jump and collecting his third straight gold medal in the event. The T47 category is for competitors who have either lost part of an arm, or have low to moderate movement problems in one arm.
The 32-year-old Townsend, who has an upper right shoulder impairment after sustaining nerve damage at birth, considers himself the “bad guy,” going on a mission to be the “reason that nobody else gets to win.” He’ll get one more chance at that role Tuesday in the long jump. 
To win the high jump, Townsend had to outlast top competitor Nishad Kumar of India, who won silver in Tokyo Paralympics and finished second again in Paris. Kumar nearly reached the 2.12 mark in his three attempts, but clipped the bar each time. He lay in defeat on the high-jump mat for a long moment before Townsend came over to embrace him.
In that moment, Townsend, of Stockton, California, told Kumar that he’s “phenomenal” and he pushes Townsend to do great things because they are both so competitive. Townsend said following the race he has another goal in mind regarding Kumar: “I just want him to have as many silver medals as possible.”


After Townsend out-jumped Kumar, he went for more.
In the Tokyo games, Townsend broke the high jump record with a 2.15-meter jump before topping himself in the 2023 Paris World Championships with a 2.16-meter leap. This time, he was going for 2.17.
The crowd roared and clapped, but Townsend was ultimately unable to reset his record on Sunday, later revealing later he sustained a hernia while at the U.S. trials in July, and is still recovering.

PRAGUE (AP) — The death toll was rising in Central European countries on Sunday after days of heavy rains caused widespread flooding and forced evacuations.
Several Central European nations have already been hit by severe flooding, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania. Slovakia and Hungary might come next as a result of a low pressure system from northern Italy dumping record rainfall in the region since Thursday.
The floods have claimed six lives in Romania and one each in Austria and Poland. In the Czech Republic, four people who were swept away by waters were missing, police said.

Most parts of the Czech Republic have been affected as authorities declared the highest flood warnings at around 100 places across the country. But the situation was worst in two northeastern regions that recorded the biggest rainfall in recent days, including the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border.
In the city of Opava, up to 10,000 people out of a population of around 56,000 have been asked to move to higher ground. Rescuers used boats to transport people to safety in a neighborhood flooded by the raging Opava River.
“There’s no reason to wait,” Mayor Tomáš Navrátil told Czech public radio. He said that the situation was worse than during the last devastating floods in 1997, known as the “flood of the century.”
“We have to focus on saving lives,” Prime Minister Petr Fiala told Czech public television on Sunday. His government was set to meet Monday to assess the damages.


The worst “is not behind us yet,” the prime minister warned.
President Petr Pavel sounded more optimistic, saying “it’s obvious we’ve learned a lesson from the previous crisis.”

Thousands of others also were evacuated in the towns of Krnov, which was almost completely flooded, and Cesky Tesin. The Oder River that flows to Poland was reaching extreme levels in the city of Ostrava and in Bohumin, prompting evacuations.
Ostrava, the regional capital, is the third-largest Czech city. Mayor Jan Dohnal said the city will face major traffic disruptions in the days to come. Almost no trains were operating in the region.
Towns and villages in the Jeseniky mountains, including the local center of Jesenik, were inundated and isolated by raging waters that turned roads into rivers. The military sent a helicopter to help with evacuations. 
Jesenik Mayor Zdenka Blistanova told Czech public television that several houses in her and other nearby towns have been destroyed by the floods. A number of bridges and roads have been badly damaged.
About 260,000 households were without power Sunday morning in the entire country, while traffic was halted on many roads, including the major D1 highway.
A firefighter died after “slipping on stairs” while pumping out a flooded basement in the town of Tulln, the head of the fire department of Lower Austria, Dietmar Fahrafellner, told reporters on Sunday.
Authorities declared the entire state of Lower Austria in the northeastern part of the country a disaster zone, while 10,000 relief forces have so far evacuated 1,100 houses there. Emergency personnel have started setting up accommodation for residents who had to flee their homes due to the flooding.
The municipality of Lilienfeld with about 25,000 residents is cut off from the outside world. Residents were told to boil tap water as a precaution. 
The situation is particularly dangerous along the Kamp River, which flows into the Danube. The Ottenstein reservoir on the river functions as a buffer, but exceeding its limits could cause more flooding, experts say. 
Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the situation “continues to worsen.” He said 2,400 soldiers were ready to support the relief effort in Austria. Of those, 1,000 soldiers will deploy to the disaster zone in Lower Austria, where dams were beginning to burst.
“We are experiencing difficult and dramatic hours in Lower Austria. For many people in Lower Austria these will probably be the most difficult hours of their lives,” said Johanna Mikl-Leitner, the governor of Lower Austria.
In Vienna, the Wien River overflowed its banks, flooding homes and forcing first evacuations of nearby houses. 
Romanian authorities said Sunday that another two people had died in the hard-hit eastern county of Galati after four were reported dead there a day earlier, following unprecedented rain.
In Poland, one person was presumed dead in floods in the southwest, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday. 
Tusk said the situation was “dramatic” around the town of Klodzko, with about 25,000 residents, located in a valley in the Sudetes mountains near the border with the Czech Republic. Helicopters were used to pick up people from roofs in a few cases.
In Glucholazy, rising waters overflowed a river embankment and flooded streets and houses. Mayor Paweł Szymkowicz said, “we are drowning,” and appealed to residents to evacuate to high ground. 
A bridge in the town collapsed under the flood pressure and a police station building was knocked down in Stronie Śląskie, after floodwaters burst through a dam. Submerged cars could be seen in many places in the Kłodzko Valley region bordering the Czech Republic, while a new flood wave was expected there.
In the city of Jelenia Gora, which has 75,000 residents, downtown streets were flooded after one of the embankments burst on the Bobr River. City authorities have warned residents they may need to evacuate as more flooding was moving toward the city.
Energy supplies and communications were cut off in some flooded areas, and regions may resort to using the satellite-based Starlink service, Tusk said.
The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just a year ago.
A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.

Third-year linebacker Baylon Spector is making his first career start and handling the on-field defensive play-calling duties in place of Terrel Bernard, who is sidelined by pectoral injury. Spector had a team-high-tying 10 tackles in playing 62 of 75 defensive snaps against Miami after Bernard was hurt. Spector is now part of a new linebacker tandem, playing alongside Dorian Williams, who began the season filling in for Matt Milano, who’s out until at least early December with a torn left biceps.
Josh Hines-Allen, who added Hines to his last name earlier this year to honor his maternal family, is 2-0 against his former namesake Josh Allen. Hines-Allen dominated the matchup in 2021, finishing with eight tackles, a sack, an interception and a fumble return in Jacksonville. He was mostly a non-factor in London last year, finishing with a solo tackle. Hines-Allen has six tackles, including a sack, this season.


Jaguars O-Line vs. Greg Rousseau and Von Miller. Jacksonville has already allowed seven sacks, including a safety. Rousseau had three sacks in a season-opening win over Arizona. And Miller has a sack in each outing after failing to have one in 14 games, including playoffs, while coming off a torn knee ligament last season.

Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence is 2-0 against the Bills. He has eight TDs (five passing, three rushing) and no INTs with 96.3 QB rating in six career prime-time starts. ... RB Travis Etienne had a career-high 184 yards from scrimmage and two rushing TDs in the previous meeting against Buffalo. ... WR Brian Thomas ranks third among rookies with 141 yards receiving this season. ... TE Brenton Strange, filling in for Engram, had a career-high 65 yards receiving last week.

Bills QB Josh Allen has yet to throw an interception after totaling a career-worst 18 last season. He did lose a fumble in the season opener against Arizona, and has a record of 26-4 when not committing a turnover and 39-26 in games he does. ... Allen has topped 300 yards passing and with three or more touchdowns in four of seven appearances on Monday night. .... Buffalo’s 13 first downs against Miami was the team’s fewest since finishing with 12 in a 20-13 loss at Houston on Oct. 14, 2018, and fewest in a win since having 13 in beating the New York Jets 22-17 on Nov. 12, 2015. ... Buffalo has topped 100 yards rushing in 10 straight outings going back to last season, and is 13-2 when doing so since the start of 2023. ... RB James Cook matched a franchise record with three TDs in a half against Miami. ... Von Miller has a sack in each outing to increase his NFL active player-leading total to 125 1/2. He’s now tied with Dwight Freeney for 18th on the career list.
Allen and Cook have so far been the only consistent point-producers in a retooled Bills offense, which opened the season with an “everybody eats” mentality. Start both, while keeping Buffalo’s WRs and TEs on the bench in awaiting for a hierarchy to emerge.

CHICAGO (AP) — Taylor Hall said he woke up Thursday morning with a smile on his face.
For good reason.
Hall hit the ice with the Chicago Blackhawks for the first practice of training camp after he missed most of last season because of right knee surgery. It was an active offseason for Chicago in free agency, but Hall’s return might be the most important development for the rebuilding franchise.
“I’ve been through a long road of recovery and watched a lot of hockey and watched a lot of practices,” Hall said, “so for me to go out and play and join my teammates, there’s nothing more special for me. I feel like I have a better appreciation for what I do for a living now after being out for so long.”
Chicago acquired Hall and Nick Foligno in a June 2023 trade with Boston. The Blackhawks were about to select Connor Bedard with the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, and the pair of veteran forwards were brought in to provide more leadership and scoring alongside the young center.
But Hall never got going in his first season with the team.
First, he was sidelined by a left shoulder injury. In his third game after he came back, Hall hurt his right knee when he was hit by Tampa Bay’s Michael Eyssimont on Nov. 9. He tried to play through it, but ended up exacerbating the injury in practice, leading to his season-ending ACL surgery.
Hall, who turns 33 in November, totaled two goals and two assists in a career-low 10 games. All he could do is watch as Chicago struggled to score on its way to a 23-53-6 record and a last-place finish in the Central Division.


Hall said he is “100% healthy” as training camp ramps up this year.
“I don’t have any limitations in the gym or on the ice,” he said. “It’s more about just getting my brain up to game speed and playing hockey again.”
The only upside to the injuries for Hall was a chance to spend more time with his first child with his wife, Rachel — a son who was born in October.
“I was devastated to know that I was going to miss the whole season, obviously, but it did provide me some more family time,” Hall said, “some time with my son that I would never have had. It was a huge negative overall, but I tried to take some positives from it.”
If Hall can regain his previous form, he could provide a big lift for Chicago as it looks to become a more competitive team. He played alongside Bedard and Tyler Bertuzzi during a camp-opening scrimmage. He likely will play on a wing on one of the team’s top two lines this season.
Hall, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 draft, has 266 goals and 431 assists in 14 years in the NHL, also playing for Edmonton, New Jersey, Boston, Arizona and Buffalo. He has eight seasons with at least 50 points.
He set career highs with 39 goals and 54 assists for the Devils during the 2017-18 season, winning the Hart Trophy as NHL MVP.
“I’m excited. That’s my role,” Hall said of his scoring ability. “That’s what I’ve done for a long time in this league, and I know what I can bring to a team.”
Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson described Hall as “so revved up to play right now.”
“He’s all business right now, just the way we want to conduct ourselves as a team,” Richardson said, “and he’s driving that pace out there. That’s the way he likes to play. I remember him in New Jersey being an MVP of the league, and that’s the way he played.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Rev. Lee Scott publicly endorsed Kamala Harris for president during the Evangelicals for Harris Zoom call on Aug. 14, the Presbyterian pastor and farmer said he was taking a risk. 
“The easy thing for us to do this year would be to keep our heads down, go to the ballot box, keep our vote secret and go about our business,” Scott told the group, which garnered roughly 3,200 viewers according to organizers. “But at this time, I just can’t do that.”
Scott lives in Butler, Pennsylvania, the same town where a would-be assassin shot former President Donald Trump in July. Scott told The Associated Press that the attack and its impact on his community pushed him to speak out against Trump and the “vitriol” and “acceptable violence” he normalized in politics.
Trump has maintained strong support among white evangelical voters. According to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 white evangelical voters cast a ballot for him in 2020. But a small and diverse coalition of evangelicals is looking to pull their fellow believers away from the former president’s fold, offering not only an alternate candidate to support but an alternate vision for their faith altogether.
“I am tired of watching meanness, bigotry and recreational cruelty be the worldly witness of our faith,” Scott said on the call. “I want transformation, and transformation is risky business.”
Trump has heavily courted white conservative evangelicals since his arrival on the political scene almost a decade ago. Now he is selling Trump-themed Bibles, touting the overturning of Roe v. Wade and imploring Christians to get out the vote for him. 


But some evangelicals have used perceived cracks in his political fidelity to further distance themselves from the former president, especially as Trump and his surrogates have waffled over whether he would sign a federal abortion ban  should he become president.
The Rev. Dwight McKissic, a Baptist pastor from Texas who spoke on the Evangelicals for Harris call, said he saw no “moral superiority of one party over the other,” citing the GOP’s decision to “abandon a commitment to ban abortion with a constitutional amendment” and to soften its stance against same-sex marriage in its party platform.
Though he has historically voted Republican, McKissic said he would vote for Harris, whom he said has stronger character and qualifications. 
“I certainly don’t agree with her on all matters of policy,” said Scott, who identifies as evangelical and is ordained in the mainline Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). “I am pro-life. I am against abortion. But at the same time, she has a pro-family platform,” citing Harris’ education policies and promise to expand the child tax credit.
Grassroots groups like Evangelicals for Harris are hoping they can convince evangelicals who feel similarly to support Harris instead of voting for Trump or sitting out the election altogether.
With modest funding in 2020, the group, formerly known as Evangelicals for Biden, targeted evangelical voters in swing states. This election, the Rev. Jim Ball, the organization’s president, said they’re expanding the operation and looking to spend a million dollars on targeted advertisements.
While white evangelicals vote strongly Republican, not all evangelicals are a lock for the GOP, and in a tight race, every vote counts.
What to know about the 2024 Election
In 2020, Biden won about 2 in 10 white evangelical voters, but performed better with evangelicals overall, according to AP VoteCast, winning about one-third of this group. A September AP-NORC poll found that around 6 in 10 Americans who identify as “born-again” or “evangelical” have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Harris, but around one-third have a favorable opinion of her. The majority — around 8 in 10 — of white evangelicals have a negative view of Harris.
Vote Common Good, a similar group run by progressive evangelical pastor Doug Pagitt, has a simple message: Political identity and religious identity are not a package deal.
″There’s a whole group who have become very uncomfortable voting for Trump,” Pagitt said. “We’re not trying to get them to change their mind. We’re trying to work with them once their minds have changed to act on that change.”
In August, Harris’ campaign hired the Rev. Jen Butler, a Presbyterian (U.S.A.) minister and experienced faith-based organizer, to lead its religious outreach.
Butler told the AP she has been in touch with Evangelicals for Harris. With less than two months until Election Day, she wants to harness the power of grassroots groups to quickly engage even more faith voters. 
“We want to turn out our base, and we think we have some real potential here to reach folks who have voted Republican in the past,” Butler said. 
They are focusing on Black Protestants and Latino evangelicals, especially in key swing states. They are reaching out to Catholics and mainline Protestants across the Rust Belt and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Arizona and Nevada. Butler’s colleagues are working with Jewish and Muslim constituencies. 
Catholics for Harris and Interfaith for Harris groups are launching. Mainline Protestant groups like Black Church PAC and Christians for Kamala are also campaigning on behalf of the vice president.
Butler, who grew up evangelical in Georgia, said the Harris campaign can find common ground with evangelicals, particularly suburban evangelical women. 
“There’s a whole range of issues that they care about,” she said, citing compassionate approaches to immigration and abortion. “They know that the way to address any pro-life concerns is really to support women.” 
Even for evangelicals who dislike Trump, it can be difficult to support a Democrat. 
Russell Jeung, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and speaker on the Evangelicals for Harris call, told AP that the group doesn’t “agree with everything that Harris stands for” and that evangelicals can “hold the party accountable by being involved.”
Others on the call noted they would use their vote to pressure Harris on issues where they disagreed, with Latina evangelical activist Sandra Maria Van Opstal saying she’d push the potential Harris administration “to do better on Palestine-Israel and do better on immigration.”
Soong-Chan Rah, a professor of evangelism at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, describes himself as a nonpartisan progressive evangelical and a “prophet speaking to broken systems.” Though he’s never endorsed a candidate before, he said the stakes of this election are so high that he wanted to throw his public support behind Harris.
“Not only do I find this candidate, Trump, repugnant and repulsive,” Rah said, “it is to such an extreme that I want to endorse his opposition.”
But the chorus of evangelicals who find voting for a Democrat unconscionable remains loud.
Trump-supporting evangelical worship leader Sean Feucht ridiculed the existence of Evangelicals for Harris on X: “HERETICS FOR HARRIS rings so much truer!”
The Rev. Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump supporter, took issue with one of the group’s ads and its use of footage of his late father, the Rev. Billy Graham. “The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris,” he wrote on his public Facebook page, which has 10 million followers.
But the project of shoring up Democratic evangelical voters goes beyond partisan politics. It gets at the core of what evangelicalism means.
The term evangelical itself is fraught and has become synonymous with the Republican Party, argues Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University.
“More people are probably evangelical theologically,” said Burge, “but they’re not going to grab that word because they don’t vote for Trump or they’re moderate or liberal.”
Evangelicalism has historically referenced Christians who hold conservative theological beliefs regarding issues like the importance of the Bible and being born again. But that’s changed as the term has grown more connected with Republican voters.
For many, evangelicalism has largely been defined along racial and socio-political lines and in endorsing Harris, Rah hopes to “show that there are other voices in the church aside from the religious right and Trump evangelicals.”
Latasha Morrison, a speaker on the Evangelicals for Harris Zoom, told the AP that as a Black woman, “I never associated myself with the word ‘evangelical’ until I started attending predominantly white churches.”
For years her anti-abortion views led her to vote Republican, but now the Christian author and diversity trainer says, “I feel like women and children have a better opportunity under the Harris administration than the Trump administration.”
For Ball, the Evangelicals for Harris organizer, he’s not looking to “tell people if they are an evangelical” or not.
“Diversity is a strength for us. We’re not looking for total unanimity. We’re looking for unity,” Ball said. “We can be united while we still have differences.”

HOUSTON (AP) — The Jacksonville Jaguars were up by three late in the third quarter Sunday with a chance to pad the lead after a 58-yard run by Tank Bigsby gave them a first down at the Houston 4.
But instead of a score, the Jaguars came up with a goose egg and the Texans rallied for a 24-20 victory to leave Jacksonville (0-4) winless.
After Bigsby’s run put them in scoring position, he had carries on the next two plays that got them to the 2. Trevor Lawrence then threw an incomplete pass intended for Gabe Davis to bring up fourth down.
Jacksonville went for it, but Lawrence was stuffed for no gain on the first play of the fourth quarter.
“Coach puts it in our hands, so we got to figure it out and make the play,” Lawrence said. “We had the opportunity. I felt like we had some good looks down there to do more with it and we weren’t able to capitalize.”
Coach Doug Pederson declined to discuss the play. 
“It’s a moot point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter now, so I’m not going to talk about it.”
Lawrence threw for 169 yards and two touchdowns as his streak of consecutive starts without a win stretched to nine games.
The Jaguars fell to 0-4 for the first time since opening the 2021 season with five straight losses. Tennessee is the NFL’s only other winless team, bringing an 0-3 record into a Monday night matchup against Miami. 
“No one likes to work all week to lose,” running back Travis Etienne said. “It’s kind of that same feeling, it’s kind of getting repetitive. No one likes that. Everyone’s frustrated but man, talking about it won’t help us. We just have to keep working... we just have to finish.” 


Pederson seemed caught off-guard when he was asked if he’s worried about his job status after the dismal start.

“My status? I mean, no,” he said. “That’s kind of a strange question, but OK.”
Though the goal line gaffe was their biggest missed opportunity Sunday, the Jaguars had other chances to close this one out after getting blown out by the Bills on Monday.
Lawrence brought up the team’s missed chances nine different times in his postgame comments. 
“We had a lot of opportunities, run game and throwing the ball down the field,” he said. “Didn’t capitalize on all of them, unfortunately, and that’s kind of why we’re here now and didn’t win the game in my opinion, because we didn’t take advantage of some of those opportunities.” 
Christian Kirk put the Jaguars up 20-17 with an 8-yard TD grab with about six minutes left in the third quarter. Brian Thomas powered that drive with a 32-yard reception and a 13-yard run.
After stopping the Texans to get the ball back, Derek Stingley knocked down Lawrence’s pass to force a punt with about six minutes left.
Jacksonville’s defense stopped Houston again after that, but the Jaguars managed just three plays before punting and ate less than a minute of the clock to give the Texans one last chance.
C.J. Stroud then put together a nine-play, 69-yard drive, capped by a 1-yard pass to Dare Ogunbowale with 18 seconds left, to give Houston the win.
Etienne said the Jaguars must look forward instead of worrying about what’s already happened.
“How can we be better next week? That’s the question I feel like we should be asking ourselves,” he said. “How can we be our best selves? How can we go 1-0 next week? Dwelling on how we got 0-4 or losing those games is not going to get us over the hump to win one game.”

Publication date:2024-09-28 01:26:00

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — After a day filled with hopes of a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, the U.N. General Assembly meeting Friday was a harsh reality check. 
Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU shut down the idea in a morning speech that he said he didn’t initially intend to make. He said he had not planned to come to the meeting this year, because his country is at war, but “after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight.”
The week has been full of speakers calling for a cease-fire in both Lebanon and Gaza, continuing into Friday. But Netanyahu wasn’t swayed. He said his nation will “continue degrading Hezbollah” until achieving its goals along the Lebanon border, and would no longer tolerate daily rocket fire from the area. Shortly after Netanyahu wrapped up his speech, the Israeli military said it carried out a strike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut, which caused huge blasts in the city. 
Here’s your daily guide to what’s going on at the United Nations this week:
MORE ANTI-WAR: Calls for Israel to stop its war in Gaza and back off from a growing conflict in Lebanon continued. The two speakers who preceded Netanyahu each made a point of calling out Israel for its actions. “Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,” Slovenian Prime Minister ROBERT GOLOB said as he closed his remarks, pounding the podium. And Pakistani Prime Minister SHEHBAZ SHARIF, speaking just before the Israeli leader, declared of Gaza: “This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.” He thumped the rostrum to audible applause.
PROMISE FOR DEMOCRACY: Tanzania Prime Minister KASSIM MAJALIWA pledged that his country will uphold democracy and human rights ahead of next year’s presidential election. An opposition party official was killed in early September and two main opposition leaders were arrested among a dozen other opposition politicians while planning a youth rally and during protests against recent killing and arrest of opposition officials and members. President SAMIA SULUHU has condemned the killing of the opposition official Ali Kibao and promised justice. She’s serving out the term of the late President JOHN MAGUFULI, whose autocratic rule saw the ban on political rallies and detention of opposition leaders.


POETRY IN POLICY: As Pakistan tries to climb out of an economic crisis, Sharif turned Friday to poetry to convey his country’s resolve. Addressing world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, he read aloud part of “Keep Going,” a 1921 piece by American poet Edgar A. Guest. It begins “When things go wrong, as they sometimes will” — when, for example, “the funds are low and the debts are high.” (Sharif substituted “credits” for “funds.”) Pakistan’s debts are indeed substantial. The International Monetary Fund this week approved a $7 billion loan for the nation, which plunged into one of the worst economic crises in its history after flooding in 2022. Sharif’s government raised electricity prices, saying the hike was necessary to meet conditions of the new loan. The increase spurred protests and a merchants’ strike. Sharif told the assembly that his government has “taken some very difficult but necessary decisions that have rescued our economy from collapse.” Then he brought up the poem, saying it had bucked him up. He went through a stanza that ends: “When care is pressing you down a bit, / Rest if you must, but don’t you quit.” “This,” Sharif told the assembly, “is how we have learned to face our challenges and negotiate the most daunting challenges that we have faced.”
CUBA COMMENTS: For decades Cuba’s primary foreign-policy priority has been ending the U.S. trade embargo on the island. The country dedicates much of its General Assembly diplomacy to getting leaders to decry the embargo. According to Cuba’s U.N. mission, by 3:41 p.m. on Friday 25 countries had addressed the embargo at this year’s UNGA and 11 leaders had critiqued the U.S. inclusion of Cuba on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism, another sanction limiting international trade. Many of the countries that spoke have benefitted from another of Cuba’s trademark programs, sending its well-trained and highly educated doctors to developing countries across the world. Right after mentioning Ukraine and Gaza, Prime Minister ALLAH MAYE HALINA of Chad told the world that “we can’t ignore the embargo on Cuba, which hurts its people and hinders its development.”
Norwegian Foreign Minister ESPEN BARTH EIDE, who was in the General Assembly hall listening to Netanyahu, called his address “a rather dark speech” that was “very defiant.” Norway recognized the State of Palestine in May. Eide said there are many countries that would like to support Israel and normalize relations, including Saudi Arabia and others in region, “but they are not able to do that as long as the Palestinian question remains unanswered.”
FUNDRAISERS, ADVOCATES: As the meeting of world leaders unfolds at the United Nations, a crush of events take place on the sidelines of the official high-level meetings, where nonprofits, advocates and fundraisers mingle and lobby world leaders, billionaires and funders — and plan their next steps with each other. A few examples: On Sunday, throngs of people streamed through a “climate science fair ” showcasing work on nature, food and the energy transition, held across Manhattan on an elevated park that runs along old rail lines. On Monday, the BILL & MELINDA GATES Foundation held a ceremony featuring Grammy-winning musician JON BATISTE performing in a gold sequin suit, and honoring Brazilian PRESIDENT LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DA SILVA for his work lifting millions out of poverty and significantly reducing malnutrition among children.
Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, JAMES MARAPE, told the General Assembly that accessing money to fight climate change has been a challenge. “It is for this reason I speak in solidarity with all forest nations, especially those in the Congo Basin and Amazon Basin, for adequate compensation if we are to preserve our forests which, in fact, are the lungs of Earth,” Marape said.
“It is regrettable that the Republic of China, Taiwan, continues to be excluded from the United Nations system.”
—FELETI PENITALA TEO, prime minister of Tuvalu
Ugandan Prime Minister NABBANJA ROBINAH asked the assembly why the U.N. has failed to forge stronger international cooperation in response to collective global challenges. “Urgent action is required to address global inequalities with regard to poverty, hunger and disease which continue to affect disproportionally the poorest and most vulnerable,” she said. 
If you’re following along and confused by all the strange words, take a look at our brief vocabulary of U.N. terms.

Russia’s top diplomat warned Saturday against “trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power,” delivering a U.N. General Assembly speech packed with condemnations of what Russia sees as Western attempts at global domination and machinations in Ukraine -- and even inside the United Nations itself.
Three days after Russian President Vladimir Putin aired a shift in his country’s nuclear doctrine, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of using Ukraine — which Russia invaded in February 2022 — as a tool to try “to defeat” Moscow strategically, and “preparing Europe for it to also throw itself into this suicidal escapade.”
“I’m not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,” he said. 
Putin’s recent announcement — which appeared to lower significantly the threshold for the possible use of Russia’s nuclear arsenal — was seen as a message to the U.S. and other Western countries as Ukraine seeks their go-ahead to strike Russia with longer-range weapons. 
“Whether or not they will provide the permission for Ukraine for long-range weapons, then we will see what their understanding was of what they heard,” Lavrov said at a news conference after his speech Saturday.
The Biden administration this week announced an additional $2.7 billion in military aid for Ukraine, but it doesn’t include the type of long-range arms that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking, nor a green light to use such weapons to strike deep into Russia. 


In the wide-ranging news conference, Lavrov complained that the “arrogance and aggressiveness of Western politicians” toward Russia was hobbling global governance, from the U.N. Security Council to the newly adopted Pact for the Future, which Russia sought unsuccessfully to water down.
He was critical of the geopolitical and military expansion of NATO, saying, “It is now trying to take root in the south Caucusus, in central Asia, creating direct threats to the security of our country.”
NATO has partnerships with the three south Caucusus countries – Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan — and all central Asian countries except Afghanistan. But none is a NATO member. “And now the same is happening in the Asia-Pacific region, where NATO infrastructure is creeping in to contain or deter China and Russia,” he told the assembly.
Lavrov accused the United States of seeking “to preserve their hegemony and to govern everything.” He pointed to NATO’s deepening relations with four partners – New Zealand, Australia, South Korea and Japan — as well as the so-called Quad which groups the U.S., India, Australia and Japan.
On nuclear issues, when Russia suspended the New START nuclear treaty with the United States in February 2023, it said Moscow would abide by its limits – a maximum 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. Lavrov told reporters Russia will comply with the levels until the expiration of the treaty in 2026.
The specter of nuclear threats and confrontation has hung over the war in Ukraine since its start. Shortly before the invasion, Putin reminded the world that his country was “ one of the most powerful nuclear states,” and he put its nuclear forces on high alert shortly after. His nuclear rhetoric has ramped up and toned down at various points since.
On Wednesday, Putin said that if attacked by any country supported by a nuclear-armed nation, Russia will consider that a joint attack. He didn’t specify whether that would bring a nuclear response, but he stressed that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional assault that posed a “critical threat to our sovereignty.” 
The United States and the European Union called his statements “irresponsible.” There was no immediate response to Lavrov’s address Saturday from the U.S., which had a junior diplomat taking notes in its assembly seat as he spoke. 
More than 2½ years into the fighting, Russia is making slow but continuing gains in Ukraine’s east. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russian territory with missiles and drones and embarrassed Moscow with a surprise incursion by its troops last month that made significant gains in a border region.
Zelenskyy has pushed what he calls a peace formula to end the war. Provisions include expelling all Russian forces from Ukraine, ensuring accountability for war crimes, freeing prisoners of war and deportees, and more. 
Meanwhile, Brazil and China have been floating a peace plan that entails holding a peace conference with both Ukraine and Russia and not expanding the battlefield or otherwise escalating fighting. Chinese and Brazilian diplomats have been promoting the plan during the assembly and attracted a dozen other nations, mostly in Africa or Latin America, to join a group of “friends for peace” in Ukraine.
Lavrov said at his news conference that Russia was ready to provide assistance and advice to the group, adding that “it’s important for their proposals to be underpinned by the realities and not just be taken from some abstract conversations.”

                Question: Who became the first Japanese actor to win an Emmy on September 15, 2024?

Publication date:2024-09-15 07:00:00

LOS ANGELES (AP) — “Shogun” had historic wins in an epic 18-Emmy first season, “Hacks” scored an upset for best comedy on what was still a four-trophy night for “The Bear,” and “Baby Reindeer” had a holiday at an Emmy Awards that had some surprising swerves.

“Shogun,” the FX series about power struggles in feudal Japan, won best drama series, Hiroyuki Sanada won best actor in a drama, and Anna Sawai won best actress. Sanada was the first Japanese actor to win an Emmy. Sawai became the second just moments later. 

”‘Shogun’ taught me when we work together, we can make miracles,” Sanada said in his acceptance speech from the stage of the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. 

Along with 14 Emmys it claimed at the precursor Creative Arts Emmys, it had an unmatched performance with 18 overall for one season. 

“Hacks” was the surprise winner of its first best comedy series award, topping “The Bear,” which most had expected to take it after big wins earlier in the evening. 

Jean Smart won her third best actress in a comedy award for the third season of Max’s “Hacks,” in which her stand-up comic character Deborah Vance tries to make it in late-night TV. Smart has six Emmys overall.

Despite losing out on the night’s biggest comedy prize after winning it for its first season at January’s strike-delayed ceremony, FX’s “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White won best actor in a comedy for the second straight year, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach repeated as best supporting actor.



And Liza Colón-Zayas was the surprise best supporting actor winner over competition that included Meryl Streep, becoming the first Latina to win in the category.

“To all the Latinas who are looking at me,” she said, her eyes welling with tears. “keep believing, and vote.”

Netflix’s darkly quirky “Baby Reindeer” won best limited series. Creator and star Richard Gadd won for his lead acting and his writing and Jessica Gunning, who plays his tormentor, won best supporting actress. 

Accepting the series award, Gadd urged the makers of television to take chances. 

“The only constant across any success in television is good storytelling,” he said. “Good storytelling that speaks to our times. So take risks, push boundaries. Explore the uncomfortable. Dare to fail in order to achieve.”

“Baby Reindeer” is based on a one man-stage show in which Gadd describes being sexually abused along with other emotional struggles.

Accepting that award, he said, “no matter how bad it gets, it always gets better.”

The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Gadd has.

Jodie Foster won her first Emmy to go with her two Oscars when she took best actress in a limited series for “True Detective: Night Country.”

Foster played a salty police chief investigating a mass killing in the round-the-clock dark of an Alaskan winter on the HBO show. While her castmate Kali Reis missed out on becoming the first Indigenous actor to win an Emmy in the supporting category, Foster praised her, and the show’s collaboration with Indigenous contributors. 

“The Inupiaq and Inuit people of northern Alaska who told us their stories, and they allowed us to listen,” Foster said. “That was just a blessing. It was love, love, love, and when you feel that, something amazing happens.” 

Greg Berlanti, a producer and writer on shows including “Dawson’s Creek” and “Everwood,” received the Television Academy’s Governors Award for his career-long contributions to improving LGBTQ visibility on television. He talked about a childhood when there was little such visibility. 

“There wasn’t a lot of gay characters on television back then, and I was a closeted gay kid,” Berlanti said. “It’s hard to describe how lonely that was at the time,”

The long decline of traditional broadcast TV at the Emmys continued, with zero wins between the four broadcast networks. 

In the monologue that opened the ABC telecast, Dan Levy, who hosted with his father and “Schitt’s Creek” co-star Eugene Levy, called the Emmys “broadcast TV’s biggest night for honoring movie stars on streaming services.” 

Though other than Foster, movie stars didn’t fare too well. Her fellow Oscar winners Streep and Robert Downey Jr. had been among the favorites, but came up empty. 

“Robert Downey Jr. I have a poster of you in my house!” said Lamorne Morris, who beat Downey for best supporting actor in a limited series, said from the stage as he accepted his first Emmy.

The evening managed to meet many expectations but included several swerves like the win for “Hacks.” 

“We were really shocked,” “Hacks co-creator Jen Statsky, who also won for writing, said after the show. ”We were truly, really surprised.”

And “Shogun” got off to a quiet start, missing on early awards and not getting its first trophy until past the halfway point.

Still, it shattered the record for Emmys for one season previously held by the 2008 limited series “John Adams” in 2008. And its acting wins would have been hard to imagine before the series became an acclaimed phenomenon.

Sanada is a 63-year-old longtime screen star whose name is little known outside Japan, even if his face is through Hollywood films like “The Last Samurai” and “John Wick Chapter 4.” Sawai, 32, who was born in New Zealand and moved to Japan as a child, is significantly less known in the U.S. She wept when she accepted best actress. 

“When you saw me cry on stage, it was probably the 12th time I cried today,” Sawai said backstage. “It was just mixed emotions, wanting everyone to win all that. I may cry again now.”

“The Bear” would finish second with 11 overall Emmys, including guest acting wins at the Creative Arts ceremony for Jamie Lee Curtis and Jon Bernthal.

The Levys in their opening monologue mocked the show being in the comedy category.

“In honor of ‘The Bear’ we will be making no jokes,” Eugene Levy said, to laughs.

Elizabeth Debicki took best supporting actress in a drama for playing Princess Diana at the end of her life in the sixth and final season of “The Crown.” 

“Playing this part, based on this unparalleled, incredible human being, has been my great privilege,” Debicki said in her acceptance. “It’s been a gift.” 

Several awards were presented by themed teams from TV history, including sitcom dads George Lopez, Damon Wayans and Jesse Tyler Ferguson and TV moms Meredith Baxter, Connie Britton, and Susan Kelechi Watson.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper and his wife Nicole have made an initial $3 million commitment to Hurricane Helene relief efforts through their foundation. 
It’s to support immediate and long-term humanitarian aid and recovery efforts in North and South Carolina in the wake of devastation from the Category 4 storm.
The region remains in a state of emergency, and more than 50 people have died.
“The David & Nicole Tepper Foundation, Carolina Panthers, and Charlotte FC stand alongside all those who have been affected by Hurricane Helene and the devastation it has wrought across the southeast, and particularly in our backyard throughout the Carolinas,” said David and Nicole Tepper said in a release.
Tepper purchased the Panthers in 2018. The foundation will assist a number of food banks and pantries, local community foundations and other service agencies in the Carolinas.
“This is our home and we are committed to supporting relief efforts throughout the region by providing critical resources and aiding the efforts of our heroic first responders,” the Teppers said. “The impact on our community has been severe, but Carolinians are resilient and courageous, and together, we will rebuild and recover.”

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Difficult as it was for Damar Hamlin to deal with his many trepidations in last year’s successful bid to resume playing football following a near-death experience, the Buffalo Bills safety wouldn’t change a thing in retrospect.
Each step of the process — his first practice, first tackle, first game — is what Hamlin believes led to him achieving a new plateau in his comeback in being selected a season-opening starter on Wednesday. 
Coach Sean McDermott made it official by announcing Hamlin will be paired with Taylor Rapp when the Bills take the field in hosting the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.

“I reflect back on the whole process and me not knowing if I would even be able to play again,” he added. “Last season was primarily just about healing and making myself do the hard stuff, thrusting myself into things that were uncomfortable, that made me fearful or gave me anxiety. But I was doing the hard stuff last year to make it easier this year.”
Whether by design or chance, Hamlin sat at the interview table wearing a green pullover with the words “Don’t Quit” printed on the front.
“It aligns with who I am,” he said.
In a mere 20 months, Hamlin has gone from going into cardiac arrest and needing to be resuscitated on the field during a prime-time game at Cincinnati, to the fourth-year player earning a starting spot in a completely retooled secondary.


Both spots were open following the offseason breakup of Buffalo’s seven-year starting tandem, with Jordan Poyer released and Micah Hyde still unsigned and contemplating retirement.
Hamlin, however, was hardly assured being a starter after Buffalo signed fifth-year player Mike Edwards in free agency and then used a second-round pick to draft Cole Bishop. Edwards and Bishop, however, have missed significant time because of injuries, and McDermott credited Hamlin for showing consistency and building an on-field rapport with Rapp.

“What else can’t this young man do?” McDermott said, proudly, referring to Hamlin, a sixth-round pick out of Pittsburgh.
“It’s one thing to come back off of an ACL or a broken bone. It’s another thing to come back off of what he came back off of, right, let alone just decide to play contact football. ... I mean, it’s incredible,” he added. “We’re just extremely proud and full of gratitude to watch him go through what he’s went through and where he is now.”
It wasn’t easy, Hamlin said, but worth it in acknowledging he often reflects back on what happened.
“I think about it all the time. As much as the world experienced it, it happened to me,” Hamlin said. “I enjoy that part of it because it allows me to stay connected with the reason why I’m here ... and I have a second chance at doing things the right way in all areas of my life.”
Hamlin spent two days in a medically induced coma before finally being awakened while surrounded by his family. Doctors diagnosed the cause of Hamlin’s heart stopping as a result of commotio cordis, which happens when a direct blow at a specific point in a heartbeat causes cardiac arrest. Cleared for practice and assured by specialists the chances of a recurrence being slim, Hamlin was gradually eased back into football.
He was limited to appearing in just five games in a backup and special teams role last season. In 2022, Hamlin enjoyed his most playing time in starting 13 games in place of Hyde, who was sidelined by a neck injury.
“I was super excited,” Hamlin said, of being informed he won a starting job.
“Not going to lie, man, it’s like a dream come true to work so hard then get what you worked for,” he added. “But I want to continue on. You know, it’s not about just performing in one game.”
NOTES: The Bills are going with two captains — quarterback Josh Allen and middle linebacker Terrell Bernard — after losing six of eight captains from last year this offseason. The team will also feature a 10-player leadership council. ... WR Curtis Samuel is expected to play and practiced fully after being bothered by a toe injury. Backup QB Mitch Trubisky was limited in practice with a knee injury sustained last month.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Sao Paulo state’s government said it will deploy hundreds of police officers and provide escorts for team buses for Friday’s NFL game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers after some players expressed concern about playing in Brazil. 
Security operations for the game in Sao Paulo’s NeoQuimica Arena will be coordinated with U.S. authorities, the state’s public security secretariat said in a statement Wednesday. Gun violence and crime rates in Brazil are among the highest in the Latin America. Metropolitan Sao Paulo has also faced a wave of cellphone thefts.
Hundreds of civilian and military police will be deployed for the game, the first NFL match to be played in the South American country, according to the statement. Military police will be used to escort the teams’ buses to their hotels, training grounds and to the stadium. 
“Our policing will be beefed up during the week to secure the public’s safety for this historic match, with officers on the streets and avenues around the stadium, in public transportation, in the hotels and in tourist areas of the city,” the security secretariat said. 
Earlier this week, Eagles cornerback Darius Slay said in a podcast he did not want to go to Brazil because of the country’s crime rate. AJ Brown, a wide receiver of the same team, told said he will probably stay in his hotel room throughout his time in Sao Paulo. Other players expressed similar concerns.


On Saturday, San Francisco 49ers rookie receiver Ricky Pearsall was shot in the chest during an attempted robbery in central San Francisco. 
Sao Paulo state’s government said it will also send trained dogs to the stadium before the match to detect potential explosive devices that could put fans or players in danger. Helicopters and drones will also be used.
Sao Paulo police will have a station inside the stadium to support women who are victims of violence.

GENEVA (AP) — The World Health Organization said Friday it has granted its first authorization for use of a vaccine against mpox in adults, calling it an important step toward fighting the disease in Africa.
The approval of the vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic A/S means that donors like vaccines alliance Gavi and UNICEF can buy it. But supplies are limited because there’s only a single manufacturer. 
“This first (authorization) of a vaccine against mpox is an important step in our fight against the disease, both in the context of the current outbreaks in Africa, and in future,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 
WHO also said it was creating an “access and allocation mechanism” to try to fairly distribute mpox tests, treatments and vaccines to the countries who need them most.
The U.N. health agency approved the two-dose mpox vaccine for people aged 18 and above. WHO said that while it was not recommending the vaccine for those under 18, the shot may be used in infants, children and adolescents “in outbreak settings where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks.”
WHO recommended that a single dose of the shot could be used to stretch supplies, but emphasized the need to collect more data on how effective the vaccine might be as a single shot.
The mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic was previously authorized by numerous rich countries across Europe and North America during the global mpox outbreak in 2022. Millions of doses given to adults showed the vaccine helped slow the virus’ spread, but there is limited evidence of how it works in children.


Officials at the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that nearly 70% of cases in Congo — the country hardest hit by mpox — are in children younger than 15, who also accounted for 85% of deaths.
Overall, WHO said over 120 countries have confirmed more than 103,000 cases of mpox since the outbreak began two years ago. Its latest tally, as of Sunday, showed that 723 people in more than a dozen countries in Africa have died of the disease.
African experts have estimated they might need about 10 million vaccines to stop the ongoing outbreaks on the continent while donor countries have promised to provide about 3.6 million vaccines. As of last week, Congo had received only about 250,000 doses.
On Thursday, the Africa CDC said 107 new deaths and 3,160 new cases had been recorded in the past week, just a week after it and WHO launched a continent-wide response plan.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Tennessee Volunteers made a big statement on Saturday night.
Quarterback Nico Iamaleava combined for 276 yards and three touchdowns, former walk-on safety Will Brooks’ 85-yard interception return for a score highlighted a dominant defensive performance and the 14th-ranked Vols trounced No. 24 North Carolina State 51-10 in the Duke’s Mayo Classic.
Iamaleava completed 16 of 23 passes for 211 yards and threw TDs to Miles Kitselman and Holden Staes. He also ran for 65 yards, including a 31-yard score, as the Vols scored on eight of their 11 possessions with the redshirt freshman under center.
“He played within himself and responded well to adversity and that is one of the things we haven’t seen from him,” Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said of Iamaleava overcoming two interceptions. “I am really proud of his demeanor.”
Despite the two mistakes, Iamaleava passed the first major test of his starting career with flying colors. The Vols have now scored 120 points in their first two games following a 69-3 win over Chattanooga in the opener.
“It was a little sloppy in the beginning but I thought we finished strong in the second half,” Iamaleava said. 
Dylan Sampson ran for 132 yards and two touchdowns as Tennessee (2-0) outgained NC State 460 yards to 143.
Tennessee limited NC State quarterback Grayson McCall to 104 yards passing and forced three turnovers. The Vols held the Wolfpack to 39 yards rushing on 28 carries and NC State’s only touchdown came on a pick-six.


Heupel called it an “elite” defensive performance.
“The standard at Tennessee is to be elite on defense. This is the home of Reggie White, Al Wilson and Eric Berry,” Heupel said.
The offense wasn’t too bad either.
Iamaleava didn’t take long to show off his skillset, breaking containment and outracing two defenders to pick up 12 yards on a third-and-7 play to keep the Vols’ opening drive alive. Tennessee would break through on its second drive with a series of short completions by Iamaleava before Sampson raced nine yards up the middle for a touchdown.
After the teams traded field goals, NC State (1-1) drove deep into Tennessee territory before McCall overthrew tight end Justin Joly in the flat and Brooks grabbed the first interception of his career and raced untouched down the left sideline for the touchdown and a 17-3 lead. It was the 10th-longest INT return for a touchdown in school history and the longest since Daniel Bituli’s 97-yarder against Alabama in 2017.
“That was part of the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Heupel said.
Max Gilbert tacked on a 45-yard field goal at the end of the first half to give the Vols a 17-point lead at the break. 
Things quickly went from bad to worse for NC State in the second half.
On Tennessee’s opening possession of the third quarter, Iamaleava moved the chains with a fourth-down run and then found a wide-open Kitselman down the left sideline for a touchdown.
Dominic Bailey followed with a strip of McCall and recovered at the NC State 22-yard line leading to Gilbert’s third field of the game and the rout was on.
And when NC State was stuffed on a desperation fourth-and-1 run in its own territory, Iamaleava put the game away with a burst up the middle on a QB draw with 4:07 left in the third quarter.
“It got away from us. It snowballed as it went,” NC State coach Dave Doeren said. “We have a lot of work to do to get back to it.”
Doeren said he plans to stick with McCall at quarterback.
“He’s mad at himself, but he has to get back and flush it,” Doeren said. “We have great confidence in Grayson. As a head coach I completely believe in him.”
Offensively the Vols used a lot of two tight end personnel, something that took the Wolfpack by surprise.
“This is deepest our tight end room has been and it will be a part of what we continue to do,” Heupel said. 
Tennessee: The Vols’ up-tempo offense was clicking on all cylinders after the game’s first drive and their defense was outstanding. This has the look of a team that has the potential to compete for a national championship.
NC State: The Wolfpack offense looked completely out of sync as it managed just 27 yards in the second half and turned it over three times. Unlike last week against FCS school Western Carolina, NC State wasn’t able to mount a fourth-quarter rally.
With a strong showing against a Top 25 team, the Vols are likely to move up in the rankings possibly into the Top 10. The Wolfpack can say goodbye to their Top 25 ranking after a lackluster performance last week against Western Carolina and this debacle.
Tennessee: Will be a big favorite on Saturday when it hosts Kent State.
NC State: Returns home to play Louisiana Tech on Saturday.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Kody Clemens singled with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth after Tampa Bay had tied the score in the top of the inning, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Rays 2-1 on Monday night. 
Kyle Schwarber homered and Cristopher Sánchez pitched six shutout innings to help NL East-leading Philadelphia begin a six-game homestand with its 48th home victory of the season. The Phillies entered tied with the Dodgers for the most home wins in baseball. 
“That’s a backyard dream,” Clemens said. “For that moment to come up and get the job done, it’s obviously pretty cool.”
Brandon Lowe hit the tying homer for the Rays, who began play five games out of a wild-card spot in the American League. 
Manuel Rodríguez got the first out in the bottom of the ninth before being relieved by Garrett Cleavinger (3-5), who loaded the bases with two outs on a pair of singles and a walk. Clemens lined a 1-0, 95-mph sinker into right field to draw loud “KO-DY! KO-DY!” cheers from the crowd of 39,511.
“He can hit,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said.
Clemens’ heroics was preceded by a walk to load the bases by minor-league call-up Buddy Kennedy, a native of nearby Millville and the grandson of former Phillies infielder Don Money. Fans loudly chanted “BUD-DY! ”BUD-DY!” during the at-bat.
“It was something very special, and I’ll always remember that for the rest of my life,” Kennedy said.


Kennedy got several texts after the game and expects to trade messages with star slugger Mike Trout, a fellow Millville native.
“I was getting chills,” Clemens said of hearing the chants while in the on-deck circle.
Carlos Estévez (4-4) blew his fifth save and second in six chances with the Phillies since being acquired prior to the July trade deadline in the top of the inning. Lowe led off the ninth with a pinch-hit drive to deep center. Johan Rojas appeared to make a stellar, leaping catch against the wall in left-center in the deepest part of the park, but the ball popped out of Rojas’ glove and over the fence for a home run after his glove hit the top of the outfield wall. 
“My heart kind of dropped a little,” Lowe said. “Thankfully for me, the ball came out of his glove. It was a heck of an effort.”
Said Thomson, “That would’ve been an unbelievable catch, highlight-reel stuff. He did nothing wrong.”
The Phillies finished with five hits but didn’t get their first until Schwarber’s shot with one out in the sixth. 
After Rays opener Cole Sulser pitched a scoreless first, Tyler Alexander retired his first 13 batters before Schwarber’s drive that traveled an estimated 447 feet. It was the sixth homer in seven games for Schwarber. 
Sánchez struck out four and gave up four hits in six innings. Orion Kerkering tossed a 1-2-3 seventh, and Jeff Hoffman worked out of a jam in the eighth.
The Rays were vying for the fifth no-hitter in the majors this season and the second in franchise history, following Matt Garza’s no-hitter against Detroit on July 26, 2010. Philadelphia has been no-hit 22 times, which is the most in baseball.
Tampa Bay threatened in the eighth against Hoffman, putting runners on first and third with two outs on singles by Yandy Díaz and Jonny DeLuca. But Hoffman struck out Junior Caminero for the final out to keep the Rays off the board. 
Thomson said two-time NL MVP Bryce Harper apologized to him after staring down a ball in the ninth inning that went off the wall. Harper ended up only at first base after not running out of the box. 
“He’s accountable and admits to his mistakes,” Thomson said.
Phillies: C JT Realmuto (left knee contusion) was out of the lineup for the third straight game. ... Estévez sustained a left knee contusion after getting drilled by a Josh Lowe liner that went for an infield single with two outs in the ninth. 
Rays: Brandon Lowe hit after sitting out the weekend’s games in Baltimore due to right middle finger inflammation.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The mayor of a central Wisconsin city who ran for office on his opposition to absentee ballot drop boxes said Wednesday he did nothing wrong when he put on work gloves, donned a hard hat and used a dolly to cart away a drop box outside City Hall.
Wausau Mayor Doug Diny posed for a picture Sunday to memorialize his removal of the city’s lone drop box that had been put outside City Hall around the same time late last week that absentee ballots were sent to voters. The city’s election clerk, Kaitlyn Bernarde, said she has reported the issue to the Marathon County district attorney a well as the state elections commission.
“This is no different than the maintenance guy moving it out there,” Diny said Wednesday. “I’m a member of staff. There’s nothing nefarious going on here. I’m hoping for a good result.”
The move, which sparked a protest in the city Tuesday night and anger among drop box advocates, is the latest example in swing state Wisconsin of the fight over whether communities will allow absentee ballot drop boxes.
More than 60 towns, villages and cities in nine counties have opted out of using absentee ballot drop boxes for the presidential election in November, according to a tally by the group All Voting is Local. Drop boxes are being embraced in heavily Democratic cities including Milwaukee and Madison. Wisconsin has a total of 72 counties. 
Drop boxes were widely used in 2020, fueled by a dramatic increase in absentee voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 500 drop boxes were set up in more than 430 communities for the election that year, including more than a dozen each in Madison and Milwaukee. Drop boxes were used in 39 other states during the 2022 election, according to the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project.


After former President Donald Trump lost the state in 2020, he and Republicans alleged that drop boxes facilitated cheating, even though they offered no evidence. Democrats, election officials and some Republicans argued the boxes are secure.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court, then controlled by conservatives, banned the use of drop boxes in 2022.
But in July, the now-liberal controlled court reversed that decision and said drop boxes could be used. However, the court left it up to each community to decide whether to install them.
The Wisconsin Elections Commission, in guidance sent in July to all 1,800-plus clerks who administer elections in Wisconsin, said it was up to municipal clerks to determine the location of drop boxes.
Wausau, with about 40,000 people, was among the cities that did not use an absentee drop box in the August state primary. Wausau is located in Marathon County, which Trump won by 18 points in both 2016 and 2020.
Diny ran as a conservative and was backed by the Republican Party in the nonpartisan mayor’s race. He is in his first year as Wausau mayor after being elected in April.
Diny said that he and the city clerk never discussed the drop box before it was placed outside City Hall late last week. Diny said he decided Sunday to act when he realized the drop box was “not secure.”
Bernarde said Wednesday that the city planned to “secure the drop box to the ground” and unlock it, but it was removed before that could be done. The box was locked and contained no ballots, she said. Not a single absentee ballot had been returned to the city of Wausau as of Monday, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.
What to know about the 2024 Election
Diny said he wanted the city council to have a say in what happens with the drop box. Had the city council voted to put the drop box out, Diny said he wouldn’t have had the authority to remove it.
While Diny said he is generally opposed to drop boxes, he also said he’s not taking a position on whether it should be in place for the ballots that are in voters’ hands now and can be returned until Election Day.
“As it stands now, I don’t have a dog in the hunt,” Diny said. “I want it to be done properly and with the proper input and consent of citizens.”
It is a felony in Wisconsin to impede or prevent “the free exercise of the franchise at an election.” 
Marathon County District Attorney Theresa Wetzsteon did not return an email Wednesday seeking comment.
The U.S. Election Assistance Commission has a series of recommendations to ensure the safety of drop boxes not located inside buildings, including that they be under video surveillance, secured, in a well-lit area and a clear chain of custody is created for the retrieval of ballots. The Wausau drop box was under video surveillance but had not yet been bolted down.
Diny insisted he did nothing wrong. The city attorney, Anne Jacobson, did not return messages seeking comment Wednesday.
“If somebody would have put it in their pickup truck and drove it away, the police would be looking for them for theft of property,” Diny said. The drop box is safe inside City Hall while the issue is unresolved, he said.
Wausau resident Pamela Bannister, speaking at a city council meeting Tuesday night, called for Diny to apologize and return the drop box.
“This is the kind of action that’s designed to stir the pot,” Bannister said. “It does not tamp down the rhetoric that we’re all facing in this election cycle. It accomplishes nothing positive and amounts to, in my estimation, voting interference and intimidation.”",True,Doug Diny,Doug Diny,Doug Diny,"Katie Rosenberg

DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Red Wings signed forward Lucas Raymond to an eight-year, $64.6 million contract Monday, completing a deal with one of their best young players less than 72 hours before training camp begins.
Raymond will count $8.075 million against the salary cap through 2032. The 22-year-old was a restricted free agent without a contract for the upcoming NHL season and was coming off setting career highs with 31 goals, 41 assists and 72 points.
The Red Wings have another one of those in defenseman Moritz Seider, who won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year in 2021-22.
Detroit is looking to end an eight-year playoff drought dating to the Original Six franchise’s last appearance in 2016.
Raymond, a Swede who was the fourth pick in 2020, has 174 points in 238 games since breaking into the league.

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — At least 30 bodies were found on a boat drifting off the coast of Senegal’s capital, the military said Monday, as the number of migrants leaving West Africa increases. 
The navy was informed of the vessel’s presence on Sunday evening and sent out a boat patrol to the area, 70 kilometers (38 nautical miles) from Dakar, Ibrahima Sow, spokesperson for Senegal’s military said in a statement.
“So far, 30 bodies have been counted,” Sow said.
The advanced state of decomposition of the bodies is making the identification process very difficult, the military said, adding that investigations will provide more information on the death toll and the boat’s origin.
Earlier this month, a boat carrying 89 people on board capsized off the coast of Senegal. At least 37 people died, according to Senegalese authorities.
Many of the migrants leaving West Africa through Senegal flee conflict, poverty and a lack of jobs. Most head to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the coast of West Africa, which is used as a stepping stone to continental Europe.
Since the beginning of the year, more than 22,300 people have landed on the Canary Islands, 126% more than the same period last year, according to statistics released by Spain’s Interior Ministry.
Last month, the Senegalese army said it had arrested 453 migrants and “members of smuggling networks” as part of a 12-day operation patrolling the coastline. More than half of those arrested were Senegalese nationals, the army said.


In July, a boat carrying 300 migrants, mostly from Gambia and Senegal, capsized off Mauritania. More than a dozen died and at least 150 others went missing.
The Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, the Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands this year alone.
Migrant vessels that get lost or run into problems often vanish in the Atlantic, with some drifting across the ocean for months until they are found in the Caribbean and Latin America carrying only human remains.

WESTBY, Wisconsin (AP) — President Joe Biden traveled to rural southwest Wisconsin on Thursday to champion new investments in electrification and expanded high-speed internet, proclaiming that “all these investments mean family farms can stay in the family.” 
In the town of Westby, Biden announced $7.3 billion in investments for 16 cooperatives that will provide electricity for millions of families in rural areas across 23 states, with the goal of lowering the cost of badly needed electricity connections in hard-to-reach areas. 
Funding for the project comes from the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022 and passed in Congress along party lines. The law invests roughly $13 billion in rural electrification across multiple programs and will create 4,500 permanent jobs and 16,000 construction jobs, according to the White House, which called the effort the largest investment in rural electrification since the New Deal in the 1930s. 
Biden also championed 2021’s infrastructure law, which was approved with some support from congressional Republicans and which he said had provided 72,000 additional Wisconsin homes and small businesses with high-speed internet. 
“Just like we’re making the most significant investment in rural electrification since FDR, we’re also making the most significant investment ever in affordable, high-speed internet because affordable high-speed internet is just as essential today as electricity was a century ago,” Biden said, referring to New Deal architect and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 


Biden said “all of these investments mean family farms can stay in the family, rural entrepreneurs can build their dreams, your children and grandchildren won’t have to leave home to make a living.” 
“That’s stopping now because we’re spreading opportunities to benefit everyone,” he added. 
Before talking policy, Biden addressed Wednesday’s school shooting in Georgia, where a 14-year-old student fatally shot four people. The president lamented that, during a back-to-school season that should have been a “joyous and exciting,” another community in America was instead left “absolutely shattered” by gun violence. 
Biden endorsed calls for stricter requirements for owners to lock up and better secure their firearms — leaning into the fact that he himself is a gun owner. 
“There are too many people who are able to access guns that shouldn’t be able to,” he said. “So let’s require safe storage of firearms. I know I’ve mine locked up.”
Biden also praised Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he endorsed after dropping his reelection bid in July. And he sharply criticized her opponent in November, former President Donald Trump, for failing to keep promises to spur public works and instead running up towering federal deficits by passing tax cuts that Biden argued primarily benefited the rich. 
“In thousands of cities and towns across the country and across Wisconsin, we’re seeing the great American comeback story,” Biden said, contrasting that with Trump and top Republicans who he said talk “about how bad off we are.” 
“Today’s announcement is about far more than just giving rural America the power to turn on the lights. It’s about giving the power to shape our own future,” Biden said. 
Democrats consider Wisconsin to be one of the must-win states in November’s presidential election between Trump and Harris. Biden won the state in 2020 by about 20,000 votes, flipping Wisconsin to the Democratic column after Trump narrowly won it in 2016.
Thursday was also personal for Biden, who returned to Wisconsin to revisit a promise he made early in his presidency to provide, among other infrastructure improvements, better internet to rural areas.
“It isn’t a luxury; it’s now a necessity, like water and electricity,” Biden said at the La Crosse Municipal Transit Utility in June 2021. White House deputy chief of staff Natalie Quillian said the latest visit means Biden has “delivered on so many of those promises.”

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Oakmont’s already massive greens will be even more daunting when the men’s U.S. Open returns next summer for a record 10th time.
The club situated in the northern Pittsburgh suburbs has restored more than 24,000 square feet of green surface over the last two years as part of a renovation guided by golf course architect Gil Hanse.
Hanse initially was brought in to focus on the bunkers. During his trips to the course, he came across photographs from the 1920s and 1930s and noticed the greens used to be much larger before several factors — time and natural erosion most of all — began chipping away at them.
He talked to the club, whose membership enthusiastically agreed the renovations were a chance to make the notoriously fast greens even harder than they were when Dustin Johnson won his first major at Oakmont in 2016.
While the changes this time around won’t be quite as visible as they have in the past — Oakmont has spent most of the last 30 years removing thousands of trees in hopes of returning to its wind-swept, links-style roots — the 155 players who will join defending champion Bryson DeChambeau could find pins tucked in places they’ve never been before during previous Open stops at the venerable course that opened in 1904.
“The greens are the No. 1 defense on the course,” grounds superintendent Mike McCormick said Monday. “Oakmont, in today’s world, it’s not a crazy long golf course. There are several holes out here the players will be hitting wedges into and it puts even more of an emphasis on (the greens).”


The course will play at 7,372 yards as a par 70 in 2025, a tick up from the 7,219 yards it played at in 2016.
One of the new pin options the expanded greens give the USGA is on the 182-yard, par-3 13th hole. Pin placement previously was limited to the left side of the green, with little wiggle room in terms of yardage. Now there are a variety of options, including a back-right pin that sits in the middle of a bowl, rewarding a good shot but almost inaccessible from other portions of the green, particularly the front right.
U.S. Open scores have trended lower of late. Only one of the last eight winners has posted a higher four-round total in relation to par than Johnson’s 4-under 276, with the last six champions all finishing at 6-under or better.
Scott Langley, the USGA’s senior director of player relations, thinks Oakmont remains one of the stiffest tests because it lacks the kind of shot options places like Pinehurst No. 2 (2024) or Los Angeles Country Club (2023) provide.
“You have strategic width (in those places), you can play the angles more,” Langley said. “There are spots here where you do that. But by and large, Oakmont is you hit a good shot or you don’t. And if you don’t, the penalty is pretty uniform.”
The more notable changes besides the greens are a new-look fairway on the 485-yard, par-4 seventh hole that offers players two choices: play it safe and short to the right but settle for a blind approach or aim left and try to carry a drive 320+ yards over a fairway bunker that if executed correctly lets you see the pin on your approach with a short iron.
Oakmont also rebuilt every hazard and revamped the course’s nearly 200 bunkers while updating the drainage system. The club was hit by nearly 3 inches of rain during the early rounds of the U.S. Open’s last visit, forcing the grounds crew and volunteers to get creative while bailing out the sand traps.
“The bunkers had deteriorated significantly from 2016 to 2022,” McCormick said. “There’s a lot of newer technology and ways to drain bunkers and hold sand and limit contamination. So the club had an opportunity to make sure that the performance of the playing surfaces (remained consistent).”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Shohei Ohtani hit his 46th home run of the season to tie his career high, a 450-foot solo shot down the right-field line in the fifth inning of the Los Angeles Dodgers’ 4-0 victory over the Cleveland Guardians on a sweltering Sunday.
On a day that matched the hottest Dodger Stadium first-pitch temperature at 103 degrees, Ohtani connected off Cleveland starter Tanner Bibee. The homer was reviewed to see if it was fair.
 Ohtani also hit 46 home runs in 2021 for the Los Angeles Angels in his unanimous AL MVP season. The Japanese star has 46 stolen bases in a bid to become the first major league player with a 50-50 season.
It also was 103 for first pitch for Game 1 of the 2017 World Series against Houston.

GENEVA (AP) — U.N.-backed human rights investigators on Friday urged the creation of an “independent and impartial force” to protect civilians in Sudan’s war, blaming both sides for war crimes including murder, mutilation and torture and warning that foreign governments which arm and finance them could be complicit.
The fact-finding team, in their first report since being created by the U.N.’s main human rights body in October, also accused the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which are fighting Sudan’s army, and its allies of crimes against humanity, including rape, sexual slavery and persecution on ethnic or gender grounds.
“The people of Sudan have suffered greatly, and the violations against them must stop. This cannot be done without ending the fighting,” Mohamed Chande Othman, the chair of the team, told a news conference.
The experts called for the expansion of an arms embargo on Sudan’s long-restive western Darfur region to the entire country.
The findings from the team mandated by the 47-country Human Rights Council come as more than 10 million people have been driven from their homes — including more than 2 million to neighboring countries — and famine has broken out in one large camp for displaced people in Darfur.
The conflict that erupted in April 2023 has killed untold thousands of people, and humanitarian groups are struggling to gain access to people in need. In December, the U.N. Security Council voted to end the world body’s political mission in the country under pressure from the military leadership. 


While the killings, displacements and forced starvation have been long known, the call for creation of an independent force marks the latest sign of desperation from rights advocates both within the country and abroad to halt the bloodshed, displacement and food crisis.
“Given the failure of the parties to protect civilians so far, the fact-finding mission recommends the deployment of an independent and impartial force with a mandate to protect civilians in Sudan,” the team’s report said.
The experts didn’t specify what might make up that force, nor did they say which countries might be complicit in the crimes through their backing of rival sides. Sudan’s military has accused the United Arab Emirates of supporting the RSF, a claim that the Gulf country has denied. 
Neighboring Egypt is among the backers of Sudan’s armed forces. 
“The fact-finding mission considers that fighting will stop once the arms flow stops,” the report said. It called for an immediate end to funneling weapons, ammunition and other support to any side, “as there is a risk that those supplying arms may be complicit in grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law.”
The experts focused on a period from January and August this year. They visited three neighboring countries and took testimonies from more than 180 survivors, relatives and witnesses to the conflict that now has spread to 14 of Sudan’s 18 states.
Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, a team member, said conflict-related sexual violence had a “long and tragic history” in Sudan, and civilians — overwhelmingly women and girls — “were, and continue to be, targeted with sexual violence in particular rape (and) gang rape by both parties to the conflict.”
Earlier this month, talks in Geneva convened by the United States, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia made some headway in getting aid into Sudan, but mediators lamented the lack of participation of Sudan’s armed forces. Egypt, the UAE, the African Union and the United Nations were also involved in the talks.
The U.N. World Food Program in Sudan reported that trucks carrying 100 metric tons of food entered Sudan on Friday through the Adre crossing from Chad, which reopened on Aug. 20. 
Since then, WFP has transported a total of 1,500 metric tons of food and nutrition supplies, enough for 130,000 people, United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.
Some aid has already been delivered to Mornei in West Darfur, an area at famine risk, he said. The rest is on its way to other West Darfur communities that are at risk of famine, though no aid is getting into the North Darfur capital, El Fasher, which is besieged by the RSF, Dujarric said. 
The fact-finding team has little power to affect events on the ground in what the U.N. has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Its report mainly serves to train a spotlight on rights abuses and violations for the world community and help inform International Criminal Court prosecutors.
Othman, speaking to The Associated Press, said that the team hadn’t compiled “concrete evidence” about which countries were funneling weapons and money to the rival sides beyond what they had seen in media reports, but that the issue was “worth investigating.”
“It should be assigned to some person or some agency to look into it, because it is serious in the context of the protracted war in Sudan,” he said.

CINCINNATI (AP) — The search for a new manager for the Cincinnati Reds will begin immediately following the firing of David Bell after six seasons, president of baseball operations Nick Krall said Monday.
The team announced the move on Sunday night hours after a 2-0 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bench coach Freddie Benavides was named interim manager for the final five games of the season. Most of the other coaches will be retained until a new manager is hired.
Krall cited inconsistency, philosophical differences, players not playing to their potential, and some young players who were added to the roster last season not developing as fast as the organization had hoped.
“When you look across the board, I thought we should have been better,” he said.
The 52-year-old Bell — whose grandfather Gus and father Buddy both spent part of their careers playing in Cincinnati — was hired by the Reds in October 2018. He had a 409-456 record over six seasons.
His contract had been extended in July 2023.
“We made the decision to extend David last season because I thought we were moving in the right direction as we promoted a younger core of players to develop in the big leagues,” Krall said. “But after reflecting on everything this season, I decided we needed to move in another direction with the leadership in the major league clubhouse. That’s why we made the change.”
With a week left in the season, the Reds are 76-81 and in fourth place in the NL Central, 13 1/2 games behind division champion Milwaukee. Cincinnati closes out the season with five road games. The Reds have a two-game series in Cleveland on Tuesday and Wednesday before closing out the campaign with three games in Chicago against the Cubs. 


“If we make the decision now it allows us to meet with everybody (in the organization) on the last road trip, it allows us to start this process and it gives us a week head start instead of waiting when you know what the decision is going to be,” Krall said.
Under Bell in 2020, the Reds earned a postseason berth in his second season, which was shortened by COVID-19 to 60 games.
The Reds finished the 2021 season with a respectable 83-79 record, good enough for third place in the National League Central. That season also produced a National League Rookie of the Year in second baseman Jonathan India. 
In 2022, Cincinnati lost 100 games for the first time in four decades. The Reds improved to 82-80 in 2023, despite leading the major leagues with 650 games missed by players because of injuries.
This season began with high expectations that Bell and the Reds couldn’t meet. A lack of consistency was the trend throughout the season, exacerbated by injuries to key players.
During Bell’s tenure, the Reds brought along a talented core expected to put the organization back on top, including India, Hunter Greene, Elly De La Cruz and Matt McLain. But Cincinnati hasn’t been able to get over the hump. 
Bell is the third manager fired this season. The Chicago White Sox fired Pedro Grifol and three coaches on Aug. 8, just days after the team ended a 21-game losing streak that tied the American League record.
The Seattle Mariners fired Scott Servais on Aug. 22, in the middle of his ninth season with the team.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans are pointing to newly released immigration enforcement data to bolster their argument that the Biden administration is letting migrants who have committed serious crimes go free in the U.S. But the numbers have been misconstrued without key context.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement released data to Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales in response to a request he made for information about people under ICE supervision either convicted of crimes or facing criminal charges. Gonzales’ Texas district includes an 800-mile stretch bordering Mexico.
Gonzales posted the numbers online and they immediately became a flashpoint in the presidential campaign between former President Donald Trump, who has vowed to carry out mass deportations, and Vice President Kamala Harris. Immigration — and the Biden administration’s record on border security — has become a key issue in the election.
Here’s a look at the data and what it does or doesn’t show:
As of July 21, ICE said 662,556 people under its supervision were either convicted of crimes or face criminal charges. Nearly 15,000 were in its custody, but the vast majority — 647,572 — were not.
Included in the figures of people not detained by ICE were people found guilty of very serious crimes: 13,099 for homicide, 15,811 for sexual assault, 13,423 for weapons offenses and 2,663 for stolen vehicles. The single biggest category was for traffic-related offenses at 77,074, followed by assault at 62,231 and dangerous drugs at 56,533.


The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, later clarified that the numbers span decades — including the Trump administration and other presidencies — and that those not in its custody may be detained by a state or local agency. It’s a distinction ICE didn’t make in its report to Gonzales.

“When we speak of somebody who is not detained, we mean not detained in ICE custody. The individual could be in Folsom State Prison, for example,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday. 
Millions of people are on ICE’s “non-detained docket,” or people under the agency’s supervision who aren’t in its custody. Many are awaiting outcomes of their cases in immigration court, including some wearing monitoring devices. Others have been released after completing their prison sentences because their countries won’t take them back.
Republicans pointed to the data as proof that the Biden administration is letting immigrants with criminal records into the country and isn’t doing enough to kick out those who commit crimes while they’re here.
“The truth is clear — illegal immigrants with a criminal record are coming into our country. The data released by ICE is beyond disturbing, and it should be a wake-up call for the Biden-Harris administration and cities across the country that hide behind sanctuary policies,” Gonzales said in a news release, referring to pledges by local officials to limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
Trump, who has repeatedly portrayed immigrants as bringing lawlessness and crime to America, tweeted multiple screenshots of the data with the words: “13,000 CROSSED THE BORDER WITH MURDER CONVICTIONS.”
He also asserted that the numbers correspond to Biden and Harris’ time in office.
The data was being misinterpreted, Homeland Security said in a statement Sunday.
“The data goes back decades; it includes individuals who entered the country over the past 40 years or more, the vast majority of whose custody determination was made long before this Administration,” the agency said. “It also includes many who are under the jurisdiction or currently incarcerated by federal, state or local law enforcement partners.”
Mayorkas said it was “unfortunate” the information didn’t come with proper explanation, saying that “lends itself to misinterpretation, either deliberate or otherwise.” 
The department also stressed what it has done to deport those without the right to stay in America, saying it had removed or returned more than 700,000 people in the past year, which it said was the highest number since 2010. Homeland Security said it had removed 180,000 people with criminal convictions since President Joe Biden took office.
The data isn’t only listing people who entered the country during the Biden administration but includes people going back decades who came during previous administrations, said Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was the predecessor to ICE. 
They’re accused or convicted of committing crimes in America as opposed to committing crimes in other countries and then entering the U.S., said Meissner, who is now director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.
“This is not something that is a function of what the Biden administration did,” she said. “Certainly, this includes the Biden years, but this is an accumulation of many years, and certainly going back to at least 2010, 2011, 2012.”
A 2017 report by Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General says that as of August 2016, ICE had about 368,574 people on its non-detained docket who were convicted criminals. By June 2021, shortly after Trump left office, that number was up to 405,786.
ICE has limited resources. The number of people it supervises has skyrocketed, while its staffing has not. As the agency noted in a 2023 end-of-year report, it often has to send staff to help at the border, taking them away from their normal duties. 
The number of people ICE supervises but who aren’t in its custody has grown from 3.3 million a little before Biden took office to a little over 7 million last spring.
“The simple answer is that as a system, we haven’t devoted enough resources to the parts of the government that deal with monitoring and ultimately removing people who are deportable,” Meissner said.
ICE also has logistical and legal limits on who they can hold. Its budget allows the agency to hold 41,500 people at a time. John Sandweg, who was acting ICE director from 2013 to 2014 under then-President Barack Obama, said holding people accused or convicted of the most serious crimes is always the top priority. 
But once someone has a final order of removal — meaning a court has found that they don’t have the right to stay in the country — they cannot be held in detention forever while ICE works out how to get them home. A 2001 Supreme Court ruling essentially prevented ICE from holding those people for more than six months if there is no reasonable chance to expect they can be sent back. 
Not every country is willing to take back their citizens, Sandweg said. 
He said he suspects that a large number of those convicted of homicide but not held by ICE are people who were ordered deported but the agency can’t remove them because their home country won’t take them back. 
“It’s a very common scenario. Even amongst the countries that take people back, they can be very selective about who they take back,” he said.
The U.S. also could run into problems deporting people to countries with which it has tepid relations.
Homeland Security did not respond to questions about how many countries won’t take back their citizens. The 2017 watchdog report put the number at 23 countries, plus an additional 62 that were cooperative but where there were delays getting things like passports or travel documents.",True,"662,556","662,556","662,556","70%

LONDON, Ky. (AP) — A manhunt was underway early Sunday as police searched for a gunman in a rural area of southeastern Kentucky near Interstate 75, according to authorities who said seven people were hurt in the shooting and a vehicle accident that accompanied the violence.
The shooting Saturday was followed by an intense search for a suspect by multiple law enforcement agencies. The Laurel County Sheriff’s Office said in a post on Facebook that it was an “active shooter situation” and “numerous persons” were shot near the highway. 
Deputy Gilbert Acciardo, a spokesperson for the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office, said authorities were notified about 5:30 p.m. Saturday about gunshots along Interstate 75. When they arrived at the scene in London, a small city of about 8,000 located about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Lexington, they found numerous vehicles on the side of the highway at Exit 49.
“When our first two units got to the scene there, they said it was a madhouse: people on the sides of the road, emergency flashers going, bullet holes, windows shot out, nine vehicles shot. Can you imagine that? Just chaotic,” Acciardo said during a news conference Sunday.
Five people were shot and all were in stable condition early Sunday, although some of the victims had “very serious” injuries, including one person who was shot in the face, Acciardo said. 
Two other people were hurt in the vehicle accident, he said.


Police blocked traffic in both directions on the highway because they did not know where the bullets came from. “We’re still attempting to determine that,” Acciardo said. 
Authorities believe there was only one shooter and Acciardo said they do not believe the shooting was sparked by road rage.
Officers from multiple law enforcement agencies searched a remote, wooded area, but eventually suspended the search because of darkness. The search will resume at daybreak Sunday, he said.
“We do have the area contained right now. It’s a very fluid investigation. Our people are still on the scene. Our special response team is there. We are trying to find a shooter there,” Acciardo said.
The sheriff’s office said a “Person of Interest” has been identified in connection with the shooting, saying he should be considered armed and dangerous and people should not approach him. The man’s name was given as Joseph A. Couch, a 32-year-old white male, and anyone with information about his location was urged to call the county 911 center. 
Acciardo cautioned that authorities “have not determined that this is the individual that fired the weapon.”
State lawmakers from Laurel County urged residents in the area to stay home as police continued to search for the shooter. 
“Without a doubt, this is an act of senseless violence that does not reflect the values of this community, our Commonwealth, or its people,” they said in a statement.
The interstate was closed 9 miles (14 kilometers) north of London but reopened about three hours later, according to the sheriff’s office.
In an video update on Facebook late Saturday night, London Mayor Randall Weddle tried to calm fears as the search continued for the gunman. He urged residents to call 911 if they hear or see anything suspicious near their homes.
“We’re asking folks please do not go outside your home shooting because we might have first responders in that area. It’s important to know you are safe. We have multiple agencies in this community, in the city of London and in Laurel County,” Weddle said.
Weddle said searchers “know the general area where this individual is,” but he would not release specific details.
“I am receiving initial reports from the Kentucky State Police and our Office of Homeland Security — together we are actively monitoring the situation and offering support in any way possible,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a post on the social platform X. “Please pray for everyone involved.”",True,Joseph A. Couch,Joseph A. Couch,Joseph A. Couch,"No information available

NEW YORK (AP) — Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans says the sense of urgency that younger generations bring to solving international challenges needs to be nurtured in the rest of the world.
“So many of the world’s most prolific movements were started by people when they were young,” Hugh Evans said, noting that Martin Luther King Jr. was only 34 when he delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. “Can you imagine that? (Nelson) Mandela was 26 when he co-founded the ANC Youth League. Malala (Yousafzai) was 11 when she gave her first protest speech. And my hero (William) Wilberforce was 21 when he entered into politics. So we have to get our skates on.”
The Associated Press spoke with Evans shortly before Saturday’s Global Citizen Festival in New York, am event headlined by superstars like Post Malone and Doja Cat, as well as breakout artists like Benson Boone and Rauw Alejandro. The festival generated more than $1 billion in new commitments to fight extreme poverty, as well as a new partnership with FIFA in which Global Citizen supporters get tickets to matches by taking action on humanitarian issues. 
The interview was edited for clarity and length.
A: We’re operating against the backdrop of a world with constant shocks -- the ongoing shock of recovering from the pandemic and now the shocks of global conflicts. That has resulted in the first time in our lifetime where poverty for the last three years has been on the increase. We’re talking about 719 million people now living on less than $2.15 a day worldwide. The other big shock that the world hasn’t yet fully experienced is the shock of climate change, which has the potential to push another 100 million people into extreme poverty in the next ten years.


A: Those are our big pushes this time. We want to address the reality that the world is confronting multiple crises at once.
A: Based on our most recent data, over 70% of our members are Gen Z. We need to continue to double down on that. It’s fueled by the reality that I think we have a model of activism powered through the Global Citizen app that young people can relate to. And it gives them the power of putting activism and advocacy within their own hands. I think that our approach has always been to try to equip young people with the best, most thoughtful policy asks that are backed by incredible research and data and have the ability to have the most profound impact to bring an end to extreme poverty.
